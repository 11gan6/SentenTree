	a fair review and some advice.i want to be fair to dan brown.	1
	elitist literary critics say that brown is not a good writer, and that his stories are bland.	1
	i personally think that if you manage to genuinely entertain and awe your audiences, then you have accomplished something worthy of reading.	1
	i also think that 'the da vinci code' was nearly an impossible act to follow.	1
	people will have all sorts of crazy expectations for your next book that you won't be able to fulfill.	1
	as such, i write this review as fair as i can, trying to assess it on its own merits, but comparisons are inevitable.	1
	the lost symbol isn't a bad book, but it is a letdown.	1
	i didn't like this one for the same reason i didn't like angels and demons as much.	1
	also, brown doesn't advance the story at a good pace.	1
	a good two-thirds of the book (i'm not exaggerating, i counted the pages) was filled with variations on such a scene: character a: have you heard of x?character b (usually langdon): yes, but i thought that was just a myth.character a shows or tells b something.character b reacts with shock.then, insert scenes of people walking from one place to another, being chased.	1
	then, insert the sentence 'suddenly everything made sense.'	1
	at least for the next ten pages.repeat.	1
	after reading this, i had to wonder whether brown is a writer on lost, where people can't seem to give straight answers, and where scenes never resolve any questions.	1
	here's my advice to dan brown: 1. fire your editor.	1
	there were some whole passages, even chapters, that served no purpose other than to inflate your book to an unnecessary size.	1
	i don't mind reading big books, but i do mind reading through unnecessary words.	1
	ch.	1
	69, for example, is unnecessary.	1
	if your editor didn't ask you to take it out, then he should be fired.	1
	sorry.	1
	2. we don't need to know exactly how every character moves from one location to the next, which turn they took, what street they walked across.	1
	if it serves the plot, if the geography is important (as it was in angels and demons), then fine.	1
	geography was crucial at certain moments in this book, but many times, the passages when you describe how someone moves from one part of a house to another part, what door they opened and closed, all that is boring and tedious.	1
	3. don't write your novel like a screenplay.	1
	whether you've done it consciously or not, your short chapters read as if you had in mind exactly what camera shots you expect out of an inevitable movie adaptation.	1
	leave that to the screenwriter.	1
	if they can adapt a book like 'naked lunch,' they can surely adapt your book as well.	1
	write your novel as a novel.	1
	4. be careful of hubris.	1
	you're in a unique and rare position that, i'm sure, many authors dream of: your books will sell millions by default and you will get a multi-million dollar movie deal without question.	1
	good for you!	1
	some authors handle that well (e.g.	1
	j.k. rowling), some don't (e.g.	1
	stephen king, michael crichton).	1
	it's not that the latter are bad writers, but that they are capable of writing some really bad stuff.	1
	having said that, i'm not saying that the lost symbol is bad, just that it needs to lose about 100-pages of unnecessary, repetitive scenes.	1
	speaking of crichton, the reason i stopped reading him is that he became too formulaic.	1
	all his books are about a bunch of mismatched experts going to some remote location and something goes wrong.	1
	formula isn't bad per se.	1
	rowling is formulaic too.	1
	most of her books revolve around the hogwarts school year, but she puts enough story in there to make it work.	1
	you should do more of that.	1
	5. know what you're good at.	1
	you know your technology, which makes your book authentic.	1
	you also know that your readers are likely to go google a painting or artist you mentioned and be awed by what you described.	1
	that's great!	1
	i bet that also saves you the pain of having to request reprint permissions of artwork and such.	1
	also, since most people don't know their history, let alone the etymology of words they use everyday, you have literally an endless supply of stories.	1
	that's what you're good at.	1
	i'd say, forget the science stuff.	1
	it's interesting, but, as with angels and demons, it's an awkward fit.	1
	i don't recall there being any modern science in the da vinci code and i was fine with that.	1
	6. try a recurring character.	1
	langdon is fine, but consider having a character or two that returns in subsequent books.	1
	make them interesting, of course, and don't make them a love interest.	1
	so, here's the good news.	1
	dan brown hasn't nuked the fridge, at least not for me.	1
	also, now that this book is out in the open, readers are likely to give his next book a much fairer assessment.	1
	so, i look forward to reading that, but, i probably won't be buying it on the first day it's out.      	1
	a page-turner, but often for the wrong reasons.	1
	.	1
	..a quick note on the ranking: i hold 5-star ratings in reserve for the best of the best.	1
	the previous robert langdon books i would rate at about 4 stars for being fun reads but nothing that would resemble a literary masterpiece.	1
	i enjoyed this book significantly less than the other two, hence the two stars.	1
	'the lost symbol' is not a bad book.	1
	while it would certainly rank it 3rd amongst the three robert langdon novels it is still an amusing read.	1
	i forgive brown for his weak writing style and i accept that he writes characters that are fairly two-dimensional with little personality outside of that which pertains explicitly to the story.	1
	i accept that this novel was going to have the exact same story structure and characters as the previous two.	1
	i accept that the relationships between people will be odd.	1
	i accept that most chapters will end with a variation on his cheap cliffhanger 'and then robert couldn't believe what he saw!'	1
	i accept all that.	1
	and yet, even with all those concessions, this one just left me flat.	1
	when it comes to the writing style i'm not entirely sure if i should be blaming brown or his editor (or, potentially, his lack thereof-which i guess would be blaming him).	1
	the style, while simple, could easily be smoothed out with an editor who was given some room to work.	1
	what hurts his prose is repetition of words and phrases over and over and over and over-often on the same page.	1
	sure, the story structure is an identical match to the first two with all the same types of characters and twists.	1
	but here's the issue, this time is just doesn't work like it did before.	1
	here's why: 1. robert langdon is officially a moron: he spends more time being lectured to and making wrong guesses than he does solving anything.	1
	his inner monologue serves to deliver some interesting asides, but nothing that helps forward the plot.	1
	i'm fairly certain he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book.	1
	he was completely marginalized.	1
	2. the science of noetics, as used in this book, is a complete throwaway with no bearing on the plot: in a&d; the science of matter and anti-matter played a significant role in the overall plot.	1
	it's relation to the big bang and religion as well as its overall implementation throughout the story was essential.	1
	here, the noetics pops up just enough to be annoying once you realize it serves no primary purpose.	1
	also, noetics is barely a science.	1
	reading this book would make one think it's far more legitimate than it is.	1
	i was fascinated several years ago when i first heard it mentioned.	1
	upon further research one finds that it is more wishful thinking than science and that it has very little actual research and support.	1
	closer looks at studies (the water that has been 'loved' is a favorite) show gaping holes, inconsistencies, and a complete lack of scientific method.	1
	while it may sound nice it just serves no purpose.	1
	3. the payoff just doesn't work: maybe we're out of major historical secrets to reveal to the world because this one just fizzles out.	1
	the build-up of this story often felt like it was stretching.	1
	in the previous robert langdon novels he finds himself moving between a great many locations surrounded by symbols and puzzles.	1
	here, he spends his time in a handful of buildings, several of which play no role in solving anything but are simply places for him to rest or think.	1
	i often found myself turning pages, not to see what happened next, but to see if anything happened next.	1
	the reveals in the first two were very cool.	1
	this one gets such hype and then comes the 'really?	1
	that's it.	1
	i just read 500 pages to find that out?	1
	there's a few hours i'll never have back.'	1
	moment.	1
	i can say, unequivocally, that when the special edition with all the pictures is released i will absolutely not be purchasing it.	1
	i just don't care to ever read this novel again.	1
	i learned a few things about history and there were some interesting parts.	1
	but overall it was just mediocre, and sometimes that's worse than being bad.      	1
	a decent followup to the da vinci code.i've read all of dan brown's books, and while i'm not a huge fan, i do enjoy his stories and the fantastical idea that there could be some huge conspiracy or esoterica out there that only a few people know about.	1
	dan brown's writing could use some work, and he's not crafting great literature here, but the content of his stories usually makes up for that, and his latest novel, the lost symbol, is no exception.	1
	this is the third book to follow robert langdon, a harvard symbologist who previously showed up in , and .	1
	the lost symbol is very similar to his previous books, in that it has the same formulaic plot, structure, and theme, only this time it takes place in washington, d.c. and involves the freemasons instead of the knights templar.	1
	just like in the da vinci code, langdon is called to washington at a friend's request, only to find him missing, and spends the rest of the book chasing clues throughout the city and trying to outwit a new villain who is seemingly as smart as he is.	1
	as mentioned above, the formula in the lost symbol is almost exactly the same.	1
	after only a few chapters into the book, i started drawing immediate comparisons to , and i could see some readers making that claim if it weren't for a few exceptions:  langdon is more likable than ben gates, the mysteries are much more involved and well-researched, and there is noticeably more action and suspense.	1
	this time, rather than trying to ignore some rather large plot holes, as contained in the da vinci code, you will have to suspend your disbelief that a harvard professor is physically capable of so many close calls.	1
	it almost reads more like an ian fleming novel than a book about a mid-50s professor trying to solve a centuries-old scavenger hunt.	1
	that works out well because a lot of books of this genre can get weighed down by the scientific or historical aspects and bore you to death.	1
	that's not to say that the lost symbol doesn't have its faults.	1
	the first is most notably the writing.	1
	while it has certainly improved since the da vinci code, it still seems rather sophomoric, and not on par with someone who is one of the biggest-selling authors in the last twenty years.	1
	even though it's fiction, some of the characters' actions really made me wonder if brown has had much human contact while writing the book.	1
	there are other annoyances that he repeats in the book, but i won't bring them up for fear that mentioning them may cause future readers to have their attention constantly drawn to them.	1
	overall though, the writing is not terrible and the plot is suspenseful enough that i can overlook it.	1
	another theme that brown plays around with is the concept of 'mind over matter.'	1
	he provides a great deal of research on the subject (too much in some chapters), but i still found it a little too out there, and wish he had chosen a different angle.	1
	i think this book will appeal not only to dan brown fans, but to fans of douglas preston and lee child (langdon is almost a clone of the agent pendergast character), james rollins, michael crichton (there are certainly a lot of influences here as far as research into a book goes), and with this book, clive cussler (the action is on par with anything dirk pitt would see).	1
	if i had to rank it, i would put the lost symbol below angels and demons, and above da vinci code.	1
	while i don't think it's worth of 5 stars, it was certainly an enjoyable read and enough to satiate me until the next book comes out (provided he doesn't wait as long as he did for this one).      	1
	lost respect with this one.so poor an effort i felt compelled to write even though this review will be buried so deeply i can't believe it will be read.	1
	the writing is ponderous.	1
	the epiphanies are telegraphed.	1
	somehow, langdon has become an idiot and is repeatedly adamant about some point and subsequently shocked to discover he was wrong.	1
	there is serious overuse of characters knowing or seeing something the reader doesnt-- a cheesy device better used in bad movies.	1
	the big reveal is exceedingly lame.	1
	the end is weak, preachy and too slow to arrive.	1
	other than that, not bad.      	1
	all too familiar....have to agree with many of the posters here.	1
	too many cliched characters: the diminutive japanese cia lady straight out of 'the incredibles'; the tatooed protagonist just the albino from dvc in reverse; the evil turkish prison guard from 'midnight express,' the wise religious man who sees with his hands...i could go on and on.	1
	forget the so-called science.	1
	you can see the plot twists coming a mile away.	1
	is there anyone who didn't know the true identity of the villain immediately?	1
	or the location where it would all end?	1
	or what was inside the box langdon was given?	1
	but i think when it got to the 'drowning' scene, i lost it completely.	1
	i simply could not believe he would re-create a scene from a 20-year-old movie.	1
	what hasn't been mentioned here is the absolute idiocy of the characters' behavior.	1
	a brilliant scientist lets a stranger into her secret lab because she receives a text message?	1
	who wouldn't question that?	1
	by her own admission, her brother didn't even know how to text!	1
	the use of phone messages throughout is maddening.	1
	a major cia director hears someone saying, 'i'll be there in 20 minutes' and never questions that he might be lying?	1
	langdon flies off at a moment's notice without any confirmation that the person he's speaking to represents the person he says he does?	1
	and sure, i'll bring along this sacred thing that i've been told to keep hidden for years just because you say so!	1
	db keeps using this same device over and over and it simply defies all sense.	1
	'oh, well, this person says he's my brother's doctor--my brother who's been missing--so, sure, i'll just run right over there and have a chat with him.'	1
	in a private home that looks nothing like a doctor's office.	1
	'sure, i'll have some tea!'	1
	and why on earth would a wealthy and powerful man like peter solomon not have some kind of security around to begin with?	1
	would the guard at his building really let a limousine pass through without seeing who was in the back seat?	1
	no video cameras anywhere to capture him carrying out an unconscious man?	1
	too much...just, too much.	1
	plus the repetition.	1
	i wish someone would count the number of times langdon says something like, 'but the blah-blah is just blah-blah,' only to be shown a few pages later that--omg, i never thought of it that way!	1
	after the fiftieth time it happens, wouldn't langdon maybe keep his mouth shut or learn that things 'aren't always what they seem'?	1
	and the ending.	1
	without giving anything away, what exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the answer is already known?	1
	doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with?	1
	it's not really such a big secret after all, is it?	1
	why wouldn't everyone be screaming it from the rooftops instead of shrouding it in secrecy?	1
	i literally could go on and on.	1
	you could teach a course in senseless plot points based on this book.      	1
	the further adventures of robert langdon.when i have the luxury of time, i browse the shelves of a real bricks and sticks bookstore, collect a pile of books to take a closer look at and then settle into one of the comfy chairs so kindly provided by management for me to do so and start reading.	1
	with some books i need only read a page or two, with others the first couple of chapters.	1
	'buy' and 'don't buy' piles are made, money changes hands and i feel happy and excited about the adventures in store as i drive home.	1
	*sigh*  i love books... my point?	1
	if i'd never heard of dan brown and if the lost symbol had been one of those books i decided to take a closer look at, it would have gone into the 'don't buy' pile.	1
	the use of 'adorned' twice and 'the skull cradled in his palms' three times in the 3 page prologue would have had me wincing a little and doubting the skill of both the writer and the editor.	1
	and i probably wouldn't have given it a chance.	1
	but i have heard of brown and i read the davinci code.	1
	while it didn't convince me that brown was an amazing writer, it did convince me that he could tell an entertaining tale; one that engaged my mind and made me curious about historical events i was previously only vaguely aware of.	1
	some repeated phrases in the lost symbol's prologue weren't going to keep me from seeing if this story might be similarly engaging.	1
	it is - nearly.	1
	the lost symbol is as fast paced as the davinci code and, while the subject matter didn't strike quite the same note of interest for me, i still found it engrossing.	1
	brown (who seems to identify quite closely with his protagonist) continues to utilize the annoying device he used repeatedly in the davinci code of telling us that someone has knowledge we need but refusing to reveal it to us for pages and pages.	1
	i managed to avoid letting that spoil my enjoyment.	1
	i know very little about the freemasons and have never previously heard of the invisible college.	1
	certainly, i don't have the knowledge to know how much brown twisted history and fudged facts in the lost symbol.	1
	(i'm sure i'll be reading about every inaccuarcy in the next few days, though - over and over and over...) but, to be perfectly honest, i don't care.	1
	the lost symbol is a novel and i read it as such.	1
	for the historical events alluded to in the story that piqued my interest - and happily, there were a number of them - i can do my own research.	1
	doing just that after reading the davinci code was half the fun of that book.	1
	so, it could be argued that my enjoyment of the lost symbol, now that i've finished reading it, is just beginning is the lost symbol great literature?	1
	alas, most would concede that it is not.	1
	but is it an entertaining read?	1
	why yes, yes it is.   	1
	i'm pretty sure it went down like this:.three years ago, dan brown and top executives in hollywood and the publishing world assembled thomas harris, dean koontz, michael crichton, paulo coelho, jimmy wales, abir taha, and rhonda byrne in one room and said: 'hello and welcome, ladies and gentlemen.	1
	tonight you are being tasked with creating a novel of epic proportions  - one that will keep multitudes of airline travelers mildly entertained for a few hours while simultaneously insulting the intelligence of anyone who possesses anything higher than a bachelor's degree in communications.	1
	gripping intrigue; explosive revelations; multi-dimensional, original and sympathetic characters; realistic, cutting-edge technology; finely crafted and astonishing plot twists; meticulously researched detail - this book will have none of these!	1
	instead, randomly tear some pages out of your own manuscripts, staple them together and have the product on my desk by tuesday night; we need at least a week to whittle down your blathering drivel into a 120 minute screenplay.'	1
	'i'll be on the phone with hanks' agent negotiating a deal where we send him a blank check, and he reciprocates his end of the contract by laconically intoning his dialogue while stumbling about in a tweed jacket, so just slide whatever you come up with under my door.	1
	remember, it's got to be at least 450 pages - if it doesn't snap the strap of a timbuk2 messenger bag, it's not literature!'	1
	'someone needs to throw in at least three dozen references to 'things people do on the internet' too, please.	1
	you know, just try to work in the words 'iphone,' 'twitter,' blackberry,' and 'google' every ten pages, that way readers will know it's a taut techno-thriller.	1
	and set it in washington dc.	1
	yeah, like national treasure 2. people liked that, didn't they?	1
	jimmy, have your boys just print out everything they have on the freemasons, george washington and isaac newton.	1
	yeah, i know we used him before; we honestly don't know any other scientists.	1
	what do you mean your editors don't actually fact-check their information?	1
	so it's all just a hodgepodge of hearsay and conjecture?	1
	actually, that's perfect.'	1
	'so, yeah, we have to have a love interest, too.	1
	and by love interest i mean 'woman with whom the protagonist has no chemistry whatsoever.'	1
	i don't know, a beautiful, wealthy, impossibly intelligent woman who not only is involved in ground-breaking research in a scientific field that doesn't technically exist (but is going to change everything forever!)	1
	but also somehow gains the ability to make incredible leaps in logic minutes before our protagonist, thereby completely undermining the purpose of his entire character.	1
	which reminds me - we're going to need a villain, too.	1
	has there ever been a 6' tall, rich, muscular, bald, psychotic antagonist with giant tattoos who kidnaps his victims for the purposes of his own 'transformation'?	1
	what's that, tom, you don't think so?	1
	good - run with that.	1
	throw in a plot twist about him too.	1
	something that's never been done before.	1
	and how about some minor characters as well - an impeccably dressed black man who has keys that open every single door in washington, an old blind priest who speaks solely in riddles, and oh, what the hell, a deformed, female chain-smoking japanese midget with a gravelly voice.	1
	yup, all in the same book.'	1
	'um, ok folks, i think we're done here - oh, right, thanks rhonda, i almost forgot - the ending!	1
	people have been waiting years for dan's newest, colossal secret!	1
	one that will be sure to rock the very foundations of every society on our planet, destroy centuries-old beliefs and shatter ideologies into powdered glass!	1
	here it is - get ready - the bible.	1
	reading the bible will teach you things.	1
	things that every single human being alive already knows, but they don't know they know.	1
	but once these things are pointed out, people are going to feel incredibly stupid that they didn't see them before.	1
	but they're also going feel uplifted because they now know that they're one with god.	1
	or they're the same as god.	1
	or they made up god.	1
	or they're made of god.	1
	it doesn't matter.	1
	just mention 'god' and 'hope' and people will get all choked up.	1
	abir, you have some experience here - just make it sound spiritual, inspiring, and wishy-washy all at the same time.'	1
	'can you also make sure to bury this bible in some well-known, but highly implausible location that certainly won't be figured out in the first 20 pages by anyone more observant than a small, retarded child?	1
	i don't know, dean, somewhere in washington - but it's gotta have a pyramid on top.	1
	yeah, a pyramid, like at the louvre.	1
	dan likes pyramids, ok?	1
	are there any places like that in washington?	1
	anything vaguely pyramid-shaped?	1
	just google it, you'll find something.	1
	and make sure a shadowy government agency first tries to stop our protagonist, then ends up helping him using sophisticated technology that couldn't possibly do the things the book says it can do.	1
	just make something up - like time traveling thermal cameras or something.	1
	or how about that liquid breathing fluid stuff from the abyss?	1
	that's got blockbuster written all over it.	1
	no, michael, we're not actually going to mention the abyss in the book - that would be utterly ridiculous.	1
	'koontz?	1
	you had another question?	1
	yes, of course - i was just getting to that.	1
	every single chapter should end in a mini-cliffhanger that doesn't actually advance the plot, but instead leaves the readers completely unsatisfied, forcing them to stay awake for another two hours in order to reveal some insignificant and unlikely plot point.	1
	typically, each chapter should end with one character literally pointing out something to another character, but never telling the audience what it is they are pointing at until the reader has consumed at least 30 more pages.	1
	needless to say, the thing they are pointing at should leave both characters either 'shocked,' 'incredulous,' or 'amazed.'	1
	'everyone knows what to do?	1
	great.	1
	all right guys, let's get cracking.	1
	paulo, if you could stay behind for a minute; we found 87 more languages to translate your repetitive, mindless pedantry into.	1
	the rest of you, thanks for coming, please pick up your cartons of money on the way out...'   done.	1
	congratulations; you've just read the lost symbol.	1
	i just saved you $17.00 and six hours.	1
	no need to thank me.	1
	and if you're still interested in ciphers, riddles and secret messages, i've embedded my own within this review - a diabolical code that i spent as much time crafting as brown did on this steaming pile of pulp.	1
	fast-paced, but annoyingly manipulative and too long.the pages turned quickly, but this was in part because i found myself skimming the vast sections of religious philosophy, psuedo scientific mumbo-jumbo and pedantic exposition, all of which seemed to go on endlessly.	1
	the book builds and builds until the shockings truths are finally revealed.	1
	without disclosing any details, one of these shockers had been painfully obvious for some time and i was impatient for brown to just get it over with.	1
	when the other shocker was revealed, my reaction was 'so what'.	1
	i enjoyed the cliff-hanger chapter endings in angels & demons and the da vinci code, but they quickly became annoying in 'the lost symbol'.	1
	worse, much of the book felt like padding.	1
	the last 50 or so pages was like an infomercial -- the story is over, but wait, there's more!	1
	i kept hoping the book would have an interesting conclusion, but it ended with a wimper, not a bang.      	1
	previously successful formula gone bad.i was very excited when i saw that this book would be available for my kindle.	1
	i'd be able to download it as soon as it was released, and i wouldn't have to wait in line at a bookstore or wait several days for deliverly like all of the suckers without a kindle.	1
	that was the plan, but i learned my lesson.	1
	i would have saved myself a lot of pain if i had waited for the reviews to pour in.	1
	what does one expect from a dan brown book?	1
	an ominious conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, a search for a mcguffin that requires the decoding of obscure clues, and a convoluted plot that ties all of these elements together.	1
	one doesn't expect good writing, but in the davinci code and angels and demons, the books strengths were enough to overcome mr. brown's weak writing.	1
	for the first few chapters, the lost symbol seemed as if it would be equally successful.	1
	however, as the pages wore on, it became apparent that much was missing.	1
	the conspiracy seemed more pathetic than ominous.	1
	in view of what has been happening in washington d.c. recently, the threat to end the world as we know it seemed like it would be met with a shrug rather than a look of horror.	1
	and the villain, while certainly relentless, was driven only by irrational 'roid rage.	1
	the biggest disappointment was the revelation of the mcguffin after all of the clues had been decoded.	1
	robert langdon, the expert on symbols who is the book's primary protagonist, could have discovered it by simply checking into his hotel, thereby saving himself and the rest of us a lot of time and effort.	1
	when you reach the climax of the book (which puts an exclamation point on the irrationality of the villain), you will notice that there are quite a few pages remaining.	1
	mr. brown has managed to stuff those pages with religous apologetics and pseudo-scientific nonsense, and even masochists who were willing to read john galt's monologue in atlas shrugged in it's entirety will not be able to bear the finale of the lost symbol.	1
	the entire book is full of the stench of pseudo-science, and robert langdon was put into the role of skeptic.	1
	in addition to the many incidents of idiotic decisions made by langdon and the other protaganists throughout the book, langdon has to be the most ineffective skeptic in the history of the world.	1
	as the book's proponents of pseudo-science babble on, any reader will be virtually begging langdon to ask the right question or raise the right objection, but there is no hope.	1
	langdon is the ultimate in gullability.	1
	everybody has read versions of the religious apologetics that appear at the end of the book hundreds of time.	1
	but there is something new there.	1
	the conclusion of the apologetics is different from normal, and it will certainly be confusing to many christians where the arguments went off the track.	1
	the characters were relieved at the end of the story - finally, there is hope in the world.	1
	i was relieved as well as soon as i pressed the delete button.      	1
	just like ralphie's secret decoder.do you remember the scene in 'a christmas story' when ralphie anxiously deciphers his secret message with his little orphan annie secret decoder and all he comes up with is 'eat more ovaltine?'	1
	i feel his pain.	1
	listen to the abridges version or skip this one entirely.i listened to the unabridged audio version and i must say, this was an excruciating experience, especially the hour and a half after the very predictable climax and denouement had been reached.	1
	other reviewers have pointed out the wearisome repetitiveness and unnecessary summations throughout the book.	1
	except for the method of 'death/resurrection' of one of the characters, the 'unexpected twists' have all been used before in better novels.	1
	i have no doubt this will be made into a movie, but predict it will be panned even more than the da vinci code.	1
	three redeeming features of this book: the insights into masonry, d.c. architecture, and noetic science.	1
	instead of reading this book, pick one on any of these three topics and you will have spent your time more wisely and enjoyably.       	1
	brown covers up the book's flaws...until the end.the ending sucked.	1
	sorry to be so abrupt, but i appreciate that this is a long review, and i appreciate that you might not finish it, and unlike some other book reviewers, i can't, in good conscience, discuss the lost symbol without bringing up the end.	1
	that's unfortunate for dan brown because the first 450 pages of his new thriller were a ton of fun.	1
	they were filled with all the elements that brown fans (myself included) have come to love and expect: cryptic puzzles, fast-moving aircrafts, and dull historical locations made exciting.	1
	but the ending sucked.	1
	or maybe it only seemed like it sucked; maybe if robert langdon, the seemingly omniscient professor protagonist from angels & demons and the da vinci code were to read the lost symbol and peel back its layers, he'd discover that brown didn't drop the ball at the book's end; he covered up the book's flaws until then.	1
	but they had to come out sooner or later.	1
	yes, professor of symbology rober langdon's is back, and he's still solving puzzles, and his dialogue is still stiffer than the washington monument: 'this idea that there exists some kind of ancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power...i simply can't take it seriously.'	1
	but the dialogue is par for the course--'the course' encompassing not only brown's earlier works, but also the genre in which he writes.	1
	as flat as langdon's words sound, the professor has actually grown more human/less godlike in the past five years; it now takes him more than, oh, four seconds to solve a nearly impossible riddle.	1
	langdon's external life too has changed too, since his days running through he louvre: 'ever since his experiences in europe over the last several years, langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nutcases...grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the holy grail--perhaps even its location.'	1
	it doesn't take a harvard professor to see that brown is talking about himself there.	1
	ditto for this exchange between professor langdon and one of his readers: 'my book group read your book about the sacred feminine and the church!	1
	what a delicious scandal that one caused!	1
	you do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!'	1
	langdon smiled.	1
	'scandal wasn't really my intention.'	1
	unlike the da vinci code, the lost symbol won't ruffle feathers, let alone cause a 'delicious scandal.'	1
	the book's featured secret society, the freemasons, are politically benign.	1
	(sure, some individual masons hold political power, but their society membership is unconnected, substantively, to their politics.)	1
	apparently brown's new villain, a transformation-obsessed tattooed bodybuilder named mal'akh, didn't get the memo--he believes the masons are withholding the secrets to the universe from the rest of mankind.	1
	the lost symbol's plot kicks off when mal'akh kidnaps professor langdon's friend peter.	1
	mal'ach tells langdon he'll free peter once he (langdon) solves the freemason's puzzles and discovers their secrets.	1
	so langdon and peter's sister katherine (a 'noetics scientist' [i.e., a person who's convinced herself that psychokinesis is a legitimate science and tries to convince others of the same {and probably will convince brown's less skeptical readers, given 1) the authority with which she speaks and 2) the reverence her brother peter and, disappointingly, professor langdon afford her}]) run around washington dc trying to solve masonic puzzles.	1
	except for when they're trying not to solve them.	1
	see, peter (the guy langdon is trying to rescue) told langdon not to unlock the mysteries of the freemasons, and langdon wants desperately to respect his friend's wishes, and langdon's ambivalence severely cuts into the book's momentum.	1
	for example, look to this dialogue between professor langson and katherine: 'he stood poised, pencil in hand, and yet...strangely, after all this enthusiasm, he seemed to hesitate.	1
	`robert?'	1
	he turned to her, his expression one of trepidation.	1
	`are you sure we want to do this?	1
	peter expressly--` `robert, if you don't want to decipher this engraving, then i will.''	1
	the thing that keeps the lost symbol moving along is brown's implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered (like the one in da vinci code about jesus having a kid).	1
	langdon keeps asking, are you sure we're not speaking in metaphors here?	1
	are you sure we're dealing with something tangible?, and everybody (peter, mal'ach, the cia) keeps assuring him, no metaphors here; we're being literal.	1
	quasi-spoiler alert: langdon's suspicions were well founded.	1
	on a similar note, for a couple hundred pages, mal'akh and the cia insist the stakes couldn't be higher, so langdon (along with the reader) is led to believe that if he (langdon) doesn't solve the freemasons puzzles, the world as we know will crumble to pieces for some reason or other.	1
	(or is it that will the world crumble if he does solve them?	1
	one of the two.)	1
	turns out the potential danger in question is something that could be fixed by a focused pr campaign.	1
	when brown got to the end of the story, i suspect he thought to himself oops!	1
	i haven't made the stakes high enough and i haven't revealed a tangible secret.	1
	i've got to throw in something that will rival da vinci code in scope.	1
	and then, in an attempt to artificially raise the stakes, brown throws a hail mary pass in the form of a platonic dialogue about the nature of god.	1
	it comes off as ham-fisted and borderline preachy.	1
	i said that i enjoyed the book's first 450 pages, and i did.	1
	at the time.	1
	but the book left a bitter taste in my mouth that grows bitterer and bitterer as time goes by.	1
	so here's what i recommend: buy a copy of the lost symbol, read the first 450 pages, and then throw the book away.	1
	yes, you could try to think up your own satisfying ending, but if brown couldn't think of one--and believe me, he couldn't--the odds are against you.	1
	no offense.	1
	i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news--believe me, i wanted to like this one too.       	1
	who'd have thought dan brown can be a bore?.the best thing i can say about 'the lost symbol' is that it made me want to visit the u.s. capital and see all its architectural treasures for myself.	1
	apart from that, i found the book incredibly boring.	1
	this time, our brilliant harvard symbologist robert langdon immerses himself in the world of freemasonry.	1
	a mysterious villain has kidnapped his langdon's friend, a high-ranking mason, and blackmails langdon into taking up the search for a mysterious pyramid for him, on which there is a (mysterious) map to be found, which in turn is supposed to lead to the (even more mysterious) location of the (most mysterious of all) 'ancient mysteries'.	1
	these are badly needed by the villain, it seems, because he expects them to help him complete his transformation into an all-powerful demon.	1
	right.	1
	next, the mysterious director of a mysterious cia branch steps on the scene.	1
	she's prepared to give the villain what he wants, even to sacrifice the lives of langdon's friend and even langdon himself.	1
	the reason is supposedly that there is much more at stake than just the mysteries of freemasonry and a few people's lives - there is, in fact (drum roll) a mysterious national security crisis!	1
	trouble is, this supposed national security crisis is so mysterious that the reader doesn't learn until very late in the book what it is.	1
	dan brown is completely disregarding the first principle of creating suspense here - the reader has to know what's at stake.	1
	of course, he might have a very good reason for doing it that way, because when we finally learn what's up with this 'crisis', it turns out to be a damp squib.	1
	it doesn't amount to much more than a semi-serious pr crisis, really.	1
	of course, there may have been a very good reason for brown to do it that way.	1
	if that was all that he was able to come up with, maybe putting off this disclosure as long as possible was indeed his best bet.	1
	speaking of disclosure: of course, there's again the dan brown surprising twist(tm) on page 448. only unfortunately it doesn't come surprising to anyone anymore by that time, because we've been seeing it coming since page 221. the same problem is affecting the puzzles, usually one of the most entertaining aspects in brown's novels.	1
	this time, though, they are so disarmingly simple that the question why langdon takes so long to solve them (and why a brilliant harvard symbologist is needed for them anyway) is the most puzzling thing about them.	1
	some of the solutions veritably jump in your face, and then you have to drag yourself through a dozen more pages until langdon finally gets it, too.	1
	maybe the professor should start thinking about retirement.	1
	the book's biggest fault, though, is that it is made entirely of mcguffins - empty clichs that do their job as elements of suspense only as long as no one thinks too hard about what they actually are, like that famous briefcase everyone is after in hitchcock's '39 steps'.	1
	in 'the lost symbol', though, we go from one mcguffin to the next without ever getting to see what's in the briefcase, as it were.	1
	that would be impossible, of course, because there's nothing in it.	1
	not until the very end, when everything's over really, does brown find it necessary to have his hero and heroine stir around in the thin mystical-philosophical soup of 'tapping the unused potential of the human mind', which is supposed to be the essence of the 'ancient mysteries' - just another empty clich.	1
	by that time, of course, the reader is so befuddled with boredom that chances are they'll never ask themselves what was the big secret about this groundbreaking revelation in the first place.	1
	'angels and demons' was a highly entertaining, intelligent thriller.	1
	'the da vinci code' was a bit silly, but if you kept one eye shut and pretended to know nothing about church history, it was a fairly suspenseful yarn at least.	1
	but 'the lost symbol' is leagues beneath both these books.	1
	who'd have thought dan brown can be a bore?      	1
	forgettable page-turner; ideal for a transpacific flight.the lost symbol is an engaging page turner, as long as you don't think too much as you read.	1
	brown's grasp of history is reasonably, but neither deep nor insightful.	1
	the plot is exactly as you'd expect, with entertaining plot twists roughly where you'd expect them.	1
	still, the book is enjoyable and a light read.	1
	the kindle edition sells for roughly the same price as a theater ticket to a summer blockbuster.	1
	while the forgettable blockbuster will entertain you for two hours, brown's book will probably take you more than ten hours to read.	1
	on that basis alone, the book is a good value.	1
	for people who prefer some depth to their literary entertainment, consider neal stephenson, a master of esoteric science fiction.	1
	either  or  provide an excellent introduction to his multi-layered work.	1
	if you prefer to discover real secrets, consider the excellent .	1
	finally, umberto eco's  is one of the greatest conspiracy novels of all time.      	1
	a poor shadow of 'the da vinci code'.now, if you've read any of dan brown's prior works (such as 'angels and demons', or his better known 'the da vinci code'), you know that you're not exactly expecting a masterpiece.	1
	like 'the da vinci code', 'the lost symbol' is a heavily plot-driven page-turner chock-full of whatever mysterious secretive thing dan brown happened to be fascinated by when he was writing his novel (in this case freemasonry).	1
	it centers around robert langdon, the protagonist from the prior two novels (who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations), who, with the standard pretty female sidekick (another 'scientist', if you can call noetic pseudoscience a 'science'), explores a mystery in washington d.c. while being pursued by the authorities and dealing with your friendly large fanatic character (like silas from 'the da vinci code').	1
	the problem is that this book, unlike the 'da vinci code', is just not particularly fun to read.	1
	the brown formula for chapter writing is omnipresent (basically, have langdon talk about something, have a realization, and end with a 'what the .	1
	.	1
	.'	1
	chapter cliff-hanger), and the book is too long - by the time it finally reaches the conclusion, your reaction isn't 'well, that's interesting'; it's 'finally!	1
	is it over?'.	1
	it doesn't help that brown goes over-board on exposition on freemasonry and noetic science (or rather, his beliefs about both- brown's 'facts' usually don't correspond to reality) even by his standards, and adds a healthy dose of pseudoscience (which is actually new for him - 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code' were both physically possible, even if you thought the plots were improbable).	1
	i strongly, strongly suggest you avoid buying this book, or reading it.	1
	but if you can't resist, do yourself a favor and wait till you can get it in the library.       	1
	really?.as someone who enjoyed the da vinci code and angels and demons, i'd just like to say the following: dear reader:    wait for the paperback....really!!!	1
	you know how some authors write some enjoyable novels that make a fortune then throw out some mediocre fluff because they know with their name on the cover it will fly off the shelf?	1
	well, it happened again.	1
	really!signed,wasted anticipation and money  dear dan brown:   six years of waiting for this?	1
	really!	1
	here's what i think happened...you had a contract to get a new novel out this year but you spent the last 5 1/2 years enjoying yourself with all the money you made...okay, you earned it...enjoy!	1
	but wait, now you have to hustle and get a novel to the publisher.	1
	no problem, you think as you take out the outline for the previous books.	1
	instead of the grail, you'll make it some 'lost symbol' mainly because you're at a lose as to how you're going to meet that deadline.	1
	for the female role, you'll turn her into a scientist in some unknown field.	1
	just so you can have another female star in the movie, you'll throw in a cia agent.	1
	instead the crazy priest, you'll make that role just a plain psycho that another hollywood hunk can play.	1
	you'll go through the motions but this time langford won't be as sharp as before which makes sense because you aren't either.	1
	instead of the catholic church, you'll use the masons because you can google masons and get all kinds of alledged secrets and mysteries as you sit by the pool and sip on some expensive scotch.	1
	you'll use washington dc because, like the masons, it's easy to google and maybe you've seen national treasure.	1
	okay, that takes care of the first 2/3 of the book.	1
	you're almost there and you can see the money rolling in so you just wrap up the whole package with your optimism and hope that you can pull it off.	1
	well, congratulations.	1
	it worked and i was amoung the million that were suckered on the 15th.	1
	i give you one star for the book and one star for the balls.	1
	i hope you enjoy my money but, mr. brown, please know that i don't believe you earned it and i don't think even you do.	1
	really.	1
	signed,disappointed	1
	terrible and disappointing...gets more and more stupid the more you read..dan brown and the publishers should be embarrassed...this was one of the stupidest and frankly disappointing books i've ever read.	1
	don't waste your money.	1
	i don't normally write reviews on amazon, but i was so disappointed and upset at how bad this book was that i felt compelled to write one (note: a couple of spoilers in here, so if you do want to waste your money and read this book anyway, be aware that i have to mention a few points in here).	1
	the book was completely over-hyped, and it feels like i've wasted hours and hours of my time having read it.	1
	can i request a refund?	1
	dan brown's previous books have been riveting and well thought out...this one was not.	1
	it starts out with mysterious teasers to get you hooked, but you only keep reading with the hope that it will get better, and have some kind of twist or other excitement....but it doesn't get any better.	1
	in fact, it gets progressively worse, with the quarter of the book being simply idiotic.	1
	the ending is about as lame and disappointing as it could be (and was frankly a cop out).	1
	if i had known how stupid the ending was, i would have stopped reading mid-way through.	1
	the characters are all complete caricatures (e.g., an evil genius who tattoos his entire body by himself, but covers himself with makeup that nobody can detect, except to think it's an artificial tan), and they completely  unsympathetic.	1
	these supposedly 'brilliant' characters take some of the stupidest actions ever...almost as if they are characters in a teen horror flick, and not the supposedly educated people they are described as...such as a harvard professor, the head of the smithsonian, very senior cia officer, etc).	1
	the 'scientific' aspects are also unbelievable....come on - a isolation chamber filled with super oxygenated fluid that you can breathe?	1
	and having spent hours 'dead' in this fluid, langdon can still run around afterwards like a superhero and 'solve' the 'hidden mystery'?	1
	or the heroine being drained of almost all her blood, but being quickly resuscitated and then able to join langdon in his frantic search (rather than being taken to a hospital emergency room)?	1
	and how about a holographic computer memory containing a person's entire life work of scientific research, but she didn't think to make a back up copy of her own?	1
	dan brown found some interesting tidbits about masonic lore, and tied them together with a loose plot about 'ancient mysteries', and tried to make it compelling to the reader by 'revealing' some 'profound secrets' to the characters at the end of a chapter, but without telling the reader what the secret is (and that it supposed to make it a compelling 'mystery'??).	1
	as a plot device, someone in a high school creative writing class could do better.	1
	don't waste your time and money and find something else to read.	1
	disappointment, followed by anger..there are not enough words to say how angry this book made me, especially the ending.	1
	after 400 pages of moderately entertaining, boilerplate, dan brown thriller, i was served an ending that is so disappointing it will forever be the ending against which i judge all bad endings.	1
	i felt cheated.	1
	i was disappointed and upset.	1
	but most of all, i was angry.	1
	angry at dan brown for writing it, angry at his publisher for publishing it, and most of all, angry at myself for wasting a beautiful fall evening setting myself up to get disappointed by it.	1
	spare yourself.	1
	life is too short.      	1
	entertaining, but not quite.once again dan brown serves up his action-filled mix of mysticism and science as symbologist robert langdon tracks down the evil-doer who has kidnapped his friend and mentor peter solomon, leader of the masons in washington, dc.	1
	this time langdon's quest is on american soil and instead of the catholic church the secret institution is the order of masons.	1
	we learn how the nation's capital is filled with mystical symbols and sacred buildings.	1
	the action is fast-paced and i look forward to seeing the film with tom hanks.	1
	but this book has a few flaws.	1
	for one thing, the cia is involved because of a potential revelation that could have catastrophic implications for national security.	1
	only when the secret is revealed, it just isn't that terrible.	1
	the nation and the world could survive just fine.	1
	but the whole book centers around the cia story, which just seems a bit silly in the end.	1
	the masons are treated extremely well, much better than the catholic church in previous dan brown books.	1
	not only do they come across as benign and much misunderstood, with many masons being involved in the founding of the united states and washington, dc itself, and continuing to hold positions of power today.	1
	but the key masons in the story are constantly lecturing to robert langdon, telling our hero the truth.	1
	langdon doesn't really uncover a secret, the masons just tell him.	1
	when the big secret is uncovered, the masons already knew.	1
	worst of all, when the action-packed climax has happened, the final chapters, when the secrets of the ancient mysteries are revealed to us, are just plain boring, as are those hidden truths.	1
	one nice message for americans out of touch with their country's history, is how the founding fathers were deists rather than christians.	1
	this might come as a considerable surprise to fundamentalist christians today, along with this book's basic message that all religions lead to the same divinity, which is in us all.	1
	and that science is a tool for discovering the divinity within us.	1
	brown's message is one many fundamentalists around the world need to hear.	1
	hopefully in following the face-paced action, they will also hear the message.       	1
	just not worth the effort .	1
	.	1
	..what can i say that hasn't already been said?	1
	i purchased this book on the day of its release and began reading immediately.	1
	i don't dive into thrillers expecting great literature, but i do expect the writer to have some command over the language.	1
	although i enjoyed 'the da vinci code,' i found the writing distractingly bad.	1
	'the lost symbol,' unfortunately, doesn't even have the fun plot going for it.	1
	in 'the da vinci code,' robert langdon pursued a secret with the potential to destroy the catholic church and wipe out thousands of years of religious doctrine.	1
	this gave dvc a wonderful sense of tension that kept you turning the pages.	1
	in 'the lost symbol,' langdon's quest revolves around a secret kept under wraps by the free masons for hundres of years.	1
	unfortunately, it fails to generate any excitement.	1
	in addition, the characters in this book seem to suffer from a total lack of common sense: why would langdon fly to washington d.c. at a friend's request without actually speaking to said friend?	1
	why would he bring with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs?	1
	why, after katherine calls 9-1-1 and gives the address where her kidnapped brother is being held hostage by a raving psychotic, do authorities send a simple security guard to investigate .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	and why is it the police never bother showing up at the address?	1
	why would katherine allow a man she's met only once into her 'top secret' laboratory?	1
	reading the book, you'll undoubtedly find yourself asking many of the same questions.	1
	you'll also guess the bad guy's true identity as soon as you learn his backstory.	1
	what i found most annoying about the book, however, was brown's need to spoon-feed the reader every detail.	1
	in one scene, langdon is trapped inside a crate that's attached to a plastic chute.	1
	water starts coursing down the chute and into the crate, prompting another character in the room to think, 'he's pumping water into the crate!'	1
	yes, dan, we get it.	1
	thanks!	1
	he does this repeatedly.	1
	it made me want to scream.	1
	the writing could have improved ten-fold with a strong editor.	1
	i enjoyed 'da vinci,' but couldn't get through 'angels and demons.'	1
	i finished 'the lost symbol,' but found the going painful.	1
	this is definitely my last dan brown.      	1
	save your money.i thought this book was awful, and i don't say that simply because of dan brown's writing style or because of the flat, predictable story line.	1
	i say it because it simply just a terrible book.	1
	the characters are underdeveloped (which is quite a feat given the book is 528 pages long) and cliched, the plot meanders aimlessly for pages at a time, and the book is filled with entire throwaway chapters.	1
	however, the worst part is to trudge all the way through it and find the ending is a complete and utter disappointment.	1
	i have never felt dan brown was a stellar author, but both a&d; and dvc were at least entertaining and interesting.	1
	but it was an absolute chore to finish reading this book; no wonder it took over 6 years to write.        	1
	wow, how lame was that ending?	1
	- but it was still pretty entertaining for the first 450 pages or so.like many people, i found this book to be pretty entertaining most of the way through but was disappointed by the lame ending.	1
	of the five dan brown novels, this is the forth best (better than digital fortress but weaker than the others).	1
	brown is not a great writer (even his most ardent fans will acknowledge this i think).	1
	the plot is formulaic, the characters are flat, & the dialogue ranges from clunky to laughable.	1
	but, despite his shortcomings, few people can write a page-turner like dan brown.	1
	despite myself, i enjoyed the lost symbol (until the previously mentioned - lame ending).	1
	"it is worth noting though, that even if the ending hadn't been as lame as it was, the lost symbol still would have fallen short of the other langdon novels because: 1.	the lone bad guy isn't nearly as compelling a villain as the multi-pronged reach of the catholic church from earlier novels.2."	1
	brown seems to be trying too hard not to offend anyone this time out and it results in some awkward dialogue to ensure conventional religion, new age philosophies, and the masons get presented in a fair and balanced manner.	1
	he seems to be desperately trying to avoid controversy.	1
	"3.	the science (using the term loosely) of noetics isn't really integrated effectively into the plot."	1
	its inclusion into the story is to provide a spring-board for characters to discuss new age philosophies, particularly during the unnecessary final 40 or so pages of the novel (aka - the lame ending) science and religion are combined much more effectively in a&d.;4.	1
	it might only be me but... the european locations, art and history, and the christianity based story-lines of da vinci and a&d; were so much more fascinating than washington dc and the masons.5.	1
	the big twist near the end (re the identity of the tattooed man) is so obvious it's ridiculous.	1
	there are very few genuine surprises in this novel.	1
	the real let-down though is the massive disappointment of the ending.	1
	the secrets, when revealed in the other books, paid off.	1
	this is not the case in the lost symbol and this is an important factor because the previous 500 or so pages lead up to finding out what that secret is.	1
	if it falls short, even if you found yourself enjoying the novel to that point, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.	1
	i won't divulge anything, but trust me - it's lame.	1
	the bottom line:  brown may be a formulaic writer but he's good at what he does and he weaves some interesting historical trivia into a thriller that moves along at a relentless pace.	1
	if you liked the previous brown novels you'll probably find this one to be a little weaker than the others, but overall pretty entertaining - that is until you get to the end.	1
	you will then groan in frustration and wonder whether you should have bothered reading it at all.  	1
	great first 2 quarters, highly disappointing after half time..after enjoying all of brown's books and almost 3/4's of this one, i was amazed that a gifted storyteller could throw all his sub-plots into a blender and puree every one of them.	1
	dan brown is not shakespeare nor do i expect great literature from him, but i usually get alternative takes on historic facts, scavenger-hunt-esque adventure and a thought provoking ending albeit through his tried and true formula of mentor/friend really being the bad guy.	1
	(the rest is spoiler coming if you haven't read the book yet).	1
	so, i was highly relieved that peter solomon was not really 'in on it' .	1
	yet as predictable as that would have been for brown, it was less predictable than who the bad guy really was.	1
	did anybody not see that coming?	1
	and that is just the first of so many let downs.	1
	i'm racking my brain why the cia (and not the fbi) was involved due to the national security implications.	1
	so, as an avid try-to-guess-what's-coming-reader, i assume katherine's research into how group thought(prayer)can affect events and cia involvement and ma'lach's determination to destroy all her research...i'm thinking he will somehow cause the whole world to think about some awful thing, say nuclear annihilation or world wide plague or forcing everyone to read this book.	1
	but the intriguing twists noetic science could have produced never materialized.	1
	katherine could have worked at a 7-11 and the plot would not have been affected.	1
	the government involvement was actually laughable.	1
	since when is a politician caught on tape doing something morally reprehensible a crisis of utmost importance?	1
	has brown been living on a deserted island the last six years?	1
	when the architect was shocked into cooperation, i suspected piles of bloody bodies that were a sign of things to come from the villain.	1
	but it was a handful of politicians in their mason regalia performing initiations?	1
	how many governors, senators, presidents have we caught in far more compromising situations?	1
	most are still in office.	1
	but most disappointing is the end after the end.	1
	ok, langdon ran all over town decoding this and that and told us alot about art and ancient mysteries which is what i enjoy.	1
	he made several references to king solomon, yet there's no connection to the solomon family who was entrusted with the pyramid?	1
	the masons knew where the 'treasure' was the whole time?	1
	what was the point in the secret pyramid and capstone?	1
	the most obvious place where it could be is where it really is?	1
	it's not really a bunch of informative scrolls passed down through the ages that tell us people really can make things happen just by thinking about it.	1
	come on, it's the bible?	1
	did the catholic church sue brown and this is his punishment?	1
	brown had so many potential plot twists and ways to tie everything together and he didn't.	1
	i felt as if he wrote down ideas that came to him on little scraps of paper and pasted them all together.	1
	i wouldn't have been so disappointed if someone else had wrote this book.        	1
	(spoiler alert) what a lame ending.let me save you some money and time: o the lost symbol is an old bible hidden in a cornerstone buried under the washington monument.	1
	people are chasing around and dying for that?	1
	o the cia wants to stop a hidden camera video of a secret meeting of the masons from being sent to the internet and 'bringing down the country'.	1
	o the villain 'mal'akh' is zach, peter solomon's estranged son.	1
	the book starts off fairly well with suspense and mystery.	1
	the legends and stories of the founding fathers, d.c. and the masons are put forth in a very interesting and entertaining way - however - as i mentioned at the beginning of my review, the lame ending of these two plot points have a very disappointing resolution.	1
	brown builds up the suspense and all we get is  something so bland and dumb, that all i wanted to say was: 'so what?'	1
	(cue the mile davis song).	1
	why all the elaborate codes and misdirection to prevent the discovery of an old bible sealed away in a cornerstone of a national monument that nobody is going (or could if they wanted) to dig up anyway?	1
	why would the cia care if some masons initiation ritual is posted on the internet, no matter which important government bigwigs are involved?	1
	bring down the government?	1
	hardly.	1
	that can be controlled and countered in so many ways i can't even begin to count them.	1
	who would care anyway?	1
	just invent another 'balloon boy' and all the ruckus about masons would be instantly forgotten.	1
	the last 90 minutes or so is just a long boring epilogue with sophmoric philosophizing about sky faeries and hope.	1
	to use an old 80's expression, 'gag me with a spoon'.	1
	what a letdown.	1
	i'm just glad i didn't pay anything for this book since i got it from my library.	1
	if you have to check out this train wreck for yourself, i'd suggest you do the same and not waste good money on this tripe.	1
	until i read the ending i would have rated this a 3 or 4. after i read the ending it only rates a 1, and that would be generous.      	1
	not worthy of langdon.i loved angels and demons and greatly enjoyed the davinci code.	1
	this is more on the level of deception point (another book which demonstrated a total ignorance of the real world and how washington works).	1
	the book starts with an improbable beginning, throws in a stereotypical security officer (wow, a dragon lady, that is orginial), mixes in some nebulous pseudo-science and then goes masonic on us.	1
	i found the locations interesting, but the characters are cardboard.	1
	the only character that actually interested me dies, and even that didn't engage me.	1
	in the prior langdon books i knew something about what was at stake (the papacy/the vatican, the holy grail) but here i had no idea, other than single rich and powerful man with a tragic life, his sister, and mysterious claims of national security and some ominous secret.	1
	it really didn't keep me wanting more.	1
	one of brown's themes, which he ends the book on, is the power of hope.	1
	it was hope that drove me to finish the book, a hope that it would redeem itself.	1
	i guess i need to save up my remaining hope for his next book (if i have enough left by then).        	1
	disappointing.quick quiz - what's common between dvc, a&d; and the lost symbol?	1
	i'll tell ya -  1) an unstoppable invincible twisted mercenary who is bigger, badder, smarter and more powerful than than 10 delta force squads put together.	1
	but then just doesn't have enough smarts to outdo langdon & co. in the end.	1
	2) a super smart woman turned damsel-in-distress turned langdon sidekick 3) a super rich and influential male who is langdon's confidant, soundboard and source of superior knowledge.	1
	and of course is inevitably kidnapped or targetted by #1.	1
	4) a confident yet confused langdon who is in 'surely dead' situations but pulls a james bond everytime.	1
	and of course he's an encylopedia of knowledge of everything - from the tip of your finger nails to the 4th brick in the right wall of your neighbourhood church.	1
	and yet, he always requires 2 rounds to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious  and turns out to be not right, and then he has an omg moment to figure out the 'real' meaning.	1
	5) and finally, paintings, pyramids, talismans - clues which are built up to have the greatest if not the most earth shattering conclusions turn out to be a little whiff of nothing.	1
	and make you go..really?	1
	(well dvc wasn;t that bad i admit)  why do i still read i ask?	1
	it's like bad music - you listen to it enough and you'll start humming it.	1
	final conclusion in two words - skip it.	1
	ps.	1
	the secret is in it.      	1
	and if i could i would have given it zero stars.i want to start off my review by saying that i enjoyed a&d; and dvc.	1
	i know that dan brown is not a literary genius, but i read thrillers to be entertained and his books are quick, page-turning reads.	1
	that being said, this is the worst book i have ever read.	1
	i waited a few days to write a review because i thought i might have been so disappointed due to the book not living up to all the 'hype', but no this is just plain old garbage.	1
	here are a few of the problems i had with it:1) when i read thrillers i relax and read without seriously trying to predict what is going to happen.	1
	within the first few chapters of this book i had already correctly guessed where they were going to end up in the end.	1
	and as i continued reading, i saw many of the 'twists' coming.2) there are so many plot inaccuracies in this book it is an insult to the readers.	1
	i won't go into detail about them just in case anyone after reading these reviews still decides to read it (even thought it is not even worth it to read it for a laugh imo) but ugh!3) just like the dvc this book starts off slow, however it never really speeds up.	1
	there is just too much information given to us and at least half of it is not needed, it just bogs down the action.4) the pseudo-science in this book is just too much for me to take.	1
	if you have read the secret and liked that maybe you can take it but i just found it a cop-out and very disappointing.5) what i like about dan brown's books are that they could 'almost' be true.	1
	yes i know there is no way they could but in your mind you could almost imagine it happening.	1
	that's what made it fun, wanting to look up a picture of the last supper and all the other little 'facts' in the books.	1
	this book has none of that drive, which is ironic considering how much information is thrown at you in the book.6) the ending is so cheesy i am embarrassed for dan brown.	1
	again i won't go into it in case you are still thinking about reading it.so to sum it up: if you are thinking about reading this book because you liked a&d; and/or dvc don't bother.	1
	it is a watered down mess that i can't believe took 6 years to make.      	1
	a trivia book disguised as a thriller.nobody in this book does anything that remotely resembles how people really behave.	1
	for example, hours after the cia learns that a powerful man has been kidnapped, they haven't contacted his closest family member or traced his cellphone, which the kidnapper is sending text messages from.	1
	that sort of sloppiness lends itself to keeping the plot moving, but requires you leave your brain at the door.	1
	and you'd think the author got paid by the adverb.	1
	every action is punctuated by a 'breathlessly', 'angrily', 'eerily' or the like.	1
	it's like he's afraid that we won't.	1
	get.	1
	how.	1
	important.	1
	this.	1
	is.	1
	on the other hand, the book serves as an interesting trivia guide as each major plot point is a chance for the main character, robert langdon, to remember a lecture he's given related to that plot point--the history of the freemasons, the creation of the u.s. capitol building, famous masons through history, etc.	1
	other characters get their moments to muse on their area of expertise--the library of congress, noetics, computer hacking.	1
	then there are the points where they lecture each other as langdon deciphers puzzles.	1
	unfortunately, these lectures come across more as essays on a topic that stopped the silly plot dead in its tracks repeatedly.	1
	i put it down more than once, and eventually skimmed the back half, stopping at the subjects that interested me.	1
	in the end, though, i found myself wondering whether even that was worth the time spent.	1
	let the lone star above serve as my answer (he exclaimed breathlessly)      	1
	this took six years?.when you pick up a dan brown book, you realize it will be far from great literature.	1
	at best you hope for some good action scenes and a mystery that is fairly interesting to learn about.	1
	lets face it, dan brown is umberto eco dumbed down to the common denominator.	1
	but who really cares, it is entertaining.	1
	sadly the lost symbol drags with a certain amount of sameness as his other langdon stories.	1
	here is poor hapless robert langdon, running from the cops, with the help of a brilliant female lead, directed by an older brilliant man, being chased by overdone psychopath.	1
	and sadly, the quality of the writing is about as high as my previous sentence.	1
	angels and demons began the formula, da vinci code rose above it with very interesting subject matter, lost symbol just wallows in sameness.	1
	it is not without its pleasures, one particular action scene taking place in a pitch black chamber stands out as one of the best, but you have pretty much already read this book.	1
	i'm not going to stop anyone from reading this, nor would i particularly want to.	1
	but six years worth of hype leaves this book feeling extremely flat.	1
	its probably time to retire langdon while he is ahead.      	1
	excruciating..have you ever had that burning sensation in your chest?	1
	no, not heart-burn.	1
	more deadly (if possible) than that.	1
	i mean the feeling when you are reading a novel, watching a movie, or playing a video game and you get so impatient for it to move along.	1
	you start clenching your jaw.	1
	you crack your knuckles again, even though you just cracked them two minutes earlier.	1
	the feeling that is the perfect mix of annoyance and impatience burns in you.	1
	that's what reading the lost symbol is like.	1
	it is excruciating.	1
	yes.	1
	excruciating...that is the word of choice to explain dan brown's latest 'novel.'	1
	(dear dan brown: thank you for kindly putting the words, 'a novel' on the front cover of your book.	1
	without them, i would have mistaken this book for a slush-pile reject.)	1
	what a terrible, terrible book.	1
	six years ago, dan brown caused all sorts of controversy with his novel the da vinci code.	1
	it sold a bajillion copies, and forced the whole 'religious conspiracy' sub-genre into focus.	1
	it was also a really poorly written novel.	1
	i have read all of dan brown's work.	1
	from digital fortress to the newly printed the lost symbol, dan brown manages to do one thing with remarkable consistency: become a worse writer with each novel.	1
	don't worry, this novel is totally different from the prior two langdon novels.	1
	see, langdon goes to a famous national building, and receives a cryptic phone call about how he needs to solve a mystery that only langdon can solve!	1
	he then discovers a bloody clue in the middle of the building.	1
	following a train of interweaving clues about the freemasons, langdon is joined by his lovely female companion, kathleen, as they chase--or are they chased by?--the eeeeeevil mal'akh.	1
	what they discover will change everything!	1
	nothing is as it seems... oh wait.	1
	everything is exactly as it seems, because this is the same plot at angels & demons and the da vinci code.	1
	america: what is wrong with you?	1
	robert langdon.	1
	he marveled us with his professorial skills in, what i consider the only enjoyable langdon book, angels & demons.	1
	a lot has changed since that novel.	1
	in the lost symbol, langdon--in his third 'adventure'--has managed to become dense and narrow-minded.	1
	he seems incapable of putting his famed intellect to use during the novel, and is relegated to responding to any question or situation with a bewildered, 'what?!'	1
	now before you ask, yes, the '?!'	1
	is actually used in the novel at least two or three times per chapter (there are 133 chapters...you do the math).	1
	if you have to use more than one punctuation type at the end of a sentence, the only thing you are showing the reader is that you have no real writing ability.	1
	young writers take note.	1
	amidst the endless repetitive descriptions, we as readers are made to suffer an endless stream of 'telling' instead of 'showing.'	1
	the few times brown manages to 'show' us what is going on, he immediately precedes or follows it by telling us the exactly same thing.	1
	it became so infuriating, that by chapter 9 i wanted to gouge my eyes out.	1
	to illustrate another example of formulaic writing that brown has become famous for, here is his dialogue formula: person 1: 'have you heard of [insert topic here]?	1
	'person 2: 'no, what is it?	1
	'person 1: '[insert poorly veiled information dump here]'person 2: 'i don't understand.	1
	'person 1: '[insert the exact same explanation for a second time]'person 2: 'so what you are saying is [insert 3rd identical explanation]'person 1: 'no, you aren't listening.	1
	what i said was [insert 4th explanation-100% identical to the previous 3 explanations]'person 2: 'ah, i see.	1
	'person 1: 'good.	1
	now have you heard of [insert topic here]?'	1
	repeat all steps for as many filler pages as needed.	1
	seriously.	1
	how about pacing?	1
	brown is known for his pacing isn't he?	1
	two things here.	1
	first, his pacing is false.	1
	in order to create this false sense of 'break-neck speed,' he ends each chapter on a cliff-hanger.	1
	i felt like there should have been a voice-over saying 'dun-dun-duuun' playing as you turned the last page of every chapter.	1
	when brown finally does manage to build up some sort of pace, he ruins it with a flashback.	1
	in a particularly boring flashback early on (in the first few chapters), langdon is rushing to give a speech (he only has three minutes to get there!	1
	), and he lapses into a flashback.	1
	in addition to bringing the pace to a screeching halt, we see, in an academic setting, that langdon is supposed to be insanely smart.	1
	so much better than everyone!	1
	his students believe and hang on every word, no matter how ridiculous.	1
	so, if he is so smart, why is he such an idiot later, and so slow on the uptake?	1
	why does he have to be told everything like he is a mentally deficient high-school student?	1
	the answer?	1
	dan brown's writing is so poor that this is the only way he knows how to express himself, and these sections serve as a vehicle for information dumps.	1
	it is also humorous that a security guard, early on in the story, makes the exact same observation of langdon.	1
	pro tip: if the characters you are writing think your main pov is stupid, so will the readers.	1
	this will undermine your work.	1
	logic flaws aside (if i stopped to mention all of them, i would be transcribing the full novel), and forgetting the pov switching problems, one of the main problems is the plethora of clichs.	1
	we have the super-secret division of the cia, and she is a four-foot tall asian woman with a superiority complex.	1
	and she is deformed.	1
	how about the damsel in distress that is the target of a hideously disfigured super-villain?	1
	yep, the lost symbol has that too.	1
	even james bond movies have finally moved beyond these clichs.	1
	i would be remiss if i didn't talk about the villain of the novel.	1
	never-mind that his big reveal at the end of the novel is telegraphed from the moment certain characters are introduced.	1
	i don't want to talk about that.	1
	i want to talk about this: how to build a clich villain the dan brown way1) fall for every trick that the dumb hero/heroine throws at you.2) after being outwitted somehow, point menacingly at the hero/heroine.3) if you can manage, be a religious fanatic of some sort.4) tell the hero/heroine all your secret plans and/or your secret past in a dramatic moment.5) think--at least 3 times early in the novel--that destiny is guiding you.	1
	feel free to think this up until the moment you are killed due to your stupidity (see point #8 below)6) make the hero/heroine think that they killed you years ago.	1
	it makes your entrance much more dramatic...especially when combined with point #4 above.7) when given the opportunity, study yourself naked in a body-length mirror.8) don't actually kill the hero/heroine when you have the chance.	1
	leave them to be discovered so they can come kill you later.	1
	be sure to act surprised later when they show up.9) have a super-secret lair within your home--preferably hidden by a secret door.	1
	however, the key element here is to leave obvious evidence for people to find so they can enter the lair and discover all your plans in case they didn't catch them in point #4 above.	1
	no, seriously, this all happens in the lost symbol.	1
	don't worry citizens, robert langdon is here to save the day.	1
	will he stun us with his intellect?	1
	of course not.	1
	he will however use his experiences from prior novels to solve everything with the trusty anagram.	1
	and when that fails, blind luck will do, as will an epiphany--nothing will trigger the epiphany other than brown deciding it is time to move the story along to the next idiotic conversation (see above formula).	1
	are you getting the drift here?	1
	dan brown's the lost symbol should never have been printed.	1
	the writing skill is sub-6th grade level, and his story is contrived and clich.	1
	an interesting observation: when you talk to most people who have read brown's robert langdon novels, they almost always like the first one they read most.	1
	why?	1
	because it is the same plot over and over again.	1
	it is like the mystery version of a harlequin romance novel.	1
	so, it shouldn't be any surprise that this third novel is even worse.	1
	it's the same novel...again!	1
	of course, when you stop to think about what the 'big problem' was that everyone in the novel was trying to prevent, you realize just how terrible the 'novel' is.	1
	so.	1
	absurd.	1
	don't read this book.	1
	ever.	1
	wait for the inevitable movie.	1
	it has no choice but to be better than the novel.	1
	if you really want to know about all the freemason stuff, go get a non-fiction book or two about them.	1
	they will be better paced, and more entertaining than the lost symbol.	1
	too long, reptitive and preachy.after a great start the book really bogs down and becomes preachy.	1
	would anyone really care that some of our judges and politicians are freemasons?	1
	most of them have done many worse things than participate in freemason rituals.	1
	does brown really think that someone who just lost an arm will run around dc?	1
	with somone who has their blood draining out  of their body for a few hours?	1
	or with someone who 'drowned'?	1
	the last 20-30 pages are not even necessary.        	1
	be warned: the writing is horrible and the story is mediocer.dan brown, in my opinion, has always struggled with his writing.	1
	he generally weaves an interesting story, but he does not have the writing skill to be a great author.	1
	in his newest novel, the lost symbol, dan brown's writing is worse than usual.	1
	normally i would push past this and attempt to find interest in the story, but in the lost symbol even the story is weak.	1
	this book was a challenge to get through.	1
	the writing was very formulaic.	1
	while reading i got the sense that dan brown was just showing off his knowledge about conspiracies.	1
	the plot never came together to form a cohesive story.	1
	i kept waiting for the author to pull everything together at the end of the novel in a way that would explain away the many confusing tid-bits of information and the many plot holes.	1
	the author, in my opinion, never explained the main premises for the book, something he calls the ancient mysteries.	1
	i never understood exactly what they were.	1
	this distanced me from the book on a further level than simply being confused.	1
	with previous novels such as the da vinci code i could relate to the book because while dan brown was making a ridiculous claim, the claim was based off of a common tale (that of jesus christ).	1
	the ridiculous claim in this book was based off of a less widely known tale.	1
	i felt myself not caring about whatever conspiracy that dan brown revealed about the free masons, because i did not care about the free masons in the first place.	1
	i also found the many religious references to be off putting and fanciful.	1
	the author stresses that humans are in fact deities, and that this is clearly stated in the bible and in all other faiths across the world.	1
	dan brown, by lumping many religions together and saying that they all share the same message, makes some incorrect statements about many eastern based religions.	1
	the author was grasping at straws with this book.	1
	it was clear that by making these sweeping generalizations about religion that he was trying to find another great, or at least semi-believable controversy, liken to that of the da vinci code's conspiracy.	1
	he did not find that controversy.	1
	this lack of a controversy or conspiracy meant that dan brown could make no shattering realizations with his book.	1
	there was no moment when one said, 'oh my god.	1
	that kinda makes sense in a ridiculous way.'	1
	i felt that this was why the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters.	1
	there was nothing to pull together.	1
	there was no sweeping statement to be made.	1
	this left the reader very unsatisfied at the end of the book.	1
	this dissatisfaction with the story as well as the truly atrocious writing made this book truly unbearable.	1
	i realize that many people will feel compelled to read this book out of tribute or duty to the books author, but i would suggest that the reader should not bother.	1
	the dan brown that wrote the da vinci code is gone.	1
	he has run out of stories to tell.	1
	please take my word and do not spend your money on this purchase.	1
	i will confess that i had reservations about purchasing this book in the first place, but i felt and obligation to read it, as my surname is solomon, which coincidently is the surname that one of the books main characters has.	1
	i however, am not incredibly wealthy, nor am i a prominent free mason.      	1
	entertaining - though not as good as da vinci code.the lost symbol opens with robert langdon being called to washington dc at short notice to deliver a speech.	1
	the request has come from his old friend, peter solomon, head of the smithsonian institution and also a high-ranking mason.	1
	when langdon gets to the capitol building, he quickly discovers that there is no event planned and that solomon has not invited him.	1
	instead he has been lured there because an unknown individual believes that langdon can help him to unlock an 'ancient portal' hidden in washington dc.	1
	the first clue is delivered via a severed hand (solomon's).	1
	in next to no time langdon finds himself teaming up with solomon's sister (a former romantic interest) frantically deceiphering clues in a bid to save his friend peter, all the while on the run from the authorities - and also from a mysterious villianous eunuch with a distinctive tatooed appearance who is desperate to discover the most closely guarded secrets of the freemasons.	1
	whilst there are obvious similarities to the da vinci code, the lost symbol focuses on new territory, specifically the world of freemasons.	1
	unfortunately, while interesting, the revelations lack the 'wow' factor of the da vinci revelations.	1
	the lost symbol is still an enjoyable book, but it's not as good as the da vinci code.	1
	i'd put it more on a par with his earlier novels.	1
	the book takes a while to find its momentum.	1
	the early chapters are cluttered with back story after back story.	1
	also lots of 'encyclopedia speak'.	1
	dan brown has clearly done lots of research while writing this book, but do we need to be told all of it?	1
	sometimes it felt more like i was reading excerpts from wikipedia than a novel!	1
	the pace does pick up though, and dan brown is still the master of the hanging chapters that get you staying up late reading 'just one more' - it's a long book, but you tear through it.	1
	you do need to be willing to ride with the (many) improbabilities, like the idea that langdon could immediately identify the owner of a severed hand or that the cia would let him help himself to criminal evidence or that he would totally forget that he was carrying a secret and vital box with him (until of course it was convenient for him to remember).	1
	the ending is also a disappointment: it drags out and the main twist is unlikely to surprise.	1
	despite these flaws, the lost symbol moves at a good pace and kept me entertained throughout.	1
	ultimately it delivers much what you would expect it to and if you've enjoyed previous novels by dan brown, it's a pretty safe bet that you'll enjoy this one too.      	1
	lots of potential, but little kinetic energy.an author can get away with a limping writing style if he can back it up with good pacing and a strong story, but brown offered neither in this book.	1
	a substantial portion of the story is told in flashbacks, most of which are inserted into the middle of current action, effectively killing all forward motion and suspense.	1
	i have never seen so many flashbacks in so few pages.	1
	all current action was bookended by flashbacks, causing me to see clearly why flashbacks are avoided as much as possible by more savvy writers.	1
	critical suspense scenes, death scenes and violent struggles are not the place for a character to take a two page trip down memory lane and review some old conversation they had with so-and-so that might or might not have some tangential relevance to their crisis of the moment.	1
	as another suspense killer, characters were prone to wander off into plodding intellectual discussions about the more esoteric meanings of some whatchamacallit or other--without seeming to have any sense of the urgency they were supposed to be feeling.	1
	some revelations were necessary, but i kept expecting them to sit down and have themselves a cup of tea while they pondered the mysteries of the universe, regardless of the axe poised over their heads by the plot.	1
	i got the impression that brown got so excited about the subject he'd introduced that he lost all track of his own plot.	1
	to further stymie forward motion in the plot, brown recaps at the beginning of nearly every chapter, like a television series that replays events from the past episode before beginning the current episode.	1
	this was especially annoying because the chapters were so short that it created an ongoing sensation of taking two steps forward and one step back.	1
	either this was filler or brown thought most of his readers would be putting the book down for a week between chapters.	1
	maybe they do...  it certainly drags enough to encourage that.	1
	as for langdon...  he sounds like a stuck record.	1
	brown doesn't seem to think that he can stress it strongly enough that robert langdon absolutely, positively and and even downright categorically refuses to buy into any mystical mumbo-jumbo.	1
	the redundancy is so extreme that langdon becomes nothing more than the voice of the skeptical masses so that brown can spout off with his rebuttal in the form of more enlightened characters.	1
	langdon becomes more plot device than hero.	1
	the net impression this book left me with was that its primary purpose was to provide an excuse for brown to pontificate about his beliefs and preen.	1
	it was not a worthy read.      	1
	just awful....in oh so many ways.this book is just a mess.	1
	at every level.	1
	1.  get an editor.	1
	boy does this book need vast editorial help.2.	1
	masonic history through rose colored glasses.	1
	skewed, adulterated, half-assed and just plain disgraceful.3.	1
	books need endings.	1
	4.  assnine new age gibberish is not an ending but it sure is annoying.	1
	hope you've invested you ill gotten gains well because we won't be fooled again.       	1
	you know the book is bad when.....you know the book is bad when...after reading 460+ pages of a supposed thriller/mystery/adventure novel you find yourself flipping and scanning to the end of the book just to get it over with.	1
	after putting in the time to read the majority of the story, i had to be able to say that i finally finished it.	1
	also, hoping against hope, i thought that the story might improve and that there would be a true finale to this tale.	1
	what a huge disappointment.	1
	the entire book was a mish mash of adages and random phrases that were supposed to make sense.	1
	honestly, most of the story was just plain silly.	1
	the reader cannot help but be suspicious and doubtful about the novel when there are many phrases per page that are italicized to emphasize that they are so important to the story.	1
	the reader just gets numb to it all and the emphasized lines have no more meaning that any others.	1
	with the davinci code, there was a search for a specific thing - the holy grail.	1
	in this book the object of the search was so poorly defined and poorly described, the very disappointing let down of an ending should have not have been a surprise.	1
	dan brown had a very good idea, story and adventure with the davinci code.	1
	however, his actual writing style is poor and juvenile.	1
	he seems to be trying to appeal to folks who do not read very much and he tries to simplify things to the point of boredom.	1
	the constant use of phrases describing someone as 'totally terrified', 'totally awed', 'in absolute shock', etc, etc is so trite and hackneyed.	1
	with davinci, the interesting tale overshadowed his poor writing and clumsy use of language.	1
	but in the lost symbol, the story was too dull in itself and the bad writing made things that much worse.  	1
	can i give it -5 stars?	1
	it's that bad.i am deeply disappointed in this book; it took mr. brown six years to write it?	1
	he should have taken six more if only to see if he could come up with a better story.	1
	the formulaic cliffhangers at the end of (it seemed) every chapter were at one point unbearable...so much so that i started skimming thru the pages.	1
	did robert langdon have a brain injury in his last book that i'm not aware of?	1
	why was he so skeptical of everything?	1
	you have a hard time believing 'the mystery' really!	1
	did the past experiences not teach you anything?	1
	he also seemed to be dumbed down in this book.	1
	the mystery revelation was beyond stupid; was the bible a forbidden book when our country was formed?	1
	if that's the case then i can suspend belief and say ok, maybe they did need that much mystery behind it.	1
	i could go on and on about how terrible this book is but it just makes me mad that i was duped into running out to get it.	1
	next time, mr. brown, it's going to be a paperback at the used book store or a garage sale - and that's if there are no other books available.      	1
	when searching for the light, don't forget to bring a flashlight.i just finished reading 'the lost symbol.'	1
	and yes, in its favor is that i not only finished reading it, i did so in two days.	1
	(you know the way you remove a band-aid by yanking it off in one quick motion, rather than peel it off slowly and prolong the pain?	1
	'nuff said.)	1
	first, i have to say that i think many modern american readers will enjoy this book immensely.	1
	it proposes more half-baked theories based in self-importance and elitism than any book in years.	1
	while the surface setting of the novel may be washington, d.c., the real setting is -- as always in his books -- a secret society that believes itself privy to secrets that the rabble are not aware of, and furthermore believes itself more entitled to lead the rabble and shape the world because of its knowledge of those secrets.	1
	the secret society in this case is masonry.	1
	and there is no question that, factually, masons have been 'movers and shakers' in western society for centuries.	1
	whether their beliefs and their tendency to dress up in funny clothes and perform odd rituals involving the mimicking of death and drinking from skulls did anything to enhance their ability to be movers or shakers or was just elitist hubris and spiritual cross-dressing, the fact remains that a lot of the world's movers and shakers were masons.	1
	the thing to remember in my opinion -- both when evaluating the impact of masonry on the world and this novel -- is that a much larger percentage of them weren't.	1
	if you've read any dan brown novel in the past, i don't have to tell you about the plot.	1
	a flamboyant villain (the albino priest from 'the da vinci code' wasn't flashy enough, so this novel has a villain who has covered almost every square inch of his body with tattoos ) tries to do something dastardly, related to a secret society.	1
	professor robert langdon steps in to save the day.	1
	the plot seems to involve supernatural events, but resolves itself in the most mundane way imaginable, without the need for any supernatural or esoteric explanation whatsoever.	1
	all of the characters spend the entire book talking like docents, spewing an almost unendurable plethora of facts at you, few of which are actually necessary or relevant.	1
	langdon still doesn't get laid.	1
	and most important, even though the plot doesn't actually rely on *any* of the supernatural or esoteric facts brown has his characters spew at you, and as a reader there is no need to believe a word of the esoteric stuff, after resolving the plot brown spends an additional 50 pages trying to get you, the reader, to believe in all the esoteric stuff anyway.	1
	it's almost as if he ends the book by justifying spending six years writing it.	1
	that said, it's a fast read and a veritable page-turner.	1
	if you *enjoy* spiritual elitism and conspiracy theories, you might enjoy being preached to by the literary equivalent of cliff claven from 'cheers' for 500 pages.	1
	just don't ask tough questions like how the smartest scientists in the world and the leader of the masonic order in washington, d.c. haven't figured out how to use a flashlight, rather than walk over and over through a pitch-black room. 	1
	disappointing.like others, i anxiously awaited dan brown's much-hyped new release.	1
	after reading it, i have to say that i was under-whelmed.	1
	the story never did click for me.	1
	'lost symbol' was not on the same par as 'angels and demons' or 'davinci code'.	1
	maybe i expected to much from dan brown.	1
	but the next time he releases a new title, i think i'll wait until after it's reviewed before i buy it.	1
	i certainly won't pre-order one of his books again.       	1
	anticlimactic and bad.this book fails on so many levels.	1
	i've tried not to spoil too much.	1
	any potential spoiler is marked with a ***spoiler*** comment.	1
	the biggest flaw is that it is the most anticlimactic novel i can recall reading.	1
	what is the big secrect behind the mason's lost pyramid?	1
	i won't spoil it for you but it's something you could probably read about in a tourist's pamphlet.	1
	what is the national security crisis that is so critical that a cia bigshot has to personally get involved with the field work?	1
	again, i won't spoil it but if you bother to read this book you will be sorely disappointed and in disbelief that the cia would even get involved in something so laughable.	1
	the storyline is weak.	1
	first it is the search for the lost masonic pyramid.	1
	then it becomes cracking the code found on this pyramid.	1
	we are assured several times that the revealed message leads to an actual place and to something very tangible.	1
	somehow, and without much explanation, the search for this place morphs into the search for the 'lost word'.	1
	what is so important about this place that we need to seek it out?	1
	not really sure.	1
	what happens when this word is found?	1
	no explanation.	1
	so we don't really know what the goal of langdon or his nemesis is and, more importantly, we don't really care.	1
	the motivations of the nemesis are not fully explained.	1
	why exactly has he declared katherine solomon to be his enemy?	1
	why does he feel the need to kill her and destroy her research?	1
	how exactly did he know what she was researching anyway?	1
	none of this is explained satisfactorily.	1
	plot holes and unexplained actions abound.	1
	***spoilers****  how did katherine solomon know to go to the library of congress after the destruction of pod 5?	1
	how did sato know to find langdon in the capitol?	1
	this question was asked throughout the story but never truly resolved.	1
	how did the cia get their hands on the video initially?	1
	***end*** brown makes too many references to his past work.	1
	in one scene brown blatantly inserts himself into langdon's shoes to explain how he never intended to cause controversy with his last book on the church.	1
	this is terrible form which breaks the suspension of disbelief.	1
	also, he again inserts kryptos (the real life coded statue at cia headquarters) into the story with an irrelevant subplot.	1
	he disingenuously (as well as unconvincingly) tries to imply that kryptos and the lost masonic pyramid are somehow related.	1
	the subject matter of the book is simply not interesting.	1
	there are no eye opening revelations about the masons.	1
	in fact, brown acts as more of an apologist than anything, going out of his way not to cast any suspicion on the group.	1
	the result is a boring portrayal and will not inspire the reader to any interest in further researching the masons.	1
	the other main topic dwells on mysticism and other esoteric topics like ancient animal sacrifice rituals that are supposed to imbue the practitioner with some kind of power.	1
	this kind of nonsense is just unbelievable.	1
	there is a reason these beliefs died out over the course of history.	1
	everyone knew they were nonsense and stopped practicing them.	1
	brown makes no converts with his ridiculous portrayal of a man trying to attain immortality through these rituals.	1
	it is clear that brown stopped writing at many points over the last 6 years only to pick it up again with different ideas which caused some parts to be rewritten.	1
	the result is a jumbled, disjointed, and anticlimactic novel with boring subject matter.      	1
	huge disappointment.this is not the worst of dan brown's books, and i've read them all, but it's pretty bad.	1
	it has the worst ending (a long, protracted, boring ending) of any book i've ever read.      	1
	so bad i couldn't put it down.this book falls well short of the da vinci code, which i found to be enjoyable and engaging.	1
	in comparison &#34;the lost symbol&#34; is badly written and annoying.	1
	i don't know whether it was the repeated non-surprises, the jarring way that brown inserts encyclopaedic descriptions devoid of any literacy, or the fact that i found it hard to care what happened, but this book scored so highly on the 'outburst' score that my wife told me to read it somewhere else.	1
	it is rare that a work of fiction can make me angry but mr. brown managed it without breaking a sweat.	1
	truly shocking.      	1
	symbol of complacency.this is a book that should be left behind in an airplane.	1
	dan brown took little care in writing it, so why should you take care of it?	1
	as mentioned in other reviews, this book seriously needs an editor.	1
	there is endless repetition - it reads as if brown left the manuscript untouched for days at a time, then simply picked up where he left off without bothering to refresh his memory about things he'd already told us.	1
	the best part of the book is the information about buildings and architecture in washington, which will lead to an upsurge in tourism and traffic.	1
	the worst is the careless writing, the frankly ridiculous plot and the one-dimensional characters.	1
	one plot element that even the publisher's janitor should have pointed out to brown is that his cia director sato (a spin-off of a james bond villain but not nearly as entertaining) should have been arrested for pursuing a domestic criminal matter in the united states - a clear violation of the cia's mandate.	1
	the plot, such as it is, should have involved the fbi but that agency doesn't even get mentioned.	1
	instead the cia swoop down and around washington streets and homes in a helicopter, rather than a car, and threaten langdon with all sorts of unmentionable cia punishment if he doesn't drop everything to help prevent the revelation of masonic rituals to a breathlessly awaiting world.	1
	oh, puh-leeze.       	1
	tedious, ponderous and utterly boring.not a da vinci quality, for sure.	1
	don't waste your money on this one.	1
	if the author edited this one himself, he should never edit another.	1
	if he paid some one to edit this book, he wasted his money.	1
	an utterly boring book.      	1
	terrible, horrible, no good, very bad story.please forgive me for having taken artistic liberties with the much-superior judith viorst books, but this seemed to be the best description i could think of.	1
	let me start again here...  i loved 'da vinci code'.	1
	i did & i'm not embarrassed to admit that!	1
	:)  the storyline was unique & the overall concept was compelling.	1
	like most others, i quickly moved onto 'angels & demons'.	1
	i found that entry less compelling - still with it's entertaining moments, but not a good, fun read.	1
	when dan brown finally rolled out this long-awaited follow-up, i was quite eager to get my hands on it.	1
	to my complete dismay, this book is terrible.	1
	i find brown's style of writing is juvenile.	1
	many of his chapters end with some type of cliffhanger (similar to daytime soap operas).	1
	however, by using this style of writing, the reader is manipulated to feel tension/stress (similar to the cheap scares offered by jason, freddy, michael myers movies).	1
	this is not to say that the book contains light material.	1
	quite the contrary.	1
	his book is filled with complicated, well-researched storylines.	1
	however, this, too, rang false.	1
	he spends so much time describing the back story that i have hardly enough time to care about the characters, as i've just wasted valuable brain cells trying to understand the bizarre back story, including noetic science & the freemasons.	1
	admittedly, brown's writing style is likely no different from 'da vinci code'.	1
	but, these points are so over-used that it becomes distracting.	1
	i'm just very disappointed, as an avid reader & one that enjoys a fun, enjoyable 'light' read as much as anyone else.	1
	the fact that brown took 5 years to develop this book led me to expect much greater things.	1
	sadly, that wasn't the case; please just save your money.      	1
	insulting and loathsome.i cannot believe how much i hated this book.	1
	everything, and i mean everything, is explained, in detail, for us.	1
	every time the protagonist opens his mouth, it is to explain something else.	1
	unless one desires to join the masons, or to understand the magic flute, there is no reason whatsoever to read this book.	1
	i very much enjoyed 'deception point', which i think is an extremely well written and planned suspense novel.	1
	nothing in this book comes even close.	1
	we spend almost 100 pages in the bowels of the capitol building, leading to nothing but another 20 pages of explanation of why a room looks the way it does.	1
	of coursem (spoiler alert), the fat girl dies, why else would she be in the book ?	1
	this is not writing, this is typing, and, thank goodness, i got the book from the library instead of spending money on it.	1
	a lazy writer, writing a lazy book.	1
	buy a dictionary instead, and read that.      	1
	not as captivating as i'd have hoped....(not really any spoilers in this review, but it may be considered spoilerish by some) after reading `da vinci code' & waiting years to get my hands on the next robert langdon book, i just can't help but feel incredibly under whelmed by this book.	1
	dan brown has had enough time to where this should have been a better book than what it turned out to be, but somehow this book ended up being just a big disappointment to me.	1
	the book follows up with robert langdon after his escapades in the previous book.	1
	(no, you don't learn anything about what happened to sophie, although we do learn that langdon has put out a book about the symbolism from his previous adventure.)	1
	langdon has been invited to washington d.c. to speak as a last minute guest of influential peter solomon.	1
	once there, he gets embroiled in a mystery of very high stakes as he must discover secrets that masons have tried to keep hidden for hundreds of years- and try to keep them from a menacing threat who calls himself mal'akh.	1
	really & truthfully, there weren't as many surprises or big gasping revelations in the story.	1
	you can see many of the big 'surprises' a mile away (i guessed mal'akh's identity very early on in the novel) & the riddles just aren't as great as the ones in his previous two books.	1
	i can't quite place my finger on why the mysteries & riddles aren't as interesting as in the previous books by him- it's not like the mysteries of the masons don't intrigue me.	1
	as far as character development goes, i really didn't see a lot of it.	1
	we're given a bit of background on each character, but only one or two people are really fleshed out.	1
	one of the more promising characters (cia operative inoue sato) has some of the worst character development in that it just isn't done.	1
	she throws her weight around but shows no real depth to her character, which is a big shame because it could have been far better executed.	1
	other characters in the book appear & are mentioned a few times but serve as cannon fodder for the villain.	1
	there's also the female sidekick of katherine solomon (sister of peter) whose main purpose is to serve as a sounding board for all of langdon's theorizing & such.	1
	(thankfully she's not a romantic interest- there's no chemistry between these characters.)	1
	after the big showdown with the villain there's about 40 pages of langdon & katherine getting most of the mysteries revealed, which after a while got a little dull.	1
	i couldn't help but hear the 'wrap it up' music from the oscars playing in my head at one point- i just wanted brown to get to the point & do a cleaner ending to the book.	1
	this isn't to say that i didn't get some enjoyment out of this book.	1
	it was good for whiling away a few hours, but as a much anticipated follow up it fell drastically short.	1
	(i wasn't even really expecting that much out of this book either...) i'm torn between giving this book three stars or giving it two stars- i've read far better from his contemporaries in the field (not to mention better from the author himself), but i'm going to have to face the truth- this book just wasn't that great.	1
	so yeah... 2.5 stars (but i'm giving it a 2).       	1
	looks like someone decided to play mad-libs....oh please.	1
	dan brown needs to switch it up.	1
	the davinci code was ok, angels and demons was repetitive, and this is plain gross.	1
	same topics, same character stereotypes, same villains.	1
	please, i'm just a young adult and this is offensive.	1
	the language and phrasing is painfully similar to the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	the race across some large area was mildly exciting in davinci code, but now it's just old.	1
	mr. brown needs to come up with some more material.	1
	also, the product placements are disgusting.	1
	please, no.	1
	this isn't even literature.      	1
	huge disappointment.having read all of dan brown's previous books, i was expecting lost symbol to be action packed and full of twists and turns, perhaps not a block buster like the davinci code, but at least interesting.	1
	however, i wasn't expecting the kind of really hokey stuff that i encountered here.	1
	for example, after a long build up of grisley murders related to the lost treasure and developing the idea that some fantastic surprise awaits, we finally get to the revelation that 'the word,' which had to be protected at all costs, was nothing more than a bible buried beneath the washington monument.	1
	then we are subjected to a long diatribe about how some incredible experiment by katherine showed that thoughts have mass and can produce physical changes and that science has proven the existence of god.	1
	the end result is not credible and hugely disappointing.	1
	i didn't really expect dan brown to come up with something to best the davince code, but i did expect a lot more than a tedious science fiction novel.       	1
	patetica.probably the worst book i read this year.	1
	i was high on expectations, been one of the first to buy, and what did i find?	1
	a book in search of an editor.	1
	every single scene is repeated three or four times, the plot is stupid, the author does not know how to end the book, the female character is surrealistic, the architect does not know where the wind comes from, a total, complete, absurd mess.	1
	and he took five years to write this?	1
	i dare to say that he only published it because the publishers forced him to do, as i know the stakes were high.	1
	take another ten years, and come with something as interesting as da vinci code or angels and demons (although in this second one, i could never digest the scene where the main character jumps from a helicopter and lands alive and well...)      	1
	could have been done in 100 pages or less.this book is not very good.	1
	mr. brown continually goes off on side bars that are not very informative or entertaining.	1
	they just serve to slow the book down.	1
	he clumsily presents the villian and 1/4 of the way through the book you know exactly who he is.	1
	the biggest disappointment is that we are expected to believe that there are invisible forces out there that can be tapped into.	1
	great idea for a fantasy book.	1
	very weak for a piece of fiction.	1
	his foreward tries to tell you this stuff is real, but the story just gets more and more into the fringes.	1
	yes there are people who believe they get super human strength from making blood sacrifices.	1
	they also walk around with their underwear on their head.	1
	very disappointed in this book!      	1
	horrible beyond words.first off, i liked the da vinci code and angels & demons.	1
	so, i am not a dan brown-hater.	1
	but this book was horribly written and horribly plotted.	1
	and, worst of all, the ending, the so-called 'lost symbol/lost word,' was utterly ridiculous...and not 'lost.'	1
	also, despite promises to the contrary, brown did not reveal anything significant about the freemasons.	1
	in fact, it seemed that after all the grief brown received from the groups he offended with the da vinci code, he went out of his way not to offend the masons.	1
	instead, he has offended his readers.      	1
	completely implausible.i was so looking forward to this book.	1
	what a disappointment.	1
	by page 100... really?	1
	this just has to get better.	1
	by 200... if i get one more boring lecture i'm going to scream.	1
	by page 300 i can't believe how utterly absurd this story is.	1
	page 350... time to speed read to the end.	1
	page 400 this has to be one of the lamest books i have read in a long time.	1
	the end... what an absolute waste of my time.	1
	on the positive side there were a few interesting historical and architectural asides.	1
	recommendation:  don't bother.	1
	if you feel compelled to read it, go for it, just know when you begin to think it's going to get better it does not and cut your losses early. 	1
	where are the characters?.in the lost symbol, dan brown seems to have forgotten the essential fact of good fiction writing: great novels are driven by characters, not ideas.	1
	the central players in this novel are flat, two-dimensional figures whose main purpose is to serve as mouthpieces for brown's ideas.	1
	it's not that his ideas are bad (some are interesting, some are hackneyed); it's simply that too many scenes exist largely to shoehorn ideas and historical factoids into the work, all to the detriment of any real character development.	1
	by the end of the novel, my concern for langdon and company was half-hearted, because as characters, they had taken such a backseat to the tidal wave of cosmological notions that brown had offered up.	1
	by the book's end, even after the plot had been completely buttoned up, brown couldn't resist a lengthy philosophical debate that seemed tiresome and gratuitous.	1
	finally, the novel is permeated by a howler: the cia doesn't engage in domestic law enforcement, so the means and manner in which the agency participated in the plot was preposterous.	1
	perhaps brown chose the cia over the fbi because he felt it had more literary mystique.	1
	the lost symbol is an example of a book which is intelligent, and sometimes clever, but rarely compelling.      	1
	beware of pre-ordering.this taught me a lesson-- do not fall for the pre-order hype, just because you liked the previous writings of an author.	1
	3 of us read it on our kindles and each of us claims we hated it more than the other two.	1
	i won a/c i couldn't even finish it.	1
	at least we didn't spring for the hard cover.      	1
	just awful - and incredibly disappointing and filled with errors.i don't have much more to add to what others have already said.	1
	'lost symbol' was terrible and i definitely recommend that if you really feel the need to read it, you wait until most of our copies show up for sale at a used book store.	1
	as another reviewer said, it was a page turner but for all the wrong reasons.	1
	the only reason i could get through it was because i started to play 'point out the errors' and 'who is the least likable and believable character'.	1
	from the beginning, i was set on edge because of the the locational inaccuracies and errors and (without writing spoilers for people who've not yet read the book) the powers ascribed to specific government organizations.	1
	has dan brown ever bothered to come to d.c.?	1
	anyone with a computer and google can figure out how long it takes to get from dulles airport to where robert langdon heads next and which organization is responsible for what.	1
	dan brown was sloppy and should have done better research.	1
	this book reads like he's been so absorbed soaking up fame and fortune with davinci code that he missed his deadline and then wrote most of lost symbol one drunken weekend.	1
	while i didn't think davinci code was incredibly well written, brown showed us then that he was exceptionally creative and a master story teller.	1
	i think so many of us have been waiting for lost symbol, just knowing the story and plot were going to be masterfully crafted.	1
	what a waste of time and money!	1
	dan brown owes me $16 and a few hours of my life that i won't get back!      	1
	not what i expected.i've read other of mr. brown's books and found them to be entertaining and page-turning.	1
	good summer reading.	1
	this outing, however, fell flat in so many ways.	1
	it was predictable, there was little tension/suspense, langdon appears unbelievably stupid (as in 'how can anyone with his reputation be so stupid?	1
	'), glaring plot inconsistencies, and all told in a hum-drum kind of way.	1
	the constant hammering of christian/masonic ideals becomes dull and, in no way, explains or forgives the action in the book.	1
	it's simply 'this book needs a message' hook on which to hang the rest of the tale.	1
	it does nothing to explain motive for the antagonist and, really, isn't at the root of his motivation.	1
	the cliffhanger 'beat the clock' devices were really neither - and any nine-year-old with a computer could have told the author so.	1
	many of the 'saves' felt unbelievably contrived.	1
	an immersion tank?	1
	one that uses a fluid that allows the person to continue breathing?	1
	and the antagonist (who didn't want langdon to live)  didn't know that?	1
	after using it repeatedly?	1
	the final reveal felt like a complete sell-out that was tacked on because of a deadline.	1
	overall, the book felt more like a story sketched out one weekend with a few details thrown in after lunch with the publisher.	1
	while in previous books, like 'the davinci code', you could turn the final page and feel that you'd enjoyed a well-told story, that was not the case here.	1
	in fact, i resented having paid $9.99 for the kindle version.	1
	it just wasn't worth it.      	1
	it's just not a good story.the characters are not believable, and if they were real, how lame they would be.	1
	i wanted to slap all of them for stupidity.	1
	i plowed through hoping the ending would reward me with something cool, but the ending was a big yawn.	1
	i wanted to like it.	1
	however, when it was not a total bore, the story and characters stretched my credulity and patience too far.	1
	i was just glad it was over when i finished.	1
	poor dan.	1
	i think he really is a good writer!	1
	i feel sure he believed in this story and the people in it.	1
	so much work went into this book.       	1
	lack of research.i first of all felt like not reading further when i came across cia agent name.	1
	the author used family name plus family name (both inoue and sato are typical jalanese family names.)	1
	he could have checked at least whether this name works.	1
	since this character appear all the time, it was really annoying but i read anyway till the end.	1
	as someone mentioned, last 50 pages showed too unlikely ending even  for a fiction novel and i was glad that i finished reading.	1
	dan brown needs an editor with a backbone.i really wanted to enjoy this book.	1
	like most people i dont think dan brown is much of a technical writer, but i enjoyed reading angels and demons and the davinci code for the ideas they brought across and the sheer thriller aspect of them.	1
	this book has very little 'thrills' in it.	1
	a lot of browns big reveals about freemasons and their impact on the united states are pretty tame.	1
	its certainly less interesting than the things he brings up about the vatican in the other two robert langdon books.	1
	the major issue where i am unable to enjoy this book is how clunky browns writing style has become.	1
	half the book is told in flashbacks...and often he will do the high school literature mistake of having a flashback in a flashback.	1
	why not tell a linear story, instead of dragging the readers out of the plot as it happens, to add a lot of useless exposition?	1
	its just plain bad writing, and brown has succumbed to it entirely here.	1
	his personal cliches are endless here.	1
	every time a 'big reveal' occurs he drags it out for a full chapter.	1
	langdon figures something out.......he talks about what he has figured out, without revealing to the reader what he has figured out.	1
	the chapter ends with langdon running off to confront what he has figured out.	1
	the next chapter starts on a completely unrelated aspect of the book.....then after that chapter is done, we get to the next chapter, and are told what langdon figured out.	1
	i swear that exact same scenario happens at least a dozen times in the book.	1
	its just tiresome.	1
	his villain is also very problematic.	1
	another religious nut who mutilates himself in some way, and seems to have super human powers in everything except of course in the ability to freaking kill robert langdon.	1
	there is almost no difference between the tattooed monster in this book, and the albino monster in the davinci code.	1
	they both have flimsy, at best motivations, they both have back stories that are cartoon like.	1
	they both are super strong, and super smart, to the point of being beyond human...and they both mutilate their bodes in some attempt to get closer to god.	1
	this book has more in common with browns very poor efforts like deception point, and a lot less with the fast paced fun of the other langdon books.	1
	this is a disappointing effort that i could never imagine reading again for any reason.	1
	too long, too poorly written with a plot that never makes any sense.          	1
	underwhelmed.i am a fan of dan brown but this book was boring and i am totally unamused and underwhelmed.	1
	i got to chapter 20 waiting with baited breathe for something groundbreaking or earthshattering to happen and really jumpstart this story, it didn't so i took the book and respectfully placed it on my bookshelf until the day i can make time to drive to the local library and donate it.	1
	don't waste your time reading 600 pages of a story that was told better 2 novels ago.      	1
	the marketing was great, the book not so much..da vinci code was new, fun, different... and had a strong plot.	1
	disappointingly, this book is flat, repetitive, the plot is predictable, much of the action is completely unbelievable - it is unlikely that anyone who has lost half her blood would be able to run around like a rabbit even after having had a transfusion, to say nothing of someone who was drowned in any liquid for a period of time.	1
	mr. brown, we need more from you than the basic $$ making formula!	1
	and readers, you might enjoy l. goldstone's anatomy of deception instead.	1
	well written and founded on historical facts, a good story.	1
	and dear amazon: how do you include that book on your 2009 top 100 customers picks when it has received more 2 and 1 star ratings than 4 and 3?	1
	i know, by sales volume -- but when more people dislike than like a book, i would hardly call that book a top customer pick!       	1
	waste of time and money.it is true my expectations were high after angels and demons and da vinci code , but oh my god.	1
	it felt like a poor attempt at a book at best.	1
	it is a screenplay for the movie that i'm sure will follow.	1
	is is not a novel.	1
	it definitely has its twists and turns but they make absolutely no sense.	1
	da vinci code was trully inspiring.	1
	it was able to shake people minds and that what makes a book great.	1
	lost symbol is a waste of time and money.	1
	movie is going to be a much better experience.	1
	it is sad to see what happens to writers once they achieve financial success.	1
	they become pupperts of the movie industry executives.      	1
	a solid b+.let me just say right off, that although comparisons to angels and demons and da vinci code are unavoidable, i think it's unfair to the book and the author to do so.	1
	i think the lost symbol should be judged on its own merit.	1
	i also think (respectfully) that all those reviews that keep saying that dan brown's books aren't literature are snobs and it's all a matter of preception and opinion.	1
	the books opens in the captiol building in dc and is set and centered around many of dc's famous buildings and neighborhoods.	1
	peter solomon, a friend and mentor of robert langon, our harvard symbologist hero, has been kidnapped and the villain wants langon to solve a number of riddles/problems or solomon dies.	1
	all this is so this villain can become the most powerful man on earth by using whatever the free masons have had hidden all these years.	1
	enter director sato, a small but quite powerful woman who heads another small but powerful department within the cia.	1
	she seems a little full of herself but i guess i would be too if i had my own army, oops i mean cia agents at my beck and call.	1
	it's an exciting chase that keeps the reader hooked but lags seriously in the last few chapters.	1
	the denoument is a little confusing and i think could have been edited for clarity and length.	1
	brown mangled the simple message that 'what we seek is within us' so badly that he wasted a lot of pages in talking in circles around the point.	1
	think of all those trees we could have saved if he'd gotten me to edit for him....no, i joke.  	1
	disappointing.what a disappointment.after reading all of dan brown's other books i was expecting another edge of the seat nail biter with well thought out characters and a fast moving plot line.	1
	instead i felt like i attended a very long and rather boring lecture with a few moments of action inserted as intermissions.	1
	nothing about this book moved fast and  several times i came close to not even finishing it.	1
	but i had hope and thought  the book might get better as it drew to a conclusion.	1
	it didn't; in fact the last  forty or so pages could have been left out of the book without being missed.	1
	don't waste your money or your time on this book.      	1
	the lost symbol hits a literary ice berg and sinks!.the lost symbol hits a literary iceberg and sinks!why am i flashing on nicholas cage and the movie 'national treasure' as i read dan brown's new mystery thriller the lost symbol?	1
	sadly, this book is simply bad.	1
	no it is terrible!	1
	4 times i stopped reading this mish mash of implausible, incomprehensible drivel.	1
	but i refused to let mr. brown win and plowed through to the bitterest of ends-and was not rewarded for my efforts.	1
	what a colossal waste of time.	1
	how someone could write such a fine novel as the da vinci code and then turn out this tripe is utterly amazing.	1
	the plot was marginal, the characters weak, the telling of the story ludicrous.	1
	i wouldn't go any further as i know many people will read this book simply because it was a follow up to his wonderful mega best seller the da vinci code, and i do not want to be a spoiler and ruin what little suspense there is, but let me warn you there's not much there.	1
	character development was weak to poor.	1
	mostly implausible.	1
	my favorite character is inoue sato, a dried up, old cia hag who carried much of the book through her abrasiveness.	1
	no gratuitous sex, language or violence.	1
	in fact not much of anything.not recommended.	1
	save your money.	1
	i cannot even recommend this book as a paperback.	1
	this novel will greatly harm mr. brown's literary stature as a novelist.	1
	i expected so much, and he delivered so little.	1
	it will be interesting to see what mr. brown does next, and if he can recover any of his da vinci code magic.	1
	sorry but that's how i see it.    	1
	annoying  tripe.a truly annoying book.	1
	sheer stubborness was the only reason that i was able to slog through to the end of the book.	1
	i hated, in particular, how everyone was always 'chuckling' - he/she 'chuckled'; robert/katherine, etc.	1
	'said with a chuckle'.	1
	maybe i'm just jealous that i didn't find anything worth chuckling about in this book.        	1
	a page-turner, yes, but too many repeats..a number of reviewers, including that of the new york times,  equate rapid page-turning with the mark of a good read.	1
	i disagree - comic book characters like the hero, heroine, supercop, and villain of 'symbol' become boring with 500 pages of repetition, and despite the sometimes interesting arcana of freemasonry, there is no real plot, just danger followed by escape ad nauseum.	1
	it reminded me of the serials i loved watching at my local movie theatre - when i was 10 years old.      	1
	not enough plot to get past the atrocious writing.as other reviewers have mentioned, dan brown is no literary genius.	1
	his writing style is as if he already knows this will be a blockbuster movie (and i know which character is designed for morgan freeman to play!).	1
	can someone do a word count of how many ridiculous exclamations of shock (i.e.	1
	'what in the world?!')	1
	are used in this book?	1
	too many silly bouts of disbelieving dialogue, too much repetition of the ancient mysteries (as if brown realizes that no one is going to understand what the big deal is--and, despite all the needless repetition, i still don't see what the big deal is); an 'imminent crisis' that would barely make the front page of the new york times if it were to come to light; a protagonist who literally does nothing in the final third of the book; an evil genius whose secret identity is telegraphed almost immediately; and finally and most objectionably, a payoff that is anything but.	1
	with a&d; and dvc i was able to get past brown's downright bad writing because the plot kept me turning the pages; the books were legitimately compelling, largely because they were controversial.	1
	but so little happens in his latest book, there are so few surprises, and the characters spout off their surprise so often (it's as if he wants to show how shocking these 'revelations' are because the reader just won't care otherwise)--well, there's just not enough there to overcome his weaknesses with prose.	1
	predictable, painful at times to read due to the poor writing, little to no climax, no controversy, an even more ridiculous and improbable a villain than normal--this is, plain and simple, a bad book, no two ways about it.	1
	it should say something that while reading it i picked up and finished several other books because i just couldn't get through it without taking a break for some good writing.	1
	i will most definitely not be in line on day one for his next one.      	1
	so disappointing.others have pointed out the 'phone it in' quality of this book and rightly so.	1
	it is not his best effort by far.	1
	it was so predictable and reminded me of the later books by robert ludlum with his bourne series and jack higgins with his sean dillon series - after the second book, there was never anything new.	1
	unfortuately, the financial success of this book even prior to publication will only serve to continue this slide in quality unless mr. brown understands the disappointment his readers have experienced.	1
	i know i will be waiting for some reviews before i buy anything else he writes.       	1
	ridiculous subplot.the main plot of the story is standard dan brown stuff and you can buy it or reject it as you'd like.	1
	it certainly makes for riveting reading as you follow the twists and turns of the story.	1
	however, it's surprising that nobody has mentioned the major subplot of the novel:  the involvement of the cia.	1
	i won't spoil it for anybody, but it is rather ridiculous.	1
	a matter of national security?	1
	that much suspension of disbelief is pretty hard to accomplish!      	1
	what a crock!.i will never waste my time again on another dan brown novel.the plot is identical to the da vinci code.	1
	spoiler warning, the final message of the book - all our troubles began when man perceived himself to be separate from god.	1
	that i had to read through 450 pages of code breaking to hear?its a pyramid, no its a word, no its a map, no its a word, no really, its a map, ok, its a word and a map......	1
	the lost purpose.i recently read dan brown's new thriller novel, 'the lost symbol.'	1
	i promise not to reveal any plot twists or surprise endings.	1
	however, i will say that there was only one plot twist that i found truly surprising, and that is indicative of my feelings about the book as a whole.	1
	in the interests of full disclosure, i've always found mr. brown's thriller writing to be workmanlike, the product of a studious journeyman rather than the output of an accomplished master of the genre.	1
	to give credit where credit is due, he absolutely has figured out the formula for commercial success, and i, for one, am not going to denigrate him for making the choice to pursue that path rather than die penniless on a park bench in fruitless pursuit of artistic purity.	1
	his current work, 'the lost symbol,' will undoubtedly be a large commercial success and be made into another blockbuster movie.	1
	the upside is that discounted sales of the book may increase brick-and-mortar retail book store foot traffic and online referred book activity, thus driving sales of other titles.	1
	and in today's publishing market, that would be a very good thing for all involved.	1
	however, no amount of marketing millions will change 'the lost symbol' into the thriller it could have been with one simple change.	1
	merely by deleting somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of its content, 'the lost symbol' would be a much better book.	1
	what 30 to 50 percent of the content should be deleted?	1
	it is the same 30 to 50 percent of unrelated content that ruined the later titles of tom clancy, another thriller writer who lost his way.	1
	there seems to be a law of the universe at work here that states, 'once a writer earns a few million and begins to believe the accolades of their fans and the brilliance claimed in their publisher's press releases, the writer feels entitled to preach rather than teach, cajole rather than captivate and provide indoctrination rather than insight.'	1
	what mr. clancy and mr. brown share in this regard is they are no longer writing books to entertain and perhaps, just a little, educate; they are writing books to advance a very specific agenda.	1
	while topics such as social politics, sexual politics or belief systems have long provided conceptual and foundational elements of drama and storytelling; they are best used, and by far most effective, when they are used as plot and character development elements, not topics of shrill and unrelenting browbeating.	1
	no matter how much i or anyone else may agree or disagree with the subject of mr. clancy's, mr. brown's or any other thriller writer's latest pet cause, the inevitable result of filling a large portion of a thriller novel with material that is more about advancing that cause than advancing the plot is a much weaker work and a diminishment of the genre as a whole.	1
	the purpose of a thriller is to thrill, not to indoctrinate.	1
	while it is almost certain that authors who pass over the tipping point of believing they are uniquely suited to lead the masses towards enlightenment regarding their particular cause du jour do so in good faith; they are, when viewed objectively, much more likely to slip into the category of the minister of public enlightenment and propaganda.	1
	that's a title most people would shun, since it is shared with another writer of novels and plays, the phd.	1
	and thought leader, paul joseph goebbels. 	1
	both good and bad...but then again, this ain't literature.let me attempt to explain why i titled my review as 'both good and bad'...i was one of the few lucky ones who stumbled upon the da vinci code within about a week after its initial release, and long before it became somewhat of a phenomenon.	1
	all i knew was, within about 25 pages or so after starting it, i ran out and purchased 'angels & demons'.	1
	the whole genre which dan brown seems to have invented single-handedly (i refer you to the dozens of similar-themed novels and at least 2 national treasure movies--and counting), is no longer as 'original' as it seemed when dvc first hit the book shelves nearly 7 years ago.	1
	first off, poor dan brown has a few things going against him right out of the chute, in that 'the lost symbol' is instantly one of the most anticipated novels in the past 20-30 years--and with expectations like that, face it, the uphill battle of matching the first two robert langdon stories was lost probably before he even began writing it.	1
	the controversy found within those two books is easily more captivating--not to mention more controversial than this 3rd volume as well.	1
	second it seems that in the years since dvc came out, people have (somewhat) forgotten that none of dan brown's books were of shakespearian quality to begin with...most seem to recall the huge controversy sparked by the two previous books to remember with absolute clarity that while immensely entertaining & creative, neither book could be placed in the same category as serious literature, either.	1
	strike two.	1
	let me say that had i not read 'angels & demons' or 'the da vinci code' before picking this one up, i would like to believe it would easily be the must read novel of 2009. comparing 'the lost symbol' to the other two robert langdon stories--and lets face it, there is no escaping the comparisons--it all depends on your personal perception on how where you will rank this one.	1
	again, the whole 'originality' of the character of robert langdon is all but gone having experienced him twice before, and again in both theatrical films--so you kind of feel as though you already know the guy even before he makes an appearance, which is okay.	1
	the entire premise is based on dan browns own 'formula', one which he strays very little from here.	1
	i happen to love short chapters, and if you do, too--the fact that there are over a hundred of them ought to make you thrilled.	1
	the so-called 'controversy' herein makes a much smaller impact (i believe) than what we had before...that isn't to say that it isn't interesting or even compelling, it just doesn't deliver the punch we have seen in the past from mr. brown.	1
	there is a lot of info contained in the book and you can clearly see that a ton of research went into the history of the story, and again, before you expect the book to be anywhere near as original as the first two ought to be just thrown out the window before you even begin page 1. also, one other thing noted by a few other reviewers: some suspension of belief isn't just a good idea, its downright necessary here.	1
	don't take it too seriously and i think that 'the lost symbol' is an excellent story and highly entertaining no matter what anyone else says.	1
	keep in mind that opinions vary...otherwise, a very solid entry by dan brown.	1
	i really enjoyed it overall.      	1
	a dull let-down.i don't read dan brown expecting great literature, i thought a&d; and the davinci code were very worthy specimens of the thriller genre, but the fatal flaw of the lost symbol is that it's as light on thrills as it is on substance.	1
	it's amazing that this meager plot is all brown could cook up in the 6 years he's had to write this.	1
	perhaps his shtick is just spent after 3 books, but his insertion of esoteric bits of historic trivia into the thriller framework of the book has never felt more clumsy or weighed the story down as much.	1
	a good portion of the book you feel like you're reading paraphrased wikipedia articles.	1
	this is one of the many reasons the book never quite picks up the page-turning momentum of brown's earlier novels, and the momentum it does pick up ends up going nowhere.	1
	the cryptographic puzzles are simply not very clever or interesting this time around, the climactic bits of action come too soon, and the remainder of the book flounders while the reader wonders if something more is supposed to happen.	1
	it doesn't.	1
	the whole plot here is implausible, lightweight and phoned-in, with only a couple of effective scenes.	1
	one of the two 'big reveals' here will be figured out by a majority of readers within the first third of the book, the other is will leave you asking 'is that really all this was all about?'	1
	yep.      	1
	wow !.sorry ... barely finished 3/4th of the book.	1
	i'm done.	1
	is langdon getting dumber day by day?	1
	like all characters in this book i am 'amazed' too!	1
	waste of money and time.          	1
	very average.having read through the book in a weekend sitting i have to say this can only represent a downward spiral for dan brown.	1
	after the popularity of da vinci code it would be hard in fairness to the author to match that book however this is weak in the extreme.	1
	there are several reasons for this the main one being holding the book back for so long (keeping it under lock and key) giving a handful of newspapers 50 odd pages to review (as though you could even get a half decent review from that especially considering the book is over 500 pages) made the reader feel that they were getting a top quality read here.	1
	unfortunately this is just seen it all before, read it all before and frankly lost interest.	1
	this book, is much less da vinci and much more regressing to his previous books where the reader is frankly bored to death with tedious technological ramblings posed as intellectual snobbery.	1
	the book centers around langdon being summoned to washington dc at (he assumes) the invitation of an old friend and mentor to give a last minute lecture on his behalf, unbeknown to him he has been summoned on false pretence by a mysterious individual who has in fact kidnapped his old friend and is using him as a bartering tool to convince langdon to assist him in revealing a lost secret (that coincidental langdons old friends sister is also working on but by scientific means rather than symbolic/religious and it seems has found the answer)  i wont bother revealing this great 'secret' so i dont spoil what plot there is or amazon delete the review but trust me, you are not missing mutch.	1
	que the secret society (illuminati in angels and demons opus dei in da vinci) this time its the masons (though the masons are in fact the good guys here, protecting the worlds secrets from, well the world at large it would seem)  its almost as if brown has took his que from the film 'national treasure' we can only assume that its only if you are a catholic, jew, muslim that you are de facto an extremist hell bent on death and destruction if you are a mason however you are just missunderstood.	1
	instead of the plump bungling french detective we have a 4'9 japanese woman who is the head of the cia (and for some reason has a remarkable degree of ignorance of history but dont worry langdon helps her out) bungling police, our usual dastardly villain this time mal'ak a multi millionaire (who spent some time in a turkish jail) with almost super human strength and a taste for tattoos and a spray tan that covers them with remarkable skill (he needs to tell us what brand that is he would make a fortune on most council estates in the uk)  instead of a villainous monk.	1
	langdon runs through endless tunnels under the us capital (same as angels and demons in rome) deciphers puzzles and ancient mysteries, hooks up with his old friends sister, escapes from the police, gets help from a few mason mates, goes on the run and generally saves the day.	1
	the main problems with the book is its just so damn tedious to read.	1
	it really is like a 'novel for the thick' brown cant just tell us for example 'langon arrived in dc' oh no, he has to tell us what the flight plan was, what airport, how nice the plane was, what shoes langdon worn etc.	1
	he bores us to death with detail that just isnt needed (such as when mal'ak disables a lock on a door what chemicals he uses, what they do and what ph they are (seriously dan do you think we care?))	1
	or how about his lectures on symbols, what they 'really mean' how 'most people dont know' etc etc...... take another example when langdon and female side kick espace on a dc subway.	1
	brown just cant help himself he cant just say 'landgon got on the next train and headed eat'  oh no we have to be treated to what train lines exist in dc what colour the lines are, when they were built, what colour dog the builder owned etc etc i mean who cares?	1
	brown was able to save himself with da vinci because most people have some knowledge of the church or even some interest, most of us know what the holy grail is (even if its just by watching monty python) however endless lectures about masons, science and various religious symbols in browns usual condescending manner is just frankly boring.	1
	a 500 page book that could quite easily have been 300. oh and by the way dan.	1
	soganlik is a district of kartal/istanbul not just the name of a prison (do they even have a prison in soganlik?).	1
	i should know, i used to live there!        	1
	mostly cut-and-paste from his earlier langdon novels.same plot, same characters (the book's villain and langdon's mentor/friend are copied straight out of da vinci code, although their names have been updated because they're supposedly 'different' characters), very formulaic; essentially a 70% cut-and-paste of da vinci code and angels & demons, with different symbols and setting.	1
	frankly, i love the mystery and intrigue of a new secret society and set of symbols/clues but can't believe dan brown is getting away with selling us the same book over and over.	1
	i think i'll skip langdon's next adventure.      	1
	zero stars would be too many - absolutely dreadful.first sentence:  the secret is how to die.	1
	robert langdon receives, what he believes to be, a request from an old friend to come to washington.	1
	d.c.  once there, in the rotunda of the capitol, is found his friend's dismembered hand.	1
	the chase is on; robert langdon and his friend's sister, against an unknown villain and members of the cia.	1
	i could go on and on about how bad i thought this book was.	1
	the bad guy was way over the top, langdon seemed flat, and the women were too stupid to live.	1
	the geography of washington had errors.	1
	yes, some of the information on the freemasons is interesting, as is some of the arcane historical information, but nothing really gels together.	1
	there's a federal agency involved without any explanation as to why they are there.	1
	there's nothing to grab onto.	1
	with davinci code, there was the whole mary magdalene theory; with angels and demons it was the race against the clock and would the pope get elected.	1
	here's it's about rescuing a friend of langdon's whom we've not met and to whom we have no real attachment, and about the great secret protected by the freemasons.	1
	the book is an example of bad dialogue, bloated writing, and repetitive scenes.	1
	however, the greatest sin was that i never felt engaged or cared what happened.	1
	nearly every chapter ended with a mini-cliff hanger and didn't add to the plot or the suspense.	1
	one or two wouldn't have bothered me but every chapter became absurd and amateurish.	1
	write a good story; i'll keep turning the pages.	1
	the only thing i didn't regret about this book was that i bought the kindle version rather than the $150 signed edition i was offered.	1
	no thanks.	1
	yuck!.couldn't believe how shallow and unbelievable the story was.	1
	i'm embarrassed to say that i actually kept at it hoping that it would get better.	1
	it didn't.        	1
	terrible!.dan brown wasted five years of his life writing this book and wasted a day of mine making me believe it was worth reading!      	1
	waste of time and money.most of the reviewers got it right--formulaic and poorly written.	1
	it is pretty clear that brown knows the value of the niche he has occupied and is milking it for what it's worth.	1
	although the da vinci code at least had some interesting elements going for it, even it was only a poor man's version of eco's 'focault's pendulum'--so if you really are interested in a thriller in the broader 'freemasonry-secrets-conspiracy' genre that will challenge your intellect and that won't let you leave the story behind (i still love and remember the ending after years, while the lost symbol is already gone, and i finished only yesterday), go for eco.       	1
	not brown's best work..i really enjoyed dan brown's first two 'da vinci code' books.	1
	they were well written, fun, exciting, can't put it down and have to stay up all night thrillers.	1
	i even enjoyed mr. brown's interesting view of christianity and the catholic church.	1
	the first two books those books were so well done that they motivated me to once again study the history, topics and people mr. brown presented.	1
	they were thought provoking and always good material as a conversation starter or debate topic.	1
	however, the lost symbol has nothing in common with the first two books.	1
	it is poorly written, the presentation of the masons, noetic science, christianity and other topics are jumbled and disorganized.	1
	i'm not the most original thinker and even i figured out the plot twists and surprises long before they were presented.i could go on for several paragraphs and describe in detail what's wrong with the lost symbol but isn't worth the time of effort because it is just a terrible book.	1
	save your money and go to applebee's for their 2 for $20.00 deal.	1
	it's a better value and a whole lot more fun.      	1
	a real disappointment.my review and discussion is extremely brief.	1
	i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	most were entertaining.	1
	this book was simply poorly written, badly edited, cookie cutter characters, and probably worst of all: boring!	1
	i should have stopped half way through and pitched in the trash, but i finished it so see if there was any redeeming quality that would appear late in this dull, repetitive, boring, book that actually makes videos of masonic rituals appear to be a possible national security threat.	1
	please.	1
	what foolishness.	1
	when i am three quarters of the way through a book and the characterization is so thin i can't visualize anyone, or suspend belief at any point, that is a really bad book.	1
	i am not that hard to satisfy or entertain.	1
	save your money.      	1
	juvenile writing....i waited anxiously for years for the follow up to 'the davinci code.'	1
	unfortunately, the wait was not worth it.	1
	rather than becoming a more proficient writer, dan brown has actually regressed.	1
	the writing is so high school.	1
	robert langdon is no longer a compelling character as he once was.	1
	it appears as though dan brown was just looking to write another langdon adventure to ensure greater sales.	1
	don't waste your money.	1
	i'd say wait for the movie, but 'angels and demons' was a weak flick it may be best just to spend your money on some other book.       	1
	i'm disappointed.i have read the da vinci code and angels and demons and now, the lost symbol.	1
	the quality has been declining steadily.	1
	the lost symbol has lots of excitement and is an interesting read until you get lost in the details and the incredibly long and worthless ending.	1
	to hammer home that thoughts and 'soul' have mass and can control things is ok in science fiction but it too far out to make this a complete and thrilling 'read.'	1
	i won't say more because the other reviews cover the same thing in detail.	1
	i'm familiar with freemasonry so that part is ok but enthusiastically overplayed.       	1
	a hand for peter solomon.i'd just like to add one small point that baffled me - apart from the troubling points all raised by my fellow 1 star reviewers - why was mr solomon (and doctors and everybody) oblivious to the fact that only a few short hours ago, his hand had been removed by somebody unskilled in surgery, yet he seemed to be in no distress at all?	1
	the amputated hand was the first supposed shock revelation, yet after wading through a further 300 pages to find out the condition of it's owner, we find he wasn't too troubled by the loss of this limb.	1
	not only not bothered by this, but also more concerned with entertaining mr langdon with more masonic lore even though you would think he'd be in shock, not only from his physical trauma (including repeated drownings), but having witnessed the return of his son from the dead, his sisters and his friends supposed murder.	1
	oh look, i'm... i'm speechless.      	1
	lost in the symbol.first, you have to discount the huge expectations awaiting this book.	1
	how do you follow the da vinci code?	1
	the answer is you don't, but how close can you come?	1
	good fiction has to be at least vaguely plausible (even science fiction) and some parts of this book are simply ridiculous.	1
	the secret cabals, the close escapes, the all too stereotypical bad guy who is smarter than everyone else around until he suddenly becomes dumber.	1
	the characters are little more than paper cutouts pasted in place to give potential to a movie deal and allow the casting to be innovative.	1
	you learn a little about the masons, not much, and of course the fate of the world is at stake.	1
	but the real horror of this book, is that the 'symbol' and the secrets are banal and boring.	1
	it's easy to guess what's coming at almost any given time, but you keep hoping you're wrong and there's a huge twist awaiting you.	1
	alas, at the end, all i could think of is, 'what's the point?'	1
	da vinci code is  a hard act to follow, but you can follow it better than this.      	1
	what a disappointment.the davinci code is one of my top five books of all time.	1
	i preordered the lost symbol from amazon the day it was available.	1
	when it came out i was too busy with work to give it proper attention so waited until i had some uninterrupted time on a plane ride back and forth to the east coast.	1
	i got through the first 100 pages and if it wasn't a dan brown book would have stopped there...somewhere around 150 it actually picked up and got good for a while but as many have said there is so much unnecessary description in the book i wound up skimming through about two hundred pages only to get to the end and what did i get?	1
	a huge waste of my time.	1
	angels and demons and davinci were great...this book was so bad on the whole and the ending was so atrocious it's almost as if someone else wrote it.	1
	if you must read it try and borrow it from someone...don't waste good money on it.      	1
	a tedious page-turner?.i enjoyed da vinci code although it was pretty much highjacked verbatim from holy blood holy grail.	1
	and eventhough i wasn't expecting as much from this book, it was very disappointing.	1
	first the good part.	1
	i learned a lot about the buildings and symbols in d.c., as well as things i didn't know about the masons.	1
	unfortunately, brown's style of writing is much like a seventh grader who has just discovered the exclamation point.	1
	less is more doesn't enter into the arena.	1
	breathless wow!	1
	moments abound ad infinitum and leave the reader exhausted.	1
	i thought the end was never going to end.	1
	the denoument came and went and still brown went on!	1
	and on!	1
	and on!	1
	if your time is limited for your pleasure reading, don't use it up on this one.      	1
	a great letdown at the end..in the beginning we are told about this fantastical mystical secret that has such potential power that it must be kept hidden or those less worthy would misuse its dangerous powers to the great detriment of all mankind.	1
	the masonic order was its guardian and they buried it at great depth in a hidden location.	1
	the uncovering of this mystical power is the object of the story.	1
	when we finally discover what this lost symbol is, it turns out to be a profound disapointment and not in any sense 'lost' or guarded or protected or even hidden.	1
	what a gigantic letdown.	1
	i put my (hardcover) copy directly in the recycle bin.	1
	too bad.	1
	the story itself is a colorful jaunt through the historical buildings in washington d.c., revealing some little known historical facts about our founding fathers and some of the symbolism in these buildings.	1
	that part was nice.	1
	but the noetics part i couldn't buy and the frantic involvement of the cia was also quite a bit far fetched.	1
	what we have learned here is to read the last chapter first before buying it.	1
	the ending does not live up to what the beginning promised it would be.      	1
	yuck.i am not surprised to see the lack of positive reviews for the book.	1
	plenty has been written by the others about how poorly the plot and story seem to progress.	1
	this seems like it was written by a high school student who scanned a couple websites on mythology, read a couple national enquirer's articles about up and coming fields of scientific study, wanted to write a book that brought together some cool ideas from their favorite movies and really wanted to stick it dan brown for his insulting treatment of christians in his early novels.	1
	the only people who would seem to give this a 3 or above would be christians offended by his first two books who are happy that he finally stroked their ego's and reaffirmed that they are the true keepers of the ancient mysteries.	1
	what a crock.  	1
	warning, some spoilers..i make it a general rule not to write reviews that contain spoilers but i really feel the need to vent.	1
	i won't go into the plot details and all that, so many other reviewers have already done that.i'll get right to it.	1
	what did i like?i liked this book just as much as angels & demons and the da vinci code.it's a page turner that's for sure.and like the previous two books there are more twists than a pretzel.i really loved the final twist at the end when peter solomon finds out who the killer really is.that was really the 'woah' moment for me.the character development was good.the pacing was good.not too long, not too short.you can tell there was major effort and research put into this book.how much of it is accurate?i don't know, nor do i care.	1
	i read dan brown's work because it's fiction, not because i want an accurate history lesson.	1
	what really killed this book for me was the ending.unlike, da vinci and angels & demons there was no real resolution.in da vinci you found out where the grail was hidden.in angels & demons everything wrapped up into a nice little package that made sense.but this book??	1
	?i got all the way to the end expecting something extraordinary to happen and it just didn't.are you telling me the masons would go to such extreme lengths with the stone pyramid just to hide nothing.we never found out about the ancient mysteries.it felt like the rug had literally been yanked right out from under my feet.i felt like, 'i just read five hundred plus pages to find out nothing???.	1
	'nothing world changing, nothing even really worth reading.just 'read in between the lines of the bible' and that's it.are you kidding me??	1
	?are you serious??	1
	?that's what was being protected by the mason's for hundreds of years?i think i know why brown did the ending in such a way.to make us think of, instead of looking for outside knowledge, we should look inward.that's nice (sarcasm) but like i said, i read brown's work for enjoyable fiction not for a history or morality lesson.	1
	i really wanted and was expecting the mysteries to be found and something major to happen and......it didn't.the book just.........ends.lame.	1
	other issues i had with the book were...do you really expect us to believe that the cia would get involved if some nut job was going to release a video of masonic rituals?i don't care how many of the usa's power players are in the mason's.	1
	i know there are many and have been since this country was founded.whoopdee dooo.would a covert video tape of their rituals really cause world wide upheaval?i think not.most people would shrug and go, 'yeah, so what?	1
	'rich people doing weird things, what else is new?i was expecting the killer to have access to a wmd or something of that nature, something that would actually warrant the cia's involvement.then we find out he's threatening to release a tape.that's nice (sarcasm again).so what!!!	1
	uugh!!	1
	!i loved the book except for the tape part and the very ending was such a let down.do i recommend the lost symbol?it's not essential but it is a fun read.like da vinci and angels it takes a long time for the book to really pick up steam but when it does it's great.it's just that the ending is just so wrong.meh, i hope brown is now done messing with the masons.time to move onto something different me thinks.three stars for a great book ruined by a bogus ending.	1
	different title, different subject, more of the same.i read for enjoyment, to be taken on an adventure of some kind.	1
	while i was taken for a ride, it certainly wasn't an enjoyable one.	1
	it's an annoying read.	1
	a chapter ends with a buildup and a question that leaves the reader hanging.	1
	as a literary device, this works to build suspense.	1
	but when this type of cliff-hanger approach seemingly occurs in every-single-chapter, it gets old, and fast.	1
	what little build-up there is, is a let down as the mysteries are revealed and questions are answered.	1
	as far as revealing secrets, when the 'big bomb' is dropped, there is little satisfaction and, like the previous novels, we feel duped.	1
	the revelation just isn't revelatory.	1
	while we may be gotten by a gotcha, it's cheap.	1
	this is probably the most consistent failure in all of the robert langdon books.	1
	there's no sympathy for any of the characters, nor do we care about the climax or if the protagonists succeed in thwarting the eminent disaster.	1
	the character's actions just aren't realistic; it seems they, that in the microcosm of dan brown fiction, everyone must act a certain way in order for the plot to unfold as the author would like, regardless of logic (or lack thereof).	1
	what worked in angels and demons, worked to a lesser extent in the davinci code, and even less so here.	1
	instead of the author leading us through an adventure, dan brown, by the time we're half-way through the lost symbol, has to drag us kicking and screaming.	1
	oh, and let's not forget the post climax denouement in which everything that has been built up through the preceding five hundred pages is torn down.	1
	as an author, i must say, it's a talent to be able to restore order, overcome the story's conflict, and yet have the characters grow not a bit. 	1
	skip this terrible read - worst of his books.okay, i'm guilty of blowing through the dan brown books.	1
	they're dumb, quick and have some creepy appeal.	1
	not this one.	1
	it takes place in roughly ten locations.	1
	really, really boring.	1
	main character is worthless, wanders through the book making a decison maybe once.	1
	if you want a quick, fun, thriller read go for the ice limit or old man's war.	1
	at last those don't talk down to you.	1
	if i could have given this book a 0 star review i would have.      	1
	not his best....after waiting three years for his new book, i was excited to pre-order it and rip through it.	1
	his research is, as always, tremendous.	1
	that said, this was not my personal favorite of the others and i have read all of dan browns books.	1
	near the end i actually put it down because the scene was so disturbing.	1
	don't get me wrong, overall it's a good read, i was just let down.	1
	maybe my expectations were too high.	1
	if you have any interest in freemasonry, this is the book for you.	1
	i found the washington tie ins very interesting.	1
	in my opinion angels and demons is still his best work!        	1
	my least favorite of dan browns works, disappointing.i was extremely disappointed with this long awaited sequel to some of mr. brown's other great books.	1
	the entire story lack any intrigue.	1
	the end seemed to ramble with no clear mystery or purpose to the store.	1
	the characters were not very interesting or believable.	1
	after reading the book, i was left very disappointed with the story!	1
	a co-workder read the book and felt similarly.	1
	this book almost seemed more forced as a work, sort of like he was paid and had to come up with something?	1
	i have no idea how they will make an interesting movie out of this one!      	1
	mostly boring.i loved 'the davinci code' so was looking forward to 'lost symbol'  it started off well with promising points of interest like the freemasons and washington, d.c. and a menacing villain.	1
	but the narrative became bogged down in lots of minutia, a plethora of boring details that most educated people ought to know already, little psychological insight, hardly any character development, and individual reactions to events that are impossible to believe = try walking down the washington monument just hours after having your hand lopped off.	1
	how brown could make this so boring and unrealistic is a feat in itself.	1
	the book needed lots of editing and more creativity!	1
	sorry i wasted my time.	1
	its ok!	1
	not like what i expected!!!	1
	!.easy reading like the others.	1
	not exciting like a&d;  or vc.	1
	you will have so many confusion..i'm telling you...like how she get cell phone signal in pod 5....and receiveng text & calls.	1
	how you can get out of pod 5..which is most secured area by some vent and chase a car...not even finished...you go back in there again..and burn the whole thing...its really really funny.	1
	anyway..feels like written in hurry...to make some money...      	1
	disappointing!!	1
	!.i was so excited to read this when it came out.	1
	and are two of my favorite books.	1
	i've read each of them at least 7 times if not more, so i couldn't wait for this one to come out.	1
	unfortunetley it just didn't work for me.	1
	to me it seems dan brown had a cookie cutter outline for all three books.	1
	with the first two it was fine, but by the third it just made the book predictable.	1
	as it was i figured out the ah ha moment less then half way through the book.	1
	then i kept wondering what happened to robert langdon...it seemed between the davinci code and this one that he lost some of his intelligence.	1
	i felt like he had to constantly look to someone else to explain what was going on.	1
	it got annoying after a while.	1
	basically i'm just glad i borrowed the book from my father and didn't spend money on it.	1
	this is one i will defintely not read again.      	1
	yet another slice of the crytologic pie.for me, dan brown's books are like domino's cheese and tomato sauce pizzas:  they aint bad, but they aint good either.	1
	'the lost symbol' is admittedly a page-turning, up to a certain point, and then the book bogs down and sloshes over the same items again and again and again.	1
	toward the end, i found myself skimming the book because i could tell it was all over and what i was reading was just filler.	1
	and the ending of the book was really disappointing, but it wasn't as stupid as 'angels and demons' which was mind-bogglingly asinine.	1
	but brown does manage to make the reader sit back and say 'oh, come on!'	1
	once again when the hero, langdon, is trapped in a box--i won't say more.	1
	brown's writing style hasn't changed much:  his perils-of-pauline chapter structure continues for over a hundred or so chapters.	1
	rather than adding interest or suspense, after a while it is predictable and downright annoying.	1
	getting back to our hero for a moment:  he's a cardboard cut-out.	1
	we get to learn precious little more about him; he is merely a vehicle by which brown can transport us across the dc landscape.	1
	the villain is nicely grotesque and villainy.	1
	there's a kind of a heroine, i guess.	1
	and the supporting characters are shades and degrees between the two extremes.	1
	there is no doubt that the plot is entertaining.	1
	and the mason references are all very interesting.	1
	hopefully, however, much of brown's linguistic pontification and erudition will not be taken all that seriously, as for example, his explanation of the etymology of the word 'sincere,' which is more folk etymology than fact.	1
	lastly, this review is on the kindle edition, so i didn't have a chance to participate in the decoding of the cover game that owners of the hard-bound edition were privy to.	1
	the formatting was very nice (kindle 2), but i still can't understand how spell and grammar checker allows certain typos to get through, as i've seen in several kindle editions.        	1
	advice:  set your expectations properly..dan brown's main character from his previous two books, robert langdon, gets involved this time with the masons in washington, dc.	1
	dan brown and his publisher are laughing all the way to the bank, with an initial release of 5 million copies, though i rate this book at barely 3 stars.	1
	(sure more stars equals a 'helpful review') but i'm being responsible with this review to prospective readers.	1
	as a follow-on novel to angels & demons, and the da vinci code, this book disappointed me.	1
	on the positive side, it's fast moving with all 505 pages taking place over a single day/night as is typical fashion for the author.	1
	it gives the reader a private look into some details of dc that most of us would never have known, much less will ever see.	1
	however, the plot is formulaic, somewhat predictable, and simplistic.	1
	it almost reads like he was thinking of writing a movie script, and less so a novel that we really care about.	1
	moreover, his writing style, while intended for the masses of readers he will have, is shallow, simple, and just very basic.	1
	nothing really thought provoking.	1
	but if that does'nt matter to you, then at least you now know.	1
	this book just didnt capture me, and though parts are interesting, i was glad to finish it.	1
	for those of you that decide to read it anyway, my suggetion is to not expect anything better or even equal to his two previous books - in fact less so - and if you can do that, then maybe you wont be as disappointed as i was.      	1
	not as good as what came before.the lost symbol is, for me, the worst of what i've read from dan brown so far...the da vinci code, angels & demons, and deception point were all superior efforts.	1
	the lost symbol seemed overly frantic, as if the story was forced to fit in the short time rather than naturally happening in that time span.	1
	additionally, i really got the feeling that he didn't know how to end it...many pages of what i suppose is 'denouement'...seemed to drag on and on.        	1
	too wordy and repetitive.i've read three of dan brown's books.	1
	the lost symbol was a drag for me for a number of reasons.	1
	this story should have been told in a briefer manner.	1
	many of the minute details including at what angle cars were parked outside(as an example) a home were just tedious and superfluous.	1
	besides the minutia there is a maddening amount of repeated information.	1
	the one character that has tatoos and body painting has the details  of those given nearly every time the character appears in the story.	1
	it seems that the author forgot between sit downs what he had detailed in previous chapters.   	1
	wait for the movie - it might be better..reading the lost symbol, or any other dan brown novel (yes, i'm guilty of reading them all) is essentially like buying an entire gallon tub of extra-butter popcorn for just yourself at the theater.	1
	it might taste good, but while eating it, you know it's really just a pile of buttered fat that's going to make you sad that you ate it later.	1
	amazingly, brown seems to craft his ridiculous tales using some ancient freemason secret that compels you to finish the book.	1
	trust me, no matter how bad it seems, you're going to keep reading it- this is brown's greatest trick.	1
	my three main gripes with the book are: 1. it's obviously aimed at the lowest common denominator of english literacy to maximize sales potential.	1
	if you want a taste for brown's writing prowess, go to a used bookstore, pick up a copy of any sweet valley high book, and read a few pages.	1
	brown's storytelling style is similar.	1
	2. the story is ridiculously implausible, with more deux ex machina than you can shake a stick at.	1
	i'm serious, there's probably 5 or more, for both the protagonist and villain.	1
	some are simply never explained.	1
	3. the characters are one-dimensional and clichd.	1
	langdon is indiana jones, but knows everything about history and mysticism.	1
	the bad guy (this should literally be his name) is evil for seemingly no other reason than to be evil.	1
	also, his transformation from drug-addled prison inmate to a hyper-intelligent, bodybuilder-perfect supervillain is a bit of a stretch.	1
	the female interest in the story is rich, thin, super-smart and langdon's age (shock!).	1
	i won't ruin the 'twist', but suffice to say it's perhaps the most sadly clichd twist in history, and does nothing for the story.	1
	the book will keep you busy on plane flights or as a brainless read before falling asleep, but keep that in mind before you purchase it.	1
	i'd wait until the inevitable movie, or until the book's in the bargain bin.	1
	2 stars for brown's amazing ability to make me keep reading through the pain.	1
	(thank you kindle for saving me $6)     	1
	too many symbols, not enough characters.while i enjoyed the masonic history, i closed this book never having even a smidgeon of feeling for the characters.	1
	i simply never cared that peter solomon had his 'blank blanked blank' (don't want to spoil.)	1
	katherine was cardboard to me.	1
	the two characters who stood out the most had the shortest appearances, the lab helper and the hacker.	1
	they seemed real.	1
	even the bad buy - i felt a bit sorry for him based on why he turned out the way he did.	1
	(can i be less spoilish?)	1
	i read books for characters - and no one in the symbol touched me at all.	1
	also, it was too darn long.	1
	i got tired of explanations.	1
	and the closed spaces in which langdon's claustrophobia was tested.	1
	he sailed through every one of them, so i don't think he's actually claustrophobic, right?	1
	i just finished 'the doomsday key' and it was a similar thriller - but the reason for the thrill was excellent and the characters were fleshed out.	1
	check it out.	1
	i read the symbol in an old fashioned hardcover.	1
	thank god.	1
	i'd have broken my page turning finger on my kindle as i sped through the pages.      	1
	i wish it would end already....this book is too predictable and relatively boring.	1
	i really liked angels and demons and thought da vinci code, though not as good, was entertaining.	1
	as for this book, i can't wait to finish it (if i can stay awake long enough) so i can start reading a good book.       	1
	a contrarian view.i actually liked the lost symbol better than the davinci code.	1
	the latter was, for me, a real letdown.	1
	it has a fast-paced plot that built up excitement and set readers up for 'the big reveal' only to give us a resolution about the supposed feminine divine that was a stretch to accept at best.	1
	the lost symbol, on the other hand, doesn't purport to be more than it is -- an entertaining look at the architecture of washington, dc, based on a plot that shows how easy it is for a zealot to misinterpret ancient (or sacred) writings to the great harm of all concerned.	1
	and i think the plot in itself is an allegory in that brown is pointing out a more mundane truth -- some people in our world today misinterpret sacred writings (aka scripture) to the great harm of everyone.	1
	there is clearly a great deal of symbolism in the artistic expressions of humankind, whether those expressions be in charcoal on a cave wall, in oil paintings of the vatican, in the design of public buildings or in the written word.	1
	those of us who cross over the mental line to narcissism and come to believe that only 'we' (aka our clan, tribe, religious group, etc.)	1
	have deciphered the truth can become a truly dangerous force in society.	1
	so my take on the lost symbol is that it's an average read, offering its readers amusement and a moral caution.	1
	my advice to those who haven't yet read it:  wait for the paperback.      	1
	because i feel generous, it gets two stars..'that dan brown,' i thought to myself several times as i read this book.	1
	'what an imagination.'	1
	credit where it is due.	1
	dan brown has a singular ability to take a great many likely very unrelated things and use them to authoritatively build a construct where none should exist.	1
	he managed to create a cute little path of illumination in 'angels and demons' and a grail conspiracy in 'the da vinci code' (where he somehow never got around to mentioning that grail stories don't appear until the 12th century).	1
	now in his latest book, he creates a bizarre masonic conspiracy that involves a mcguffin so great it could change the whole world.	1
	the cia is also involved, for some reason.	1
	also, a man gets his hand cut off, and robert langdon runs around staring, at various times, in wonder, in awe, in stunned silence and bewilderment.	1
	the book carries langdon on a chase around washington, dc, on one rather memorable sunday night during the football playoffs.	1
	a mysterious call, apparently on behalf of a friend of his, sends him on his mission to apparently uncover some great masonic secret or, depending on what's happening at any given moment in the story, not uncover some great masonic secret.	1
	this book was pretty insufferable, really.	1
	i rather liked 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code' had it's moments, but this book didn't really.	1
	from the moment the concept of 'noetic sciences' was introduced (you ever hear of 'the secret'?	1
	it's that), my eyes began rolling and didn't stop until the end, and then that was only because i think whatever muscle controls the rolling had gotten tired.	1
	there's so much of this book that just doesn't make sense.	1
	take the involvement of the cia.	1
	what appears to be their internal affairs office spends much time running around dc, sending black ops people to do things and generally pushing around folks from other departments (hilariously the director of this office tells someone else, employed by an entirely different branch of the government, that she outranks him.	1
	this is like the chicago pd's internal affairs department saying they outrank an nyc police officer).	1
	of course the cia isn't allowed to operate on american soil, but since we all 'know' they do anyhow, brown has them do so in this book.	1
	there's no real reason for them to.	1
	he could've had it be the fbi, and that would've made a lot more sense and not strained credibility, but whatever.	1
	and then there's the noetic sciences nonsense.	1
	did you know thoughts have mass?	1
	i didn't, and i'm willing to bet this is news to most physicists, too.	1
	brown likes to spout off a bunch of 'scientific' theories in the book as though they are fact, which gets really irritating after a bit.	1
	also laughable is someone sustaining a very, very serious injury for which they have had no medical treatment, as well as dealing with the after affects of torture, and a serious psychological jolt... and a couple hours later this same person is traipsing about washington without a care in the world or any real medical attention.	1
	right.	1
	there's one line towards the very end of the book where someone says, 'i have witnessed human minds affecting the physical world in myriad ways.'	1
	you know what?	1
	i have, too.	1
	those minds power hands, for example.	1
	i suggest you use your hands to not pick up this book... ... ok, that's a little strained, but you get the idea.	1
	:) the book gets two stars because it held my attention (when my eyes weren't a spinnin'), but it gets one star for everything else.	1
	not worth buying.      	1
	dan brown at his worst.i guess i should have suspected something when i saw the critics on the back cover discussing the da vinci code instead of the book i had just bought.	1
	the plot is very predictable and uninspired, the writing is poor, and the characters not enticing.	1
	these are a few hours of my life i won't get back.	1
	don't buy this book.	1
	don't waste your time reading it.      	1
	how much is dan brown paying you 5-star reviewers and where do i sign up?.dan brown must be paying people to write 4 and 5 star reviews after all the honest 1 and 2 star early reviews here because no one capable of reading could possibly give this book more than 2 stars.	1
	for all the reasons stated here in reviews over and over (cartoon characters, repetition, silly italics, implausible plot points, boring, etc.)	1
	lost symbol marks a low point in publishing.	1
	i bought it suspecting a train wreck and was not disappointed.        	1
	if you want to stay a dan brown fan, don't read this book..i was expecting a roller-coaster ride of a thriller.	1
	i was ready for my mind to expand, my pulse to race... all that.	1
	so with such high expectations, i dove in.	1
	and was sorely disappointed.	1
	the book itself is standard dan brown fare - lots of historical details, intrigue, and of course, fiction.	1
	but the overall feel was that of an author producing a work because he had already spent the advance.	1
	not inspired.	1
	not groundbreaking.	1
	not interesting.	1
	if anyone else had written this, i would have stopped reading it at several points in the book.	1
	i so hoped it would get better.	1
	nope.	1
	it went the other way.	1
	the whole thing was so formulaic, you could drop the book and lose your place, pick it up, find a passage that sounded like what you had just been reading, and you would actually be three chapters ahead (or just as easily, behind), and find yourself at a loss because the sequence template is reused so often.	1
	someone is always asking:  'have you heard the legend that x is y?'	1
	and the other guy says 'yes, but i always thought that was bs.'	1
	and so on.	1
	i so hoped someone would finally say, 'yeah, actually, it is bs...' so i would be reading, thinking how bad the story was, and and i would think, 'it can't get worse,' and it would - so much worse, in fact that i wished i could return it.	1
	but you can't return it, so i would try to re-engage as mr. brown would be building up this huge dramatic bit about the hero being taken to a mysterious place, but he didn't now where he was being taken, and there was this huge buildup of tension prior to the reveal, but the problem is i knew where he was.	1
	it just isn't that well crafted.	1
	there are a lot of great books available on amazon.	1
	this is not one of them.      	1
	awful!.amateurish.	1
	stupid mistakes and assumptions.	1
	all aspects of the cia security director are laughable.	1
	the story is so disjointed and ill-conceived that i simply stopped reading the book less than half way through...      	1
	dan brown is grasping at straws.my preference of his books are in this order angels & demons, davinci code, and last the lost symbol.	1
	in my opinion the book was the same formula as all the rest, which i like, but it got so repetitive with leaving every chapter as a cliff hanger.	1
	some times chapters would pass including the irritating 'mini' chapters until the last hanger resolves.	1
	also if peter solomon was such a big influence on roberts life (like a second father) why are we only now being introduced to him in this third book following robert?	1
	the end was about a big of a letdown as i've ever read.	1
	honestly.	1
	he was pretty much grasping at straws with that one..the word.	1
	it seemed as if peter knew the answer all along.	1
	the word pretty much destroyed the end of the book for me.	1
	i felt like i wasted 500 pages of my time when the book could have been 300 with a better ending.	1
	one big letdown.      	1
	a big buildup to .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	very little.this book was very disappointing.	1
	brown delivers a good page turner as his story unfolds.	1
	no real complaint there.	1
	but the end?	1
	it's not quite as bad as one of those stories where someone wakes up in the end from a dream so none of it happened.	1
	but this book contains several murders and involves a high-level cia official, the architect of the u.s. capitol and the head of the national cathedral in a frantic effort to stop a terrible threat to national security and a revelation that will change the course of human history -- perhaps, gasp, with dire consequences.	1
	but once brown has peeled this onion to its core, there's nothing there.	1
	yawn.	1
	i guess it doesn't matter if you produce a weak book if you've become famous enough that your publisher knows it will sell.      	1
	the only thing lost; my time & my money.there's a week of my life i can't get back.	1
	the lost symbol was the most boring and repetitious book i have ever read; aside from digital fortress and deception pointe.	1
	he fills too many pages with the same unrealistic garble over and over.	1
	without spoiling it for others; the motive was so unlikely and unintelligent, extremely disappointing; that i personally could not believe a writer of that magnitude has such little imagination.	1
	sorry dan, but the shoes of davinci code are too big to fill.	1
	i'll pass on the movie; and do laundry instead.        	1
	deciphering boredom.how do you decipher boredom?	1
	you try by reading the lost symbol.	1
	immense letdown from the fiftieth page on.	1
	totally incredible (as in, unbelievable) plot that actually snubs the reader's intelligence in favor of 'oh my god' storytelling.	1
	characters: annoying at best, one dimensional at worst.	1
	a hero in dire need of characteristics: langdon's not merely an anti-hero, he's an anti-character...a dull, faceless 'professor' who barely participates in the action and worse yet, appears 'dumber' here than in the two previous novels.	1
	surely, by the third book in a series, we should all come to know and 'love' langdon.	1
	but he's even more listless here than he was in da vinci code (compare to angels & demons, where we truly get the sense he knows his stuff!).	1
	a villain with no surprise to him.	1
	background characters that serve no purpose, even when they are part of the action.	1
	situations that not only challenge the reader's willful sense of suspended disbelief, but challenge the notion brown can write at all.	1
	this is a 'pro tools' novel.	1
	a work forged with the barest of writing needed.	1
	one senses this is a skeleton of a much bigger work that brown needed time to write yet sadly didn't have.	1
	finally, the pacing and structuring is dreadful and uncaptivating.	1
	plot devices (especially flashbacks) enter and exit at the most inopportune moments and in clumsy fashion.	1
	and that ending is one bona fide stinkeroo!	1
	i really enjoyed angels & demons and  liked da vinci code.	1
	this one however, is far from the pinnacle of the pyramid.	1
	hollywood & mr. hanks take heed: ingore and be better off for it.	1
	film this one at your own peril.      	1
	the left behind series.deflated is all i can say.	1
	two thirds into this story and then the plot ends and we are swept into some kind of religon qwest.i expected better.	1
	atlantis legacy by t. greanias is better and faster read.i felt left behind and should have stop reading after .... you will know when get there.	1
	some will like so  i will not reveal all.      	1
	the lost author!.when i purchased this book i was expecting to read a well written and investigated mystery and code breaking story.	1
	what i found in the pages of this hefty volume was a regurgitated storyline from his previous two books.	1
	i feel, as many other reviewers feel like i was duped.	1
	the book is not a labyrinth of complex riddles and clues, nor is it fast paced.	1
	it is a laborious, tedious and annoying book to read.	1
	if you look at mr. browns photograph on the website for amazon you will notice that he is wearing the clothing of his protagonist.	1
	i think dan brown has been so caught up in his own success from his last two books that he lost sight of his character.	1
	in the end, with nothing new to say mr. brown takes the reader on a laborious read through tedious details because he just didn't have anything new to write.	1
	it is said that an author must make each work better then the work before it, this work did not even come close.	1
	it wasted my time and money, 'caveat emptor' let the buyer beware. 	1
	disappointing.i read and enjoyed the davinci code, angels & demons as well as digital fortress.	1
	i did not enjoy the lost symbol at all.	1
	the story was poorly written the plot was at times so ridiculous that i found myself repeatedly rolling my eyes.	1
	it's infuriating how stupid katherine solomon's character is.	1
	agent sato's belligerence did not make sense at all.	1
	i'm vastly annoyed by the ending and i also knew who the villain was way too soon in the story.	1
	it really was not worth the time i spent reading it.        	1
	buy a comic book....a faster read and probably better.like so many others, i swallowed all that raving pre-release hype and bought this book,a makeover of the da vinci code with even more cardboard characters.	1
	the author does everything except say 'wow!	1
	look what the next surprise is'.	1
	unfortunately, the next 'surprise' becomes more and more boring if not implausible.	1
	the 'plot twists' are absurd to say the least and the recuperative powers of some of these folks is itself worthy of scientific study.	1
	i forced myself to finish this novel but it wasn't easy.	1
	it does have one redeeming feature though: i know now not to waste even more money to see the movie.	1
	btw...i would have rated it one star instead of two but i don't hate any book.	1
	amazon might consider describing a one star rating as 'total disappointment' which, in my opinion, describes this book perfectly .       	1
	a bit of a disappointment.it was annoying that about half of the writing he devoted to free masons he spent defending them.	1
	i didn't want to hear how great free masons were i just wanted deeper information about them.	1
	i didn't like that he left the reader hanging at the end of almost every chapter.	1
	it is a trick michael crichton used at the end of each of his chapters and it is pretty annoying when it was overused.      	1
	da vinci code for dummies.i was expecting this book to be like angels and demons and the da vinci code, an entertaining, diverting book for anybody willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.	1
	what a disappointment!	1
	now i know why the publisher refused to send critics advance copies of this book.	1
	the spoiler they were afraid of is that this is a very inferior version far more entertaining da vinci code.	1
	it looks like brown decided to make a more money from his work on the da vinci code by substituting a tattooed madman for the albino, the freemasons for the catholic church, dc landmarks for european churches and then throwing in some pseudo science and new age spiritual drivel.	1
	every plot twist is incredibly obvious.	1
	is there anybody who hadn't figured out mal'akh's identity long before this 'surprise' revelation?	1
	if this downward spiral continues, brown's next novel will be set in roswell, new mexico and feature robert langdon racing against darth vader to discover the true results of the alien autopsy.      	1
	absolutely the worst book i have ever read.and i've read some dogs!	1
	let me preface this by saying i am a librarian who buys the fiction for a middle sized library and because i knew there would be high demand purchased 50 copies of this book.	1
	i should have known better.	1
	it is perhaps the most boring book i have ever read, endless prattle about the mysterious 'word', a climax coming at least 40 pages before the end of the book, preachiness to the extreme, and repetition repetition, repetition!	1
	when i see the many well written page-turning thrillers that exist and that are bypassed in favor of mr. brown's books, i want to scream...but unfortunately that is not allowed in the library.	1
	and as for the one star rating.	1
	evidently amazon does not accept ratings with 'no stars.'	1
	microwaved maccryptic and coffee.	1
	'[we] have a name in the studio, and we call it the 'macguffin.'	1
	it is the mechanical element that usually crops up in any story.	1
	in crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers.'	1
	thus spoke alfred hitchcock at columbia university in 1939, explaining the macguffin, a device that has little other significance but to drive the plot.	1
	the plot--at least in hitchcock's hands--is such a fantastic ride that the actual thing the macguffin is doesn't matter.	1
	dan brown's technique is to use a variant of the macguffin wherein the device driving the story is purported to have a secret or mysterious significance that, in the end, means nothing.	1
	maybe we could call it the 'maccryptic.'	1
	in dan brown's blockbuster, the da vinci code, the thing being sought was literally (however one might read it) the holy grail.	1
	in his latest best seller, the lost symbol, the maccryptic is a secret, mason-protected word.	1
	in both cases, the maccryptics drive the plot--in the da vinci code more successfully than in the more plodding the lost symbol.	1
	but unlike the macguffin-driven hitchcock plots, dan brown makes you want to care about the maccryptics, which makes the revelation of their ultimate lack of any real significance such a letdown.	1
	like the da vinci code, the lost symbol can be fun, in the way an old favorite roller coaster is fun.	1
	you know the basic layout, and what the curves, dips, and rises feel like, and it can be a repeatably enjoyable experience.	1
	but sometimes it can equally feel old hat.	1
	despite the change of locale to washington, d.c., the lost symbol feels like dj vu.	1
	the book's main character, the returning robert langdon, practically says as much as he experiences yet another overnight chase through both picturesque and claustrophobia-inducing settings.	1
	the other characters are interesting enough despite the presence yet again of government authorities who are incapable of reasonable thought and action.	1
	but what gets people to buy dan brown's books is the promise that all the crazy running around is backed by something cool and mysterious.	1
	brown can't really have fun with that premise because he won't let mystery take over.	1
	instead, we get a rather hollow sermon on divinity as metaphor.	1
	it's like going to an initially enjoyable party that crashes with morose, tired drunks talking about existentialism.	1
	time to find another party!	1
	in brief, a somewhat fun, if ephemeral ride to nowhere.	1
	as the masonic bible, quoted in the lost symbol, says, 'time is a river...and books are boats.'	1
	this boat won't be around for long.	1
	we waited for this?.well...we waited for this?	1
	really weak across the board.	1
	was he getting paid by the word, is that why every statement and concept gets repeated in subsequent chapters?	1
	i enjoyed 'the davinci code' and 'angels & demons', but this gives fiction a bad name.      	1
	the lost symbol.very disappointing and exhausting.	1
	will make an interesting movie.	1
	put it in 3d and we will all be sick.      	1
	started great, then lost steam....for about the first half of the book, i was hooked.	1
	even though i figured out the major plot twist, i was still fine with watching it unravel.	1
	however, the last 1/3 of the book was a disappointment, and the ending was a real 'huh?'	1
	moment for me.	1
	i agree with another review that a lot of minute detail could have been left out without sacrificing character development and plot or story lines.	1
	i stopped reading tom clancy for the same reason - endless droning on about pointless details.   	1
	same formula.if you read the da vinci code, you'll recognize the formula.	1
	in a similar format, brown takes us through a de-coding in dc.	1
	aside from some interesting factoids about our national symbols, there's only one 'surprise' element.	1
	the end of the book gets almost flag-waving and preachy.	1
	he's written better and i hope he will again.      	1
	finally, dan brown writes about something i'm interested in!.for years i was dan brown's fan, his only one.	1
	i have a first edition hardback of angels & demons.	1
	and when i had a whole stack of galleys of the da vinci code six months before publication i couldn't give them away.	1
	well, what a difference the better part of a decade makes.	1
	while i enjoyed the da vinci code, i didn't enjoy the endless over-the-top hype of the novel and the zillions of da vinci clones.	1
	enough already.	1
	and, truthfully, brown's religious subject matter really didn't interest me.	1
	so, i can't say that i've been particularly excited about the publication of the lost symbol.	1
	yeah, i bought it the day it went on sale, but i was at home sick as a dog with the flu.	1
	the price was right on kindle, as was the convenience factor, and i was hoping to have the machine read to me as i wasn't quite well enough to tackle the task for myself.	1
	therefore, i was disappointed after purchase to see the read aloud feature disabled for this novel.	1
	boo hiss, doubleday.	1
	anyway, i eventually got healthier and began to read again and discovered that dan brown has finally tackled a subject of real interest to me--my hometown, washington, dc.	1
	as the novel opens, robert langdon is literally jetting to dc to give an important speech as a favor to a dear friend.	1
	rushing to his destination in the us capitol, langdon discovers the circumstances of his visit to dc are not what he was led to believe.	1
	soon, he's embroiled in another elaborate, puzzle-filled, life-threatening hunt through the nation's capitol.	1
	he's dodging the cia, while unraveling arcane masonic clues, and sparring with a mad man.	1
	in other words, pretty much what you'd expect from dan brown.	1
	for me, personally, the symbolic tour of washington, dc was a true joy.	1
	and the ties to the smithsonian institution, where i once worked, were an added bonus.	1
	these plot elements had me happily flipping electronic pages all through the first half of this lengthy novel.	1
	i was enjoying the lost symbol significantly more than i had expected.	1
	however, the deeper i got into the novel, the less fresh it felt.	1
	first, there is the villain, mal'akh, or whatever he wants to call himself.	1
	it doesn't take the reader long to realize the guy is a complete and total nut job.	1
	and once you get past the more lurid aspects of his character and story, it gets kind of old.	1
	how much crazy do you have to read before it get boring and repetitive.	1
	he's nuts.	1
	we know it.	1
	move on.	1
	second, brown again falls back on all his favorite plot devices.	1
	tricks like referring to characters without using their name, so as to obscure identity as long as possible.	1
	or having characters have major information that is hidden from the reader.	1
	these things are tricks.	1
	they're used in a heavy-handed manner.	1
	and, again, it all just begins to feel manipulative and old.	1
	plus, the revelations when they finally, finally come just aren't that exciting.	1
	third, there are plot elements that were supposed to be huge surprises that were just so obvious to me.	1
	i'm not saying that every single reader will pick up on the stuff that i did, but they might have clued into something else.	1
	i'd be surprised if they didn't.	1
	so, a mixed reaction from me.	1
	i really enjoy robert langdon's lectures.	1
	i think the symbology is genuinely interesting.	1
	having so much of it revolve around a location i'm intimately familiar with was a special treat for me.	1
	there were a lot of plot elements that were just a lot of fun, and on one level this is a light, entertaining read.	1
	the second half of the book didn't work as well for me.	1
	i think brown returned to his bag of tricks too often and ultimately revelations disappointed.	1
	for a less critical reader simply looking for a page-turner, you could do worse.      	1
	transformation through books.i like a book that teaches me something.	1
	and for that reason, i gave dan brown four stars.	1
	when i finished the book, i felt that my life had somehow been enriched with all the new knowledge that i acquired.	1
	having said that i would add that robert langdon seemed to have become 'dumber' than he was in angels and demons and davinci code.	1
	although in the book he is sought after for his knowledge, he repeatedly has, 'no that can't be, oh i guess it is!'	1
	moments.	1
	the violent scenes appear to be written for a movie.	1
	and the end gets very 'preachy'; many pages with paragraphs of dialogue-no action.	1
	but i must say, i can't wait to revisit dc with my new perspective.	1
	i wonder how many tv specials will focus on all that this book brings to light.	1
	thanks for the enlightening education, dan brown.        	1
	an ok read, but not spellbinding.i'm one of those readers who stops reading if not 'grabbed' within the first 50 pages.	1
	i almost threw this one away.	1
	first of all, this centers around the mason's, a group i don't really care much about and certainly don't fear as a conspiracy of any kind.	1
	most of brown's books grab and hold me and i care about the characters.	1
	i had a lot of trouble caring what happened to any of the characters in this book.	1
	the writing is on a par with ian fleming's early work and just as silly.	1
	the evil is evil, pure and simple, but the good is unclear.	1
	some have called this formulaic and that is pretty accurate.	1
	the da vinci code was a good read, of not a great one, and it held me all the way through.	1
	the lost symbol meanders around and is vague about so many things, including 'why should anyone care about this stuff?'	1
	the global threat makes no sense because real life is even sillier than this plot.	1
	i put it in the summer reading class.	1
	it's too bad it didn't come out at the beginning of the summer as it is a good beach read, nothing more.      	1
	couldn't put it down.wow, some of these reviews are absolutely brutal!	1
	this is not one of them.	1
	i'm not a fan of fiction in general.	1
	however, i enjoy dan brown's novels because they interlace history, religion, and story together.	1
	i was quite entertained and couldn't put the book down.	1
	although it was easy to see where the story was headed, i enjoyed the journey.	1
	i think that some of the reviewers here expect too much from a novel!	1
	this is entertainment, folks...      	1
	first 80% was good...then, seemed to go on forever....pager turner until about 80%.	1
	loved the plot, suspense.	1
	after a shocker (which i loved) the story took a nose dive.	1
	re-hashing all the conversations about ancient mysteries that took place earlier in the book.	1
	very preachy about this theme at the end and i had really had enough.	1
	felt like running a long, boring marathon to get to the end with no real worth to show for it.	1
	the story could have ended shortly after the twist...worth borrowing, don't feel obligated to finish the story...there's nothing really worth the wait at the end.	1
	much ado about nothing.      	1
	just so-so ....while entertaining, this story didn't seem as compelling as a&d; or even dvc.	1
	the sidebar storytelling/history lessons seemed to drag on needlessly.	1
	even though this was part fiction, part factual-based with conspiracy theory twists, dan brown seemed to have 'sold out' a bit in making this a 'for movie' type of book.	1
	this story didn't seem to have much substance and suspense timing (as in his the two previous langdon adventures); it felt rushed ... as if he was forced to put something down on paper to conclude a thought or scene.	1
	it also seemed that dan brown was either trying to appease the church or putting just enough out there only to end his point with a contraction.	1
	without giving away too much in the story, when the story really got going, there was a very unbelievable part on their way to mal'kah's house ... overall, a decent read.	1
	if you've read the other two langdon books, ya' have to give this one a try.	1
	p.s., props to iphone & tweets were interesting too.	1
	p.p.s, i didn't understand why the author/publisher chose not to support the kindle's text-to-speech capability.	1
	although, it did appear that the pictures were the same as the printed copy.      	1
	mindless fun, if not taken too seriously.the lost symbol is like a summer blockbuster movie...don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time reading it.	1
	yes, the writing is poor at times, and the main character langdon goes from being the smartest guy in the room to completely clueless too many times to count.	1
	i found the 'national security crisis' that required the involvement of the cia to be laughable...and unnecessary.	1
	i can tell that brown is trying very hard to be a serious writer, but his tendency to lecture to his audience is one of his great weaknesses.	1
	read this for fun, read this for pleasure, but don't expect much more than cheap entertainment.         	1
	disappointing.i purchased this book believing it would be as good as angels & demons or the da vinci code.	1
	i was wrong.	1
	for a harvard professor with a specialty in sympolism robert langdon is becoming more & more ignorant.	1
	he knows symbols yes, but in the book...he comes up with so many 'duhh' moments that i was really thrown off.	1
	especially since this book is set in our country's national capitol of washington, d. c.the characterizations are good, a family's turmoil & the security of our national heritage are good themes, but there is no real cohesion, many of the chapters are short paragraphs, it reads as if it wasn't edited, there is so much going on that the book runs back & forth between at least 3 different parts of the story, and more at times.	1
	there is tension between the extremely smart adversary & the characters involved, we don't know if the cia is with us or against us until near the last 1/4 of the book.	1
	forget the d.c. police here, they're not in the same league as the adversary.the end before the very end is a shocker & that saved the read for me.	1
	two endings.	1
	smart.if you like conspiracy theories, masonic rituals, symbolism, founding fathers philosophy, knowledge of the ancients..then maybe you'll enjoy this book.	1
	i just couldn't wrap my head around how bizarre the whole thing was and i'd really like a picture of how the adversary looked.	1
	the description was thorough, but he kept saying he is a work of art, an almost perfect symbol.	1
	maybe the movie will show it....      	1
	the albrecht durer code.the lost symbol might as well have been called the albrecht durer code (though that doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well).	1
	it follows the same tired and true formula that made dan brown filthy rich with his previous thriller---including many of the same flaws, but often even worse.	1
	there are too many such flaws to go into specifics, so i'll just discuss a few in general terms.	1
	for starters, the plot is surprisingly predictable, despite some glaring holes calculated to accommodate what are supposed to be shocking twists.	1
	also, despite having obviously done loads of research, brown sometimes gets his facts wrong---whether he deliberately distorts them to suit his purposes and hopes the reader won't notice, or whether he just flubbed it, it's difficult to tell.	1
	then there is the ridiculous pseudo-scientific premise, which is far more wildly implausible than that of the da vinci code.	1
	brown basically buys into, and propagandizes for, a new age interpretation of every brand of mysticism in history he comes across---faith healing, astral projection, the deepak chopra interpretation of quantum mechanics, and on and on.	1
	but he claims (quite falsely, i assure you) that these are not new age ideas, but real cutting-edge science.	1
	if you can somehow manage to suspend your disbelief about all this nonsense, there are a few exciting scenes buried in the middle of the novel, and some interesting characters (too many of whom meet untimely ends).	1
	but the ending returns to bad platonic and other varieties of mystical philosophy, and is pretty much just disappointing.	1
	the denouement goes on way too long, and the sorts of 'scientific' experiments brown describes as supposedly proving all this are laughably bad (rather than 'conclusive and irrefutable' as he claims they would be), as are the arguments put forth to show that the bible (as well as the scriptures of other religions) contain scientific wisdom beyond modern understanding (but that 'our science may one day catch up with the wisdom of the ancients').	1
	then there is the theme, namely that the truth (or at least dan brown's incredibly misguided version of it) must be kept hidden from the masses by a self-appointed elite.	1
	this is perhaps the most offensive element of the book.	1
	but most of brown's readers are probably not the sort who think too much about the novel's philosophical underpinnings, so brown can spill his guts about it and not worry too much about those masses (who comprise his readership) catching on.	1
	bottom line: if you liked the da vinci code, you will probably enjoy this; if not, don't bother.      	1
	really terrible book.let's be clear about this book.	1
	it's science fiction just like digital fortress and deception point.	1
	it is not just a work of fiction!	1
	noetics is not science.	1
	they have no published results in any peer-reviewed scientific journal.	1
	there was very little about computers or cryptography that was even remotely correct in digital fortress.	1
	advice to the authjor:  do a little research.	1
	it won't kill you!	1
	people like to use the word science without understanding what science is.	1
	this reminds me of the intelligent design crowd trying to publish non-scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals and name-dropping the word science just to confuse everyone and maybe get prayer and creationism back in schools.	1
	people like ben stein!	1
	i'm tired of non-scientific people thinking that dr frankenstein at the controls of some dorky contraption means science.	1
	as a mathematician and formerly an engineer i think i understand the definition of the word science.	1
	funny how people enjoy the technology, the drugs, and medicine but still believe in all the hocus pocus.	1
	enough said about that.	1
	this book is terrible and almost unreadable.	1
	i put it down twice and then decided to give up the third time when peter killed his son.	1
	it was at this point that i realize the book was probably over.	1
	dan brown is not a great writer.	1
	good maybe but not great.	1
	i can't believe they published the book.	1
	i guess it does not take much to entertain the american brain these days.	1
	having said all this, i will say i did enjoy the da vinci code as a work of fiction.	1
	although it is similar in style to the other books it is about more artist and historical aspects of our world.	1
	since i reject the bible as a literal book about a real god i had no problem with his conclusions.	1
	however, it is not one of the better books i have read over the years.      	1
	good pacing, inexcusable absurdities.dan brown does suspense pretty well.	1
	even as i was rolling my eyes at many of the absurdities or poorly researched parts of the book, it kept me turning the pages.	1
	just for that, this book gets a 'good' rating.	1
	as a quick aside, robert langdon is a terrible protagonist.	1
	i feel no connection to him whatsoever.	1
	when he does show brief glimmers of personality, he just seems elitist and stuffy.	1
	in this book particularly, he is swept along entirely passively and one never gets the feeling he has any impact in driving the plot forward.	1
	the dialogue was either ridiculously cliche or laboriously pedantic.	1
	people just simply don't talk in real life as they talk in this book, which suggests to me that brown was thinking more about the inevitable movie adaptation instead of just writing realistic dialogue.	1
	the handling of the cia was laughably bad, coming off more as a network serial handling of the intelligence community than anything reflecting real life.	1
	firstly, cia agents don't wander into places broadcasting their affiliation.	1
	secondly, they don't use cell phones to talk about things of 'the highest classification.'	1
	they don't threaten people with 'cia inquisitions' and they don't pull rank on capitol police.	1
	brown's mishandling of this just seems lazy.	1
	if anything, fbi involvement would have been more appropriate, since they have some amount of domestic jurisdiction.	1
	finally, this book was largely just repackaged ba'hai, which is essentially repackaged secular humanism.	1
	there is nothing new or mysterious or powerful about the concept of man using himself as a foundation upon which to build, autonomous from god.	1
	only people entirely unfamiliar with the bible or the koran could say that 'they both basically teach the same thing.'	1
	contextually, literally, metaphorically and morally they do not teach the same thing whatsoever - they teach very different things about the world, god, and man's relationship to god - therefore winding up at very different intellectual end points.	1
	the idea of synthesis of religions into one concept about god defies the first rule of logic (a cannot be non-a at the same time and in the same relationship) and is basically laughable.	1
	that said, i still give this book 3 stars because dan brown is an excellent suspense writer.	1
	he paces his books well and as long as you can just suspend your disbelief over some of the more egregious absurdities, it is an enjoyable book.      	1
	very disappointing.....what should i say?	1
	i'm a great fan of dan browns earlier books 'the da vinci code' or 'demons & angels'.	1
	after the long break and the long delay of his new novel, i was very excited to get a copy.	1
	the beginning was very promising, but the longer i read the more disappointed i got.	1
	i'm wondering what this book was all about?	1
	what happened in this more than 500 pages?	1
	in my opinion, really not much.	1
	the story was boring.	1
	you can read about the freemasons or the ancient mysteries or the lost word, the apotheosis of washington, the masonic pyramid etc.	1
	but what's the hype of all this?	1
	are those topics really so famous?	1
	i'm sorry, but before this book, i have never heard anything about any freemasons.	1
	so it was a book which covered broadly unknown topics to most people.	1
	another bad idea was, that the story took place in washington or below the washington monument.	1
	the washington monument for example was built around 1850. that's really not very old, at least if you compare it with rome for example, where his former books took place.	1
	but in the story, you can read about 'the man's most advanced intentions and man's most ancient ideas'.	1
	it seems that the origin of all this was buried below the washington monument.	1
	i was also not very glad about the chosen words.	1
	you can always read about 'the most....of all....', 'the most ancient ... of mankind...', 'the most terrifying view of all', etc....   and when i thought that everything was told and the story will be over in a minute, katherine came forward with a really 'astonishing remark': 'there's something important i want to tell you, robert.	1
	there's another piece to all this... a piece that i believe is the single most astonishing aspect of my research.'	1
	(remark: you see, one of the many exaggerations in the book...).	1
	all i thought at that moment was exactly what robert langdon answered in the book: 'there's more?'	1
	the whole book, i waited for something special to happen.	1
	but suddenly, i was at page 500 and nothing really special happened.	1
	i'm sorry, but the next time, i will at first read many reviews before buying another book of dan brown!	1
	my only conclusion to this book is: waste of money and waste of time!!	1
	!      	1
	disbelief, proof, and running: the novel..see jason lee's review.	1
	it was spot on, especially where he details the charactor exchanges.	1
	this book was 500 pages of langdon the skeptic and claustrophobic, being told/shown 'truths' by a handful on uninteresting charactors.	1
	i appreciated the science element in angels & demons, and the historical element to da vinci code, but this merger of the two just seemed a like an unneccesary and poorly told revisit to old themes.	1
	dan brown even throws in a few 'memories' of past novels' exploits.	1
	there were so many times i wanted to put down the book for good and just it give up, but since i really liked dan brown's other novels i felt like i should at least see it through--what if it really all came together in the end??	1
	for me, it did not.	1
	yes, he tied up all of his plot but not enough to save this mess of christian/masonic/historical fiction.	1
	maybe this genre is just overdone at this point?	1
	when it comes to dan brown i'm not looking for a great literary masterpiece, but this seemed more like an english comp 101 student's attempt to break into the bestseller market.	1
	'and then we went here.	1
	and then we went there.	1
	and then there was a twist!!	1
	and a new charactor!	1
	and a breakthrough!	1
	and then we ran here!	1
	which led us to there!'	1
	five.	1
	hundred.	1
	pages.	1
	one hundred and thirty-three chapters.	1
	of that.	1
	and honestly, most of it could easily have been deleted.	1
	about halfway through i had the following thoughts: 1) in this economy, they inflated the text so that people would feel more comfortable dropping $20-$30 on the hardcover.	1
	after all, spending that much on a 200-pg piece of fiction that lasts two days doesn't add up quite like dropping the same amount on a 500 pg book that should take up a week.	1
	unfortunately, most of the chapters are only 2-5 pages, sometimes with the last page being almost entirely blank.	1
	as a graphic designer i appreciate white space, but i literally couldn't get past the thought that half the content was superfluous and could have been removed without any harm to the story.	1
	2) this seemed like some of his research from angels & demons and some of his research from da vinci code merged together to make a 'new' story.	1
	unfortunately, he took some of the things i hated from each and really ran with them (crazed albino monk?	1
	meet mal'akh.	1
	pseudoscience meets historical fiction?	1
	atomic research, meet noetic science.	1
	and then there are the charactors who aren't what they seem...) same story, different time/place/charactors.	1
	3) did any one else notice that the love interests in the previous books disappear with no note of where they went?	1
	apparently an award-winning and adventurous scientist wasn't good enough for langdon, nor was a beautiful and direct descendant of jesus christ??	1
	4) seems like brown was trying to 'humanize' langdon by introducing his weaknesses and faults.	1
	however, i found him a little trying in this one.	1
	don't even get me started on some of the other charactors.	1
	there were a few i thought were downright crazed.	1
	and i'm not just talking about the villain.	1
	5) if you're reading this on the train, or metro, and you can only do a little bit at a time, you're in luck.	1
	the story jumps around every 2 pages or so to a different place/charactor.	1
	but not to worry, because when you encounter that charactor again in 5 pages, brown will restate where you left off.	1
	if you are reading straight through during a long stretch, it's repetitive.	1
	if you're using this as an airport-read/commute-read to toss in your briefcase, or as a beach-read when out with friends, or as a few pages a frantic mom manages to get to herself sporadically, then this could be great.	1
	that's why i'm giving it two stars, because it serves it's purpose as a time passer and stress releaser.	1
	just make sure you check it out from the library or pick it up used for $4.	1
	it's not worth more than that.      	1
	a total waste of time.in just a few short sentences, please allow me to express that this book was just plain garbage.	1
	from a subject perspective - not interesting.	1
	from a style perspective - elementary (it reads like a high school student wrote this).	1
	the tension in the book - based solely on mcguffins - if you can believe that!	1
	the characters - somehow are all unintelligent.	1
	not only unintelligent, but stubborn and irrational as well.	1
	the plot was also unbelievable and on the border of insulting.	1
	for example, we're expected to believe that a character can attack a cia director, with a weapon, and assist in the escape of a suspect, resist arrest, and a few chapters later become a part of the team (with said cia director) to help solve a national crisis (which, incidentally, is the release of a video to the news)!	1
	in another act of incredulity, we're expected to believe that after a man is held captive for days, gets his hand chopped off, witnesses several attempted murders and the death of a loved one, and once said man is freed, he will casually travel around the city imparting lessons of wisdom and marvels to another man (who died of drowning hours earlier but was revived because he drowned in miracle fluid).	1
	pure rubbish.	1
	i found myself rolling my eyes and saying 'aw, come on!'	1
	so many times throughout this book.	1
	if you value your time, and expect for authors to respect your sensibilities, don't go near this one.      	1
	feels like history textbook.i really enjoyed angels & demons, as well as the da vinci code.	1
	i do not mind that his writing style lacks any sense of style or complexity.	1
	however, while reading this book, at times i felt like dan brown was hammering me over the head with his points.	1
	i won't spoil anything - but one twist involving the villains past - is so heavily telegraphed that i didn't need to wait until 300 pages later for it to be revealed.	1
	further, the fast pace of dan brown's previous books is completely lost here.	1
	the book meanders in history lectures for long segments - and they completely interrupt the pacing.	1
	the one saving grace of this book - the information about washington dc is fascinating.	1
	dan brown knows how to conduct research and i learned a lot about where i live.	1
	so to summarize, here's the basic weaknesses and strengths of this book     thrill level:   weak - the final 'secret' is disappointing and i never really much cared about the mystery because it seemed too far-fetched.	1
	langdon acts like a big wet blanked throughout the story - insisting that the legend is false.	1
	and another problem - the impending 'disaster' that the villain plans to concoct - when that was revealed i felt cheated - because it was quite tame.	1
	worse things happen during one episode of '24' than this 'disaster.'	1
	background facts:  strong - dan brown weaves together an interesting portait of washington's secrets, geography, and history.	1
	his information about the secret societies was interesting as well - however it truly felt silly to read about 'noetic science' as if it were something were a serious discipline.	1
	length:  weak - as others have indicated, whoever dan brown hired as his editor should be ashamed of him/herself.	1
	this book was entirely too long, with whole chapters that felt unnecessary.	1
	for example, the first 80 pages seemed to be an extended prologue, in order to introduce each character, and 'noetic science'.	1
	and the final 60 pages seems to drone on for far too long.	1
	and in the middle, we are given far too much background story on solomon's past.	1
	brown seems to think his readers are quite stupid, and that each character's past needs to be hammered over & over again.	1
	characters:  medium - langdon doesn't seem to be as active as a character in this book.	1
	he solves a few puzzles here and there, but much of the book is devoted to following the villain and a couple side characters.	1
	the villain is comically evil, but that's okay because it builds on the mystery of his motivation.	1
	the standard dan brown 'beautiful but brilliant woman' serves her purpose as expected, though the character is fairly superficial.	1
	puzzles:  strong - the puzzles that langdon does solve along the way are interesting, and they stimulate the reader to continue along to find the solutions.	1
	however as stated previously, the last solution is so blaise that the journey feels anticlimatic.	1
	overall, the book is a mess.	1
	it has some promise if someone could eliminate about 200 pages from it - however even without those 200 pages there are still inherent weaknesses.	1
	i recommend spending your time on a different book.	1
	pick up a book on the masonic history of dc and you'll get the best of what this book offers. 	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown.i enjoyed the lost symbol -- maybe because i read it at a time when an uncomplicated, and yet intriguing story was a pleasant distraction from everyday stress.	1
	it's an easy read, fast-paced and engaging with lots of interesting possibilities to contemplate.	1
	i consider 3 stars to be a 'good' rating; and 4 stars to be a 'very good' rating.	1
	a book would have to be 'exceptional' to get 5 stars from me. 	1
	it's a dan brown novel- either you love them or you hate them.the lost symbol is the follow-up to dan brown's blockbuster, the davinci code.	1
	coming on the heels of the movie version of brown's angels and demons, it's little wonder so many readers have robert langdon on the brain nowadays.	1
	as in previous novels, robert langdon works 'against the clock' to unravel a complex puzzle.	1
	there is symbology, history, science, architecture, and ancient brotherhoods aplenty.	1
	brown fans will find this to be familiar territory.	1
	the locale is not exotic, but is set in washington d.c., which in no way detracts from the story.	1
	what i like about dan brown novels is the fact that brown infuses his story with mystery, and he knows how to peel back the layers of intrigue at a pace that titillates the reader without ever giving away too much at one time.	1
	the twists are few and unsurprising compared to brown's previous works, but they are present, and add a little bit to the story.	1
	what i enjoyed the most about the lost symbol is that every time you think you've gotten to the 'the big reveal', there's more.	1
	a few times toward the end of the book, i found myself noting the number of pages remaining, and wondered what story there was left to tell.	1
	the negatives of this novel are relatively few, but they are there.	1
	the pacing is much too slow in many places.	1
	the revelations at the end of the novel are too long and too preachy.	1
	i accidentally turned two pages at one point, and the same character was still talking.	1
	i didn't notice until several minutes later, and when i went back and read the pages i skipped, i discovered i really hadn't missed anything.	1
	perhaps mr. brown has achieved enough clout that he is exempt from much editing.	1
	there are also some glaring continuity errors and errors in logic.	1
	in one scene, langdon uses his cell phone to call the sister of an old friend on her own cellphone.	1
	several pages later, the sister decides to make a dangerous trek to a different location so that she can look up langdon's phone number, because she hasn't had it in years.	1
	hello?	1
	punch up 'received calls' on your cell phone?	1
	overall, the lost symbol is exactly what one should expect from dan brown, so it's very much a matter of perspective.	1
	i personally would give it 3 1/2 stars if halves were possible.	1
	if you enjoy the measured pacing of a mystery/thriller with a rich historical subtext, you will love it.	1
	if you prefer the adrenaline-packed thrill ride of a matthew reilly novel, you will hate it.	1
	read at your own risk.      	1
	entertaining read.the book follows his previous work in that it provides interesting factual information weaved into the story.	1
	the result is a book that is a page turner and you are rewarded with a few bits of knowledge that you get to keep.	1
	the only criticism i would have is that the story ended about 100 pages before the book did.	1
	the last part could have been left out of the story entirely or included in an epilogue for those who would be interested in a few more interesting factoids and philosophical ideas.	1
	so far dan has used the his knowledge and imagination about the masons and the templars to write two wonderful books, i look forward to any future books... maybe involving the sumarian's?	1
	or other ancient civilization as a natural progression to his writing style and interest.       	1
	needed a better editor.i've enjoyed all four of brown's prior novels and while i enjoyed 'the lost symbol,' it's definitely his weakest effort to date and a bit of a disappointment after the long wait.	1
	the book moves along at a decent clip and is nearly always engaging.	1
	despite some unnecessarily complex syntax, brown is an immensely readable author, and the book definitely had me pining for a trip to washington.	1
	one of my biggest problems with the book is that it lacks the grand scope, or at least the perpetual forward motion, of his earlier novels.	1
	without giving too much away, the plot here involves a single artifact uncovered early in the book that leads to very little payoff.	1
	when taken as a whole, great sections of the book seem to be more about spinning wheels than moving toward the conclusion.	1
	brown also sets up characters, locations and objects as significant but barely follows through with their resolutions on several occasions.	1
	that said, landon is entertaining as always, and i like how brown is such an academic that he thinks a professor would get 'wild applause' after a lecture on freemasonry.	1
	unfortunately, as mentioned in some of the other reviews, langdon doesn't do much in this book, and even langdon himself says as much.	1
	because katherine is an intellectual match, langdon doesn't have to carry the investigation and basically does nothing in the last half of the book.	1
	despite these flaws, i would have rated the book at least 3.5 stars, maybe 4, as a fun read if not for the terrible rambling conclusion.	1
	i'm not sure what brown was thinking by dragging his book a full fifty pages past its climactic resolution (that's 10% of the book in case you're counting) but i nearly stopped reading.	1
	the end of this is preachy and often eye-rolling and left me pining for the final page.	1
	luckily, the last few pages are significantly better than most of the conclusion.	1
	all in all, 'the lost symbol' is a passable effort from brown but not as satisfying as his earlier work or other recent best-selling thrillers.	1
	and i expect brown can thank his last-act rambling for much of the ill-will toward this book.	1
	lost.like all great and good fiction, the dance between truth and the lie is quite a delicate one.	1
	in the hands of a master, it's swan lake, but in the hands of a rank amateur, it's nothing more than prom night.	1
	dan brown's the di vinci code was swan, no question about it, for its intricate plot - although linear, as any good thriller must be - evolved as the secrets of the church, both true and otherwise, were revealed.	1
	the end result was something of an heretofore undiscovered promulgation of the vatican.	1
	by comparison, the lost symbol is, indeed, the fumblings of the prom night set.	1
	its plot attempts to capture that magical dance di vinci had but fails, dismally, because the protagonist, robert langdon, is little more than a foil for the oft cliche secret world of peter solomon.	1
	solomon, billionaire philanthropist as well as the highest ranking member of the masons, is captured by the antagonist.	1
	mal'akh is a borderline between human and monster whose lifelong quest for the talisman he believes will open the gateway to the secrets his survival requires; of course, the gateway provides for his demise, the classic - if not stock - scenario of his archetype.	1
	but mal'akh's survival is not at the expense of the protagonist (langdon), as it should be, but at peter solomon's, which only further enhances langdon's prosaicism.	1
	while brown attempts the dance he so beautifully executed through his protagonist in di vinci, symbol's robert langdon plays the disbelieving fool whose organic intellect haphazardly carries him through the plot to a rather unsatisfying (and unreasonable) end.	1
	simply put, the robert langdon of symbol is the idiot brother of di vinci's robert langdon.	1
	brown is so surprisingly inept at his craft in this novel that all of his characters - save one - are reduced to vapid, homogenized stereotypes.	1
	we can, for example, see the zipper of his monster; mal'akh has all of the vibrato of frankenstein without any of the solicitous empathy.	1
	katherine solomon, peter solomon's sister and famous noetic scientist, is equally as impotent as langdon, himself; instead of being langdon's trusty sidekick where her knowledge of noetic science is able to provide certain crucial answers that langdon's field of symbology cannot, both she and her world of noetic science remains to the end a complete mystery.	1
	the only genuine character in the novel is sato, the dwarfish troll, chain-smoking director of cia operations who is the only clear patch in the otherwise hyperbolic storyline.	1
	here, brown gets it right - almost.	1
	with sato, brown creates a believably unreliable character; the reader is somewhat concerned which side she's really playing.	1
	but it's all for naught as the book is really nothing more than a symbol of failure.      	1
	very so-so.i am about 3/4 finished reading this book; i may never complete it.	1
	i am very disappointed, i waited for it to be published, purchased it asap, hoarded it, putting off starting it to savor a great read.	1
	it is boring, what else can i say?	1
	a weirdo run amok l just gets to be too much.	1
	why doesn't someone just kill the 'evil one' and put him out of his ego driven misery?	1
	covered with tattoos,  he 'hides' them on his head with makeup, come onnnnn, that's ridiculous.	1
	all the other mumbo-jumbo just makes it easy to put down hoping it will get better...but it doesn't.	1
	that's it for me!	1
	my red knob popped up, i'm done with it.	1
	done like a turkey.      	1
	it couldn't be worse.i honestly don't understand why this book isn't getting even worse reviews than it is.	1
	i thought dan brown's davinci code was okay, and i enjoyed angels and demons (i haven't seen either of the movies because i prefer the depth of a novel).	1
	so i was looking forward to his latest book, the lost symbol.	1
	what a disappointment.	1
	i bought the hardcover for my wife, but i listened to the audio book.	1
	eventually the only way i was able to get through all of its lectures and utter nonsense was on double speed on my iphone.	1
	in trying to think how to describe the book's problems, i found it hard to come up with anything i liked about it.	1
	what i did come up with was a list: how to write like dan brown    1. start with an idea for a 20 page short story.	1
	2. turn it into a novel.	1
	3. label every scene as a chapter.	1
	4. use the viewpoint of every living thing in washington (don't overlook bums, pets and inanimate objects as possibilities).	1
	5. describe everything at least 5 times.	1
	6. end each of the two hundred chapters with a melodramatic cliff hanger.	1
	7. recap the entire situation at the beginning of every chapter.	1
	8. stop in the middle of all action sequences for a five page lecture.	1
	9. hire wile e. coyote as your science adviser.	1
	10. sell the movie rights for $10m.	1
	that last one is the one that bugs me the most.	1
	with all the terrific books out there, it's sad that this one is certain to be turned into a movie, and make more money that all of this year's best sellers combined.	1
	the book is actually already written like a movie script, more a collection of dramatic beats than a real story.	1
	you can almost here the dun dun dun at the end of each of the 136 chapters.	1
	if you insist on finding out how bad the lost symbol is for yourself, at least wait until you can pick up a used copy for 1 cent.	1
	there will be lots of them.      	1
	meh..it is what it is and as a writer dan brown is dan brown.	1
	i don't want to fall into describing what the book isn't, or what dan brown as a writer isn't, as so many media reviewers do with brown.	1
	no one will call him a dazzling prose stylist.	1
	it is an interesting summer or airplane read and is certainly swiftly paced.	1
	however, for a book based on so much action, it is remarkably static.	1
	whether purposeful or not, the plot twists and ending were fairly predictable early in the book.	1
	it is obviously deeply researched and once again on a topic dan brown has a real passion for.	1
	the book is an entertainment, and on that point it succeeds, but it is just an entertainment.      	1
	not bad.parts of the book stand up to what you expect from dan brown.	1
	other parts seemed contrived.	1
	the beginning was slower than his other langdon adventures, and the ending seemed much more pointless (and, as a non-deist, potentially a mite offensive).	1
	the identity of the villain was evident only about a quarter of the way through the book, so for brown to continually try to 'trick' the reader until the other characters were ready to discover his identity just seemed disingenuous.	1
	not a bad adventure--but not brown's best work.      	1
	don't buy it, get it from the library for free.i really like the rest of dan brown's books, but this one was not worth the money my boyfriend paid for it.	1
	it took me, a rather quick reader, over a month to finish.	1
	i'd pick it up, read a (2-3 page) chapter, then put it down again.	1
	there really was no point of having noetic science play a part in the story-it never mattered in the end.	1
	why even discuss it?	1
	any intrigue brown tried to put into the story was worthless in the end.	1
	i'm still not quite sure what the lost symbol was supposed to be.	1
	to me, this story dragged on, and the end was quite the let down.	1
	at times it was very farfetched.	1
	i suggest you get it from the library instead of wasting your money on buying this book.      	1
	dust off your library card.	1
	(sorry amazon).i can't give 1 star to a book that kept me turning its pages but it's tempting.	1
	mr. brown is a good plot craftsman but a terrible writer.	1
	he doesn't trust his reader to remember a character's thoughts for more than a page or two so he repeats details to help us connect the dots.	1
	little if any of the dialog reads like anything a person might actually say with lots of uninterrupted exposition bogging things down.	1
	when katherine answers robert's initial phone call i thought we might see some fun, sexy banter (maybe a relationship?)	1
	but it was downhill from there.	1
	this is not a book you'll want to read twice so dust off your library card, put your name on a 'request' list and wait until it comes in.        	1
	predictable and disappointing.this book was entirely too long.	1
	it was like a docu-drama that builds up to an amazing revelation only to then cut to commercial.	1
	i found myself highly irritated by the flow of the story.	1
	i was expecting something really thought provoking to be unveiled at the end but it was a big let-down.	1
	i also found this book to be very predictable.	1
	i figured out the true identity of the villain early on in the story.	1
	i also figured out several of the puzzles that were so perplexing to old robert langston... uh... just turn it upside-down.	1
	i felt it was a waste of my time.	1
	i'd suggest skipping it and re-reading the da vinci code or angles and demons.                	1
	wait for a used paperback.i am not sorry i bought this first edition, but the lost symbol is not up to par with angels & demons and the davinci code.	1
	coming from a masonic family, there is way too much speculation and downright false information about the freemasons.	1
	the book was maybe 200 pages too much, and i became bored waiting for the real ending.	1
	i very rarely just stop reading a book, but i closed this one with about 60 pages to go, never to open again.	1
	my interest was totally gone, and i don't care what else the author had to say.	1
	i should have stopped reading with at least 100+ pages to go!      	1
	worst ending i've ever read.while i was drawn forward through most of the book and enjoyed the interwoven history lesson on dc, brown seems to have taken leave of his senses by the end of this book.	1
	i can forgive the convenient plot twists and the 'miracle occurs' solutions, characteristic of his other books, but i can't forgive the descent into what i can only call a mind-crushingly trite and cop-out ending.	1
	i was actually so angry as i neared the end that i could barely finish.	1
	the final few chapters read like an amalgam of timothy leary and l. ron hubbard, with an overlay of smarmy patriotism that defies belief.	1
	as others point it, the book reads more like a screenplay, but i'm hard pressed to believe that this ending is filmable.	1
	i don't think i've read a worse ending in my entire life.      	1
	pseudo-history and junk science...together again!.as a rule, i usually do not read novels but considering the hype and the subject matter of mr. brown's latest novel, i forced myself to read it.	1
	if you've seen the movies or read the books 'angels and demons' or 'the davinci code', simply take all the pseudo-history and junk science and transport it to washington d.c. instead of rome or paris, and you get this book.	1
	like mr. brown's previous works, this novel strains the readers' credulity until you're halfway through the book and at the point you might as well finish it.	1
	on the other hand, if not for mr. brown's work this decade, the publishing business might not be where it is right now, so for that, the author deserves respect for resurrecting a moribund industry.	1
	overall, if you like dan brown, you are going to like this book.	1
	serious readers, stay away and you will be much better for it.           	1
	irritated and bored!.after reading dan brown's latest, the lost symbol, i described it to a friend as one of the most boring books that i have ever read.	1
	i realize that is harsh, but when the book is put forth as a thriller, there is no better description.	1
	while i didn't consider either the da vinci code or angels and demons as great literature, i enjoyed both for their entertainment value.	1
	this book left me completely cold in that regard.	1
	by the end, i was so tired of lectures and dissertations about symbols that i truly didn't care about what happened to any of the characters.	1
	the true action in the book ended many chapters before the final one, making them rather superfluous.	1
	i just wanted it to be over so i could close the cover and be done.	1
	this is not my usual experience with reading and certainly not with any book i regard as decent.	1
	for those who enjoyed dan brown's earlier bestsellers, forget this one!       	1
	ending disappointment.i just finished the lost symbol by dan brown, one of those writers who keep your interest.	1
	i have enjoyed his first four books immensely.	1
	i had a bad feeling about the fifth book before it was published.	1
	it took a long time to write.	1
	this often indicates that the book was laborious to write.	1
	when i write something about a subject, i like it to flow like a stream bolstered by major rainfall.	1
	the lost symbol did not flow out of dan brown's mind easily and smoothly.	1
	its gestation was more like a tough pregnancy ending with severe labor pains.	1
	the results were all the worse for the stretching and pushing to bring it to term and deliver it.	1
	after a mega-masterpiece like the da vinci code, the next book would have to meet very high standards to be favorably compared with its predecessor.	1
	pressure and great art sometimes do not go together.	1
	while purely fictional books like digital fortress, deception point and angels & demons were excellent, his success with the da vinci code, a book that blends credible and controversial historical events and 'what ifs' together with fiction, meant that his editors and his public would be looking for more of the same.	1
	this was apparently not a realistic expectation.	1
	the da vinci code was a one-time breakout novel with popularity matching or exceeding the masterpiece gone with the wind by margaret mitchell, the only novel she ever published.	1
	ms. mitchell knew publishing anything after that novel would just dim her historical achievement.	1
	dan brown probably felt the same pressure but financially found it an irresistible feat he would have to attempt.	1
	the lost code was over five hundred pages.	1
	the excellent writing style of dan brown compelled me to read the first four hundred pages with great excitement.	1
	these pages flew by in a two evening session.	1
	even at this point i felt there was no credible end game for his plot to top off the previous, intense action.	1
	unfortunately i was right.	1
	the last hundred pages were a chore to read.	1
	the last fifty pages were truly painful.	1
	the ending was disappointing.	1
	no revelations, no glorious wonderment, no historical impact was forthcoming.	1
	it lingered and died failing to take the reader to the same level as its predecessor.	1
	the attempt fell way short.	1
	it was not without some interesting moments.	1
	it did have its share of historical factoids.	1
	there will be some readers walking around washington dc to trace the monuments where the action took place.	1
	kudos to dan brown for the moments which made me want to hop aboard the washington metro and visit these places which i have ignored too long, living only five miles from the capital.	1
	at the end i was ready slip my metro pass into the 'maybe one day department' on my to-do list.	1
	the excitement vanished with the end of the novel.	1
	written for a movie rather than a reading audience.notwithstanding the repetitive text and the unnecessary length, this book is still entertaining as it lays out the twists and turns.	1
	however, it is written as though it's a screenplay in preparation.	1
	the writing is not up to par for a reading audience.	1
	plot-wise it keeps the reader thinking, but langdon himself appears less intelligent and incapable than in previous books.	1
	he is on the receiving end not only in the physical torture meted out but also in the information section - he is constantly being lectured to, particularly in the last third of the book.	1
	overall, a satisfactory follow-up to da vinci code but you could just skip it and wait for the movie.      	1
	good... until the end.as i began the newest release of dan brown, i was excited.	1
	i enjoyed all of his other books very much and was really looking forward to another great thrilling fiction novel.	1
	i was thoroughly disappointed at the end of the book.	1
	i knew the basic plot of the story about 1/3 of the way through (something i hate to experience) and to top it off, the last 2 chapters kind of ticked me off.	1
	there were several ways the book could have ended and to throw in another religious 'breakthrough', if you will, didn't sit too well with me.	1
	while i realize it is a work of fiction, it still wasn't what i was expecting or something i enjoyed reading.	1
	i think if he would have stopped a little bit sooner, i may have liked it... i do appreciate where he was going for the majority of the book but to end it the way he did... i don't know... it was just ok for me.      	1
	formulaic, annoying.whatever entertainment value this book offers is completely offset by dan brown's worn-out style of writing.	1
	if you've read his other works, you know what i'm referring to.	1
	that 'bad' guy that pops up in the first third of the book?	1
	they're definately going to end up helping our hero.	1
	the really evil character will always be involved in some plot twist that you never saw coming (only if, of course, you are literally blind).	1
	every chapter will involve a lecture on history or art, and robert langdon, in spite of 'recoiling in shock' and 'staring in amazement' through two previous novels involving explosive revelations, will always and forever deny any theory that any character proposes, only to be 'shocked' or 'dismayed' upon learning its truth ten pages later.	1
	also, the stupid cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter may have been effective the first time around dan, but four novels later they are just annoying.	1
	you spend all of your energy building suspense, only to leave us unsatisfied at the end of a chapter when you switch scenes.	1
	i think it would be much more effective if we didn't see conflict coming a mile away, and if you occasionally surprised us with something unexpected.	1
	i thought your previous langdon novels were extremely entertaining, and fun.	1
	while this novel serves its purpose (making money), i think you can do much better in the future.	1
	i would like to see you stray from your own formula.  	1
	the lost symbol.i was very dissappointed with this book.	1
	i only trully appreciatred angels and demons and the da vinci code, both deception point and digital fortress, and now the lost symbol were let downs for me.	1
	i thought since robert langdon was back in this book it was worth reading it.	1
	i was wrong.	1
	characters really lack development, the story is mainly boring and repetitive.	1
	i got to a point where i didn't even care if they killed the characters, langdon included.	1
	what dissapointed me the most was the end, i guess i didn't understand the whole symbolism of it... and i didn't even bother reading the final pages again to try and find out.	1
	im afraid at that point, i didn't care anymore.      	1
	good for campfire kindling.i plowed through brown's 'davinci code' and 'angels & demons'...great page turners both!	1
	which makes me sad to say the following: this much anticipated follow-up to the wildly successful davinci code was intermittently sleep-inducing, the characters never fully fleshed-out (i never gave a hoot about any of them), predictable from beginning to end...and, speaking of the end....phlbttt.phlbttt.phlbttt.	1
	unbelievably, spectacularly sophomoric dreck of a finale (this was, at least, consistent with the rest of the book).	1
	the research conducted, i'm sure, was a mountain of work...so kudos to whoever did that...but in terms of mr. brown spinning that research into something that resembled an intriguing, believable (or unbelievable in a good, science-fiction, way), page-turning story that i could buy into on any level or care about in the least...not so much.	1
	in fact, for this reader...not at all.	1
	it did feel as though there was an assignment given and, in lackluster fashion, completed.	1
	nothing more, nothing less.	1
	a complete and total waste of my time.       	1
	after da vinci code, very disappointing.robert langdon is fast losing his appeal as the leading character of this series.	1
	about two-thirds of the way through the book you just wish he would shut up and quit philosophizing and moralizing about every insignificant fact behind a symbol or a architectural flourish.	1
	i understand dan brown compiled a lot of research as he was writing this book, but he doesn't have to dump all of it on us.	1
	also, he has absolutely no role in the last 40 pages of the book.	1
	he just serves as a foil for the other major characters to tell him--what, exactly?	1
	i don't remember, because none of it seemed important or relevant.	1
	anyway, the characters are pretty stupid because they are all duped by one villain.	1
	he is able to get into the most secure places in the nation's capitol by impersonating others and improvising.	1
	he's supposed to be the incarnation of evil, but there's no depth to a characterization like that.	1
	the revelation at the end of his real identity is hard to swallow as well.	1
	once the book picks up pace (150 pages into it!	1
	), it doesn't take long to lose steam, and brown fills the book with unnecessary flashbacks, sometimes flashing back to a single event from multiple points of view.	1
	it bogs the story down and makes an already long read much too long.	1
	most of the book takes place over 8 hours, but it takes 20 hours to read it.	1
	there's something wrong with that.	1
	the stuff about noetics is interesting, but it doesn't seem to have any bearing whatsoever on the plot until the last 20 pages, and even then it's a stretch.	1
	when katherine spouts off for 10 pages about how every single human on earth is his own god and that's what ancient texts like the bible and the bhagavad gita are 'coded' to tell us, i wanted to throw the book down, but i was so close to the end i suffered through it.	1
	it's supposed to act as the great climactic revelation--like the offspring of jesus from the da vinci code--but it comes off as artificial and as prosleytizing.      	1
	what's wrong between mr. brown and water?.i don't want to talk of how disappointing i have found this book, other reviewers have done it pretty well.	1
	i just wonder what's wrong between the author and water.	1
	i mean, he keeps detailing on people drowning.	1
	one in angels and demons; one in deception point; two in this book.	1
	he must have some serious fears about it.	1
	ah, for those complaining about paying 16 dollars for this book, i have said good bye to 25 euro...to mr. brown: next time you need money, please just ask for it, instead of writing something this bad.	1
	p.s.	1
	amazon.com reviewlet's start with the question every dan brown fan wants answered: is the lost symbol as good as the da vinci code?	1
	simply put, yes.	1
	.........................      	1
	didn't i already read this?.i'm pretty sure i already read this story, oh right that was angels and demons...and then i read it again in davinci code, i also saw it on the big screen in national treasure, but that's a different issue altogether.	1
	repetition and self pllagerism aside brown has a real problem with writing about technologies he doesn't understand, and making really poor assumtions.	1
	dan, you don't understand firearms, you don't understand helicopters, you don't understand the internet, hire a damned consultant.	1
	it may seem petty, but it's distracting from the story when someone asks '...is this even possible' and the answer actually is 'yes, it's prefectly normal'.	1
	the problem with this book though is the actual plot, or lack thereof.	1
	langdon gets a phone call, launches into action, meets a genius but sexy woman, spends exactly one night running through a historical city with her, uncovering hidden mysteries only to find that someone at the end will tell him they knew the answer all along.	1
	in this case, after reading chapter 1 page 2, i literally thought 'i know where it's hidden'.	1
	at this point i didn't know what was hidden, or why, but i knew where it was going to be.	1
	that's how transparent the plot is.	1
	but it gets worse.	1
	you'll remember the bad guy from davinci code and angels and demons...not the same charecter, but it's the same mannerisms, same physical oddities, blah blah...and when they reveal his true identity you'll be confused.	1
	not confused because you don't get it, confused because you didn't realize it was supposed to be a secret.	1
	his identity is obvious within the first few pages of the book, painfully obvious.	1
	but there's always a saving grace in brown's books, the big secret revealed at the end.	1
	oops...the big secret, the item that is hidden that is far too powerful for mankind to be trusted with, turns out to be a metaphor and boringly mundane.	1
	not only that, but the item can't be physically revealed due to the location, requiring another charecter to explain to langdon what it is, where it is, why it's there...in other words, the whole story was a waste of time.	1
	there was no secret, nothing hidden, this guy knew everything all along, all you had to do was ask him.	1
	if you don't see dan brown's middle finger mocking you, then you weren't paying attention.      	1
	where is dan brown?.this is dan brown?	1
	where is the taught, energizing style?	1
	the truly interesting, conflicted characters?i am not going to be able to finish this book.	1
	it is slow, boring, and reads like something that was paid by the word so the author put as many words in as possible.i bought this book on my belief in brown's writing ability.	1
	never again.      	1
	similar plotlines, similar characters, a let down at the end.if you are a dan brown fan, you will find the book to be a page turner.	1
	for that, i give the author credit.	1
	no, it's not as good as the da vinci code but the book reads with the same kind of suspense and clue hunting.	1
	some notes - -the characters and situations are just too similar to the other langdon stories.	1
	you have the older friend of langdon's, a terrifying psycho, the woman companion - it's all the same.	1
	it's almost like taking the same characters and just writing a different story.	1
	-the deciphering of clues is not bad, but fails in comparison to davinci code.	1
	at times it can almost seem like a rip-off of the same type of clue finding.	1
	-there are a few major directions brown goes in, taking much time to explain it all, that end up not having anything to do with the plot -the ending, without giving it away, just leaves you with the sense of 'that's it?'	1
	i can't even begin to describe how much suspense and power that brown builds up in the story, only to let it fizzle out almost completely.	1
	as a reader i was left to feel very underwhelmed.	1
	-overall, the book was compelling and was an easy read.	1
	having finished it though, i'm just disappointed - kinda like a kid who gets promised a new bike for xmas but ends up getting a pair of socks instead.       	1
	horrid.the best thing about this book was reading the reviews and realizing that others hated it too.	1
	i did not read angels and demons but thought davinci was ok.  this one was given to me when i was ill and it made me feel even worse.	1
	badly written.	1
	pretentious.	1
	absurd characters.	1
	absolutely dreadful.	1
	one star is one too many.	1
	glad i didn't buy it and will not pass it on - to the landfill.	1
	written for the screen for sure.i have read all of dan browns books so far and this one just felt a little limp.	1
	it's not horrible but there are some issues for sure.	1
	with several small details that don't add up and professor robert langdons character feeling a bit inconsistent throughout it really ended up being a small let down for me.	1
	overall it was 'okay' but the story built up to a conclusion that didn't really seem to be all that important.	1
	more of just a fizzle at the end.	1
	it really felt like it was written with a movie producer hovering near by as well... 	1
	the ending is a huge letdown.i enjoyed dan brown's other books, but felt that this one was way too formulaic; it felt so similar in pattern to the davinci code that i was very put off.	1
	however, i kept reading and hoping for it to improve.	1
	as with his other books, i got caught up in the story of the power of that one insane individual who ends up controlling so many people and threatening so much danger.	1
	the rapid pace, intensity, and unknown dangers make you anticipate a spectacular ending, which you cannot imagine yourself, so you read as fast as you can to end the suspense.	1
	the problem is, dan brown could not imagine that ending, either.	1
	the letdown is huge.	1
	i don't think i'll be reading dan brown in the future.      	1
	please do not make this a movie.i'm a fan of his other books; all had great plots, page turners, the historical stuff was there, but the lost symbol took it too far.	1
	barely a plot...well its there but nothing that's not predictable.	1
	there's were parts that did not really play an important part in the overall story.	1
	landgon skeptisism was taken way to far, and why was repeated every few pages something to the effect i know you don't believe or open your mind.	1
	got quite old.	1
	to be honest, i lost interest, and the last few chapters i was skimming threw.	1
	a true dissappointment, and this is one of those books that will end up in the spring garage sale next year.	1
	and one more thing: please, please, please don't make this book a movie!!!	1
	!      	1
	symbol qua symbol.after looking forward to reading this book i must say i was very disappointed.	1
	the plot drags on without any real definition of characters and the villain is easily identifiable by the middle of the story.	1
	the ending is very weak and provides no real tangible meaningful resolution of the story.	1
	there are symbols of symbols of symbols but eventually too much boring data that sometimes have relevance to the characters and plot and often do not.	1
	the same novel could have been written in 290 pages not 500.   i could not recommend this effort but if you are really interested i would wait for the less expensive paperback edition.      	1
	two books - one boring, one exciting.finally!	1
	i finished reading 'the lost symbol'.	1
	somewhere between page 200 and 250, brown found his stride.	1
	the first half of the book read like a thesis.	1
	in the end, the mcguffin might well have come from a sampler found in a convent.	1
	at least from that point on, he took you on a typical dan brown ride with a surprise ending, which i might have seen coming if i weren't so tired of the preaching.	1
	also, i feel it was misnamed.	1
	the only things lost were lives, and they were not searching for a symbol.	1
	it might have been better named the hidden word or the forgotten word.	1
	there were times when i felt i was reading a rip-off of the national treasure movies, and other times it pained me to have to sit through another boring lecture.	1
	guess i just didn't like it!	1
	maybe the masons will like it.      	1
	stop the annoying suspense at the end of each chapter.i like dan brown's books as they are light and entertaining.	1
	what i deeply wish is that he stops this fake and annoying suspense that he tries to introduce at the end of each and every little chapter as he thinks he is engaging the reader by getting us to keep going in the book trying to find what happens.	1
	this works sometimes, but when it becomes a predictable 'fake suspense' stunt, it is annoying.	1
	here is a suggestion that i am certain will make dan the best fiction writer of all times, should he follow my idea: (suspense...), well you have to read my future comment to find out :)...      	1
	it took a while to get into.this book was so similar to his other books that i was disappointed.	1
	i must admit there was one twist i didn't see coming but the rest of the book was pretty much more of the same old same old.	1
	it was entertaining once i go into it and the lost symbol is a perfect long plane ride book.	1
	i can't sleep on planes so i often read a book or two on those grueling 10 hour plane rides.	1
	i'd definitely wait for the paperback.      	1
	expectations were 33 feet higher....i'm not sure it's safe to get to know robert langdon, the main character in the da vinci code, angels & demons, and this book.	1
	people around him suffer terrible mishaps.	1
	but when religious and mystical understanding is the result, perhaps it's okay.	1
	well, that about sums up the lost symbol!	1
	here's a recipe for this book: take a half dozen macabre deaths.	1
	mix with a desperately tight timeline.	1
	be astounded every time there is clarity regarding the meanings of symbols.	1
	leave all skepticism out.	1
	add the location of every step every character takes.	1
	this quackwatch-worthy book (noetic sciences... good grief, charlie brown!	1
	), with a poorly educated bad guy outwitting everyone, and severely injured and exsanguinated people never needing a rest, really requires the reader to leave disbelief behind.	1
	okay, on the positive side, you really want to know how it ends.	1
	rats!      	1
	big disappointment.dan brown is a very gifted writer who can make a mundane story suspenseful and keep the reader's interest.	1
	good thing---because this book lacks any substance and the main story is unclear.	1
	i was expecting all manner of intrigue about the free masons and there was none--a real disappointment.	1
	all we got was some synbolism in the washington monument and the u.s. capitol.	1
	maybe mr. brown received pressure from the masons not to write about them---if so, they were very successful.	1
	most of the book is about a guy named mal'akh whom i expected to unleash all manner of evil on the world.	1
	but his story just fizzled out about three-quarter way through the book and the rest of the book just meanders through the washington monument.	1
	not a thriller at all!      	1
	steaming pile ...!.i love dan brown's other books, angels & demons is my fav.	1
	so eager to read the lost symbol, espcially since i lived in dc, had toured some masonic temples and knew enough about the masons to have my interest peaked.	1
	and, i realize these are not classics nor award winners, but exciting and often educational reads (at least for me).	1
	book started out ok, liked the female lead character, family history, etc.	1
	but soon i found myself skipping entire needlessly long paragraphs about stuff i had already read about pages earlier.	1
	then the feeling hit that this is a screenplay for a blockbuster movie, not a novel.	1
	next, i stopped making making the reality-jump to accept that so many experts had so much knowledge at their fingertips to spew off at perfectly convenient moments, and how great it is to have students ask just the right questions so that more information can be fored in front of our eyes.	1
	about 2/3rd through, i completely stopped caring about the characters!	1
	and soon thereafter i couldn't believe the book kept on going, and going, and going, on and on, on and on, like some crazy mirror reflection trick - i kept saying 'just stop already!'	1
	if you want to read this - borrow it from a library or friend.	1
	dan brown ought to be ashamed to publish this steaming pile of you know what!        	1
	couldn't fully suspend disbelief.the lost symbol was similar to other books by dan brown with its fast pace and numerous twists and turns.	1
	i was unable, however, to get fully immersed in the story line; partly because i found it less interesting than his other books' plots, and partly becuase it was incredibly far fetched.	1
	as always it was an entertaining read, simply not as riveting as previous efforts.      	1
	a big disappointment.to say that this was a big disappointment is an understatement.	1
	this book is weak, meandering and contrived.	1
	it is clear that brown just wanted to make money.	1
	the book was boring.it made no sense, was not compelling in any way.	1
	i resented the time i spent reading it- hoping that perhaps it would eventually develop into something - it never did.      	1
	i couldn't even finish.i started this latest of dan brown's potboilers a few nights ago, but managed to get through only 30 or 40 pages of his poorly constructed work before snapping off my reader.	1
	having read two of brown's earlier novels, it was obvious that the author has chosen not to heed his critics and seek a more thorough editor.	1
	that is an unfortunate choice, as most of brown's problems are to do with technique than substance, and as a result all of those old problems are still present in the newest effort.	1
	it's often said that the best writers are those that break the rules, but it appears that dan brown has mistaken that to mean that authors are great because they broke the rules.	1
	this misapprehension in mind, brown has set out to break the most important rule in writing--'show, don't tell'--as flagrantly, and as often, as possible.	1
	in place of vivid description, brown awkwardly inserts numbers, brand names and statistics.	1
	character background is misused in the same way one might misuse pepper at the table: instead of sprinkling a bit in each course, all the pepper is dumped on the appetizer, and the flavor is expected to carry throughout the meal.	1
	when brown introduces a character, he will immediately divulge everything from jobs and motivations and religious affiliations to family trees and sexual histories.	1
	one is left to wonder, which bits, if any, is one expected to remember?	1
	the past offenses are not enough, however.	1
	brown is not one to rest on his laurels.	1
	he has managed to find one way to make his text even more irksome, and that's through pomposity.	1
	in an early scene, the protagonist robert langdon flashes back to a lecture he once gave on occult symbols.	1
	despite the fact that the audience is comprised wholly of harvard students, langdon has to lead them by the nose through each leap of logic, patting himself on the back each time.	1
	the passage borders on the masturbatory, especially when one considers that brown, by proxy of langdon, paints these harvard students as rubish, uncultured and slow.	1
	at this point, a reviewer generally wraps up by plainly stating his view of the product in question and closes with a recommendation to the shopper.	1
	however, having said so much already, i don't believe it's necessary to clear up my feelings about this book.	1
	read it if you want something to talk with a dim aunt about, but it's not worth much else.      	1
	such a dissapointment....after all the controversy surrounding the davinci code, which was a good read in my opinion, i was eagerly anticipating this follow up.	1
	i tore through it in less than 48 hours, and overall there was entertainment and enjoyment in the process of the reading, but overall i felt like it wasn't as worthwhile as when i read the davinci code, or even angels & demons (both of which i have reviewed here on amazon).	1
	i think what bothered me most was that the main villian's identity was easily discerned, so when the reveal occurred there was no 'aha' moment for me.	1
	the final conclusion was also a bit of a bore in my opinion.	1
	i am sure once the script writers in hollywood get their hands on this they will make it more thrilling than the overall experience of the reading was.	1
	until then, if you are a fan of the robert langdon character go ahead and give it a go.	1
	after all, reading a book is better than doing nothing at all. 	1
	an ok read, a bit disappointing follow up to dc.i have to agree with the other reviewers here.	1
	the book was overall an ok read, but nothing truly grabbing your attention to the book that you have to sit and read it.	1
	i anxiously got the book, and read as much as time would allow.	1
	getting into it, i figured out one main piece of the book very early on.	1
	not going to reveal any details, but i don't think i am smarter than anybody else here.	1
	it was a fairly blatant.	1
	in reality, this book could be under the political thriller category, but it is not thrilling, to be honest.	1
	the conclusion was...uninspired, to me.	1
	a long explanation that really is not earth shattering, and in reality, a bit of a downer.	1
	i waited for this?	1
	boy, my life is truly exciting.	1
	deja vue all over again.well, once again we have the clever, intrepid professor, his attractive female sidekick, a crazed, wacko religious freak, and a plethora of arcane symbols and mysteries stashed in various pyramids, buildings and books.	1
	although embrassingly smilar to the da vinci code, there are good characters and plot twists and surprises to hold one's interest.	1
	unfortunately there is an excess of weak science and tortured philosophy that may appeal to those who are gullible and deluded anough to believe in soul-weighing machines, telekinesis, and the power of collective thought.	1
	(hopefully al qaeda never figures out how to use the last one on us).	1
	as for the fantasy that there are ancient mysteries that would reveal profound knowledge about the universe and the human condition, the human endeavor called science reveals such mysteries on a daily basis.	1
	you don't have to seek them at the bottom of ancient stairways.	1
	you can read about them regularly in discover magazine.      	1
	wavering quality.an entertaining story and i didn't feel my time was wasted in reading this one.	1
	to make the inevitable - and perhaps unfair - comparison to brown's other two books i've read, this one did not compel me to sit long into the night and keep turning the pages in anticipation of what comes next.	1
	couldn't get over the sense that i was reading a novel written with the purpose of becoming a screenplay.	1
	the ending was weak and bizarre.	1
	ten hours of trauma that is followed up with a tour of washington dc in the dead of a cold winter night?	1
	strange and misplaced.	1
	nevertheless, as with brown's other novels, this one served its purpose.	1
	it entertained me and removed me temporarily from my reality.      	1
	50 pages too long.i have read all of dan brown's books except deception point, which i still have on the shelf.	1
	i thought his first book, the digital fortress, was among the worst books i have ever read.	1
	the da vinci was among the best i have ever read and angels and demons (except for the stupid ending) was only slightly less so.	1
	but the lost symbol regressed to a new low.	1
	discounting some of the flaws i found in the plot itself, the book is at least 50 pages too long.	1
	the interminable passages dealing with brain power research and alternative interpretations in the bible and other religeous books simply overpowered the overall plot to the point that i had to literally struggle to complete the book.	1
	i think this will be my last dan brown book and i am inclined to leave deception point on the shelf unread.      	1
	very contrived.far fetched, although not so much as angels and demons.	1
	don't get me wrong, i like fiction.	1
	but this was just trying too hard, and pass off some points as confirmed fact (mana from heaven?	1
	really?).	1
	a lot of the chapters seem to be written as if for a made-for-tv movie.	1
	1-2 pages long, and contributing little to any plot or character development.      	1
	i tried but i couldn't make it.there is a point in all of dan brown's books when i get so disgusted that i throw the book in the corner and go on to something else.	1
	it's usually where brown totally misunderstands science and includes a whopper of a goof (creating anti-matter from thin air as an energy source in a&d;), or when i hear that he really believes the conspiracy theory ideas in davinci.	1
	that's where i am now in lost symbol.	1
	someone has just claimed that thoughts have mass and when several people are thinking the same thoughts, the mass adds up.	1
	and i don't doubt that brown believes all this.	1
	in his earlier books, i managed to ignore things like this and go back and finish the books, but i don't think i'll make it through this one.	1
	thank goodness for kindle.	1
	i loved harry potter because even though i don't believe in wizards and dragons, j.k. rowling didn't say she did.	1
	if rowling had said the whole story was true, i would never have made it through the sorcerer's stone.	1
	--- three weeks later --- well, i finished it.	1
	the suspense pulls it along pretty well and you wonder how it could ever fulfill all it promises.	1
	well it doesn't.	1
	it totally cops out in the ending with a long religious lecture based, supposedly, on 'scientific' proof.	1
	still two stars.	1
	one for the exciting decoding of the pyramid and one for the page-turning suspense in parts of the book.	1
	but that's all i can give it.       	1
	going downhill.i discovered dan brown long before the da vinci code became the enormous hit that it became.	1
	i've read everything he's put out, & i think his best has been angels & demons.	1
	that said, the lost symbol is simply a weak story with a lame ending that a novice can see coming from a mile away.	1
	in many ways, i feel dan brown is a victim of his own success...the da vinci code hits huge & there become a bunch of copy cats, to include the national treasure film.	1
	my biggest problem with this book came when i realized it felt like i was watching , which involves murder, a secret society, & the grid the city was built on.	1
	even one of the lines in the book and bones are exactly the same, which took me out of the book entirely.	1
	even though this is not dan brown's sophomore book, it feels like it is.	1
	this is a difficult genre to reinvent every time he writes, so i imagine the stories will continue to go downhill.	1
	i would advise to skip this book.	1
	if you need a dan brown fix, read  .	1
	in my opinion, this is the only book that actually has a surprise & thrilling ending.      	1
	it keeps going and going and going........thanks to success of his last novel, dan brown has achieved the ability to do whatever he wants as a writer.	1
	the publisher will be happy just to have a novel with his name on it to sell books.	1
	i have to believe this because i can't think any editor wouldn't hand this 509 page novel back to the writer and say, cut the fat out...about 100-150 pages worth.	1
	brown isn't a very good writer to begin with and i don't see any improvement in this novel.	1
	the characters are wooden and are not too bright or at least don't do very intelligent things considering how smart brown makes them out to be.	1
	there was one big twist towards the end that caught me off guard but i honestly don't know if that's because the book disinterested me so much up to that point that i didn't see it coming or because brown was that good at getting one past me.	1
	the overall story was okay, how he got from point a to d i had a problem with and of course, the length of the novel.	1
	i don't mind that if a novel is over 500 pages long but at least make me think the 500 pages were needed to tell the story.	1
	i had about 30 pages left of the novel and i said out loud, end this novel already.	1
	to each their own but i won't be picking up the next langdon novel.	1
	i'll wait for the movie.       	1
	good foundation, shoddy construction.obviously dan brown will never be able to top   but i was not expecting him to.	1
	i wanted a good story with well researched history and symbology mixed in.	1
	well this book had this but they were not integrated well at all.	1
	i am willing to bet that someone was hired to come up with the plot while dan brown plugged in the symbology.	1
	the history about dc and the freemasons is interesting, but the story is truly bad.	1
	of course there is always some suspension of disbelief, but on several occasions i said out load 'oh come on,' because it was so ridiculous.	1
	also its written to be turned into a movie.	1
	the 3 page chapters reminded me of the commercial breaks on lost.	1
	this book was all about making money.	1
	its mildly entertaining and the history is mildly interesting, but beyond that there is not much there.      	1
	i really wanted to like it but....i devoured the davinci code in a couple of days--could not put it down.	1
	this one...it's been over two weeks and i still haven't finished it!	1
	just nothing really to take me forward...do i really think i will find out what the lost secrets of civilization will be in the end...of course not!	1
	so i already have limited interested in this  cross-washington treasure hunt.	1
	aside from the pace, i have two major grievances with the book: 1) the villain is a red dragon ripoff.	1
	2) the novel makes the female protagonist---katharine---look like a blithering idiot.	1
	she is a world expert and researcher on noetic science--and there are long scenes where langdon is explaining to her some arcane tidbit or other.	1
	now i know brown needs a vehicle for disseminating his symbolist tidbits---but to have katherine look wide eyed in every scene and say: 'what is that?'	1
	is just too much.	1
	if it weren't for the fascinating little pieces of history along the way, this one would have gone flying a long time ago!!	1
	!      	1
	very long, not the best ending.i listened to the audio book.	1
	it was long, long book.	1
	i liked the idea of the race against time.	1
	i liked the villain of the story.	1
	lots of good clues and links to clues moving forward.	1
	the problem was the ending.	1
	not enough at risk.	1
	even at the end it seemed to go on and on with opinions on science vs. religion kind of forgetting all about the villain.	1
	for a writer who produced very good other books, this one was a big let down.	1
	can't recommend reading it, and would not go see it if they made a movie out of it.	1
	i think i'd be snoozing in the theater.       	1
	read one you've read them all.the davinci code was a rewrite of angels and demons when a & d didn't originally sell.	1
	then when 'code' went blockbuster, they went back and tweaked a & d and re-released it.	1
	now, they've done the same thing with the aptly named 'lost symbol.'	1
	crazy bad guy with a bad complexion.	1
	code device that langdon hauls around in his backpack until he can figure out how to unlock it.	1
	hot chick he can't quite connect with.	1
	'surprise' bad guy.	1
	'mysterious pyramid' - aka the washington monument which if you didn't figure that out 10 pages in you're an idiot.	1
	secret societies chasing after each other and you don't know who the bad secret society is and who the good secret society is.	1
	maddening - and maddeningly inept -  cliffhangers to 'drag' the reader along.	1
	did i just describe the davinci code or lost symbol?	1
	that's the point...it's the same damn book tweaked to sell 5 million more copies of the same damn book.	1
	if you didn't have this book figured out by the time the mini-pyramid shows up, you deserve to lose the cash you dumped on this crapfest and on the cash you're no doubt going to dump on the movie, which is the real reason the book was written in the first place.	1
	ugh.       	1
	three stars because it held my interest enough to finish.as many of these reviews are lengthy, i'll be a bit more brief.	1
	the lost symbol takes place over a short period in washington d.c., features the main character from da vinci code and pertains primarily to the masons (symbology, beliefs, etc.)	1
	the book is not well written.	1
	it reads a bit like an early draft, not in the sense of having typos or grammatical mistakes, but rather in the weaving of historical, background information with plot movement.	1
	a typical chapter, even late in the book when the action is heating up, might start with a dry paragraph that looks like an excerpt from an encyclopedia and then cut to an escape scene.	1
	e.g.	1
	(paraphrasing) 'the [blank] temple is a 100 foot high classical greek structure modeled after the parthenon and was built in 1842.  robert frantically dashed across the lawn dodging the search lights.'	1
	the shifts between background facts and plot are that stark and unpolished.	1
	in the middle of what would be dramatic or intense moments, a character will often mentally drift into a neutral and lengthy recollection of his or her study of a particular aspect of masonic lore.	1
	it's like brown wanted to write a nonfiction book, but wasn't allowed to by his publishers so he hastily draped a story over the book he really wanted to write.	1
	i am quick to toss a book that doesn't hold my interest and i was generally entertained by this book.	1
	brown literally crammed it with provocative facts.	1
	but at the same time, i was constantly pulled out of suspension of disbelief to remark to myself how clumsily fact and fiction were woven.        	1
	the first 30 pages were exciting, then it died....enough was said in the reviews before this one.	1
	the ratings make a strong point for the letdown dan brown's fans are feeling.i think the masons and the noetic science society tricked dan into giving them a good write-up, then chasing everyone all over washington to create a tourist attraction of a very boring city - which even americans won't visit, just to find that we all should read our bibles/religious scriptures more carefully with 5 guiding words to find yet another secret meaning.i guess i wanted something 'fantastical and fancifully' instead had to sit through a sermon. 	1
	lost author.i've liked 'deception point', and 'angels and daemons'.	1
	they are packed with action, twists and grandiose action.	1
	i've been more tedious with the 'da vinci code', a pale mapping of 'holy grail, holly blood' to a kind of action thriller (i still do not understand how this book had been so successful, while 'angels and daemons' is quite better..).	1
	now let's go to the 'lost symbol'.	1
	the truth is that i had some difficulty to finish reading this book ,so much i've found it boring.	1
	nothing to thrill about, all revelations guessed by any reader hundred pages before, no real grandiose action, and an end based on metaphysical gibberish about man being unknowingly god.	1
	i've lost 24 euros by pre-ordering this book from the us to france several months ago!	1
	disappointing, to say the least...      	1
	repetitive, preachy, and disappointing.i'm a fan of dan brown, and have read all of his books.	1
	i enjoyed the fast paced stories with very interesting twists, as well as a little history.	1
	however, this book is missing many of the aspects that made his other novels enjoyable.	1
	he repetitively made the characters look at something with 'shock' and then cut to another scene.	1
	the 'twists' felt very forced, oddly timed, and not all that awe inspiring when explained.	1
	in addition, the end became nothing but pages and pages of philosophical preaching about scripture, god, and man's interpretation, when all you really wanted was for it to end already.	1
	sorry dan, but this one will make me very weary about buying one of the future novels.	1
	just didn't recapture the same exciting feel and flow that was melded so well togegther in his previous novels.	1
	overall.. a huge disappointment for me... even coming into this as a fan.        	1
	badly written page-turner.i didn't hate the book.	1
	it kept me sane during an intercontinental flight.	1
	but the writing is just bad, in a way that i don't remember in the davinci code.	1
	the lost symbol is a fun plot inadequately supported by shallow characters and silly, frustrating dialogue.	1
	the wonderful sense of being lost in a book never happens.	1
	the plot keeps you turning the pages, but it's like eating candy for dinner.	1
	not satisfying.	1
	i won't spoil the plot, but i have to say that the last chapter was just weird, containing a long, lecturing dialogue about religion that neither character would enjoy if they had seriously endured the events of the previous chapters.      	1
	painful to read ....i had high hopes for mr brown, after reading his da vinci code, angels and demons, digital fortress and deception point, and i must say i am utterly disappointed with this book.	1
	it's hard to believe that this book took him 6 years.	1
	first, it was painfully slow, and 2 thirds of the book is repetitive (dialogues, plots and scenes) and the ending?	1
	duh?!	1
	it makes me wonder if mr brown is banking on the success of dvc and a&d.	1
	;  page after page on mal'akh's physical descriptions, secret tunnels and staircases, the vow of secrecy, biblical quotes, the symbols.	1
	the writing is horrible, langdon has evolved into an idiot, always insisted that he was right about the symbols, and proceed to be shocked when he discovered that he is not (again and again).	1
	the big mystery?	1
	behold the bible!	1
	how original!	1
	*roll eyes* oh please!	1
	'the lost symbol', yes i am totally lost.	1
	i can't wait to get my hands on this book when it's released, now i can't wait to finish it.	1
	should have read the reviews before i bought it, and i wasted good money on a hardcover book that is 'lost'.	1
	'the lost symbol', indeed.ok,i'm off to read other good book...      	1
	huge letdown..when i found out this book was coming out, all i could think of was how poorly 'angels and demons' ended, and how much i liked 'the davinci code.'	1
	so i bought into the hype and figured, 'hey, i've got a 50/50 chance of getting a good story.'	1
	boy, was i wrong.	1
	having finished the book, i have to say that dan brown has outdone himself in the bad ending department.	1
	this book was a huge letdown!	1
	i seriously think i could write a better book (given six years), and i am not a writer!	1
	i agree with the one poster on this comment board;  do yourself a favor, and just stop reading the book at about page 450, because the rest of the book is almost like watching one of those firework 'snakes' (you light it and expect a roman candle-like display with all the accompanying oooohs and aaaaahs; but all it ends up doing is smoking for a while, then petering out and turning to ash; just like this book).	1
	the book was just a huge waste of 10 hours of my life that i'll never get back...  if you still decide to read this 'novel', at least wait until it makes it to the 'bargain books' section of borders.      	1
	brown has become a formula writer.i was very disappointed in dan brown's latest book.	1
	i felt he had fallen into the trap of becoming a 'formula writer.'	1
	the characters were just recreations of those in 'the divinci code.'	1
	he spent the first half of the book wandering around in a maze and the second half chronicling an obvious madman.	1
	even his 'the god within' secret was anticlimactic and disappointingly unoriginal.      	1
	i couldn't finish it.what a disappointment.	1
	i had read all of dan brown's other novels, and looked forward to this one, despite the hype.	1
	now i know why the hype was necessary.	1
	this book was unnecessarily long, boring, repetitive, and astonishingly predictable.	1
	and just when you thought you had slogged through the last annoyingly detailed scenario, mr. brown thought another few pages of ennui and anticlimax were in order.	1
	i read it on my kindlie, and with 97% of the book under my belt, i gave up.      	1
	prolixious pompousness.i have been intrigued by dan brown's previous works but this one left me flat.	1
	it is a compendium of old new age beliefs and a rehashing of perhaps america's oldest conspiracy theory groups: the masons.	1
	the professional reviews cited earlier reveal that most professional critics have not read much more than the title page, back cover, and opening chapter paragraphs.	1
	the formula for plot and character is now trite: take the lead man (robert langdon), get the uber-smart woman (katherine), the mysterious friend (peter), and a psychopathic enemy (the vengeful deluded son of peter) and plop them all down pat in a new but all to familiar setting.	1
	mr. brown is much to young in the book world to set a p. d. james pattern of sameness earned by long years of mystery writing.	1
	the convoluted information may be new to many readers concerning the pseudo-science of noetics and paranormal research.	1
	the pear project was shut down some time ago due to a lack of any verifiablle scientific findings and being a waste of valuable research dollars.	1
	noetics takes a non-natural subject matter and subjects it to the verifiable testing tenants of naturalistic materialistic science and asks us to suspend our belief in the verifiable world to adopt a pseudo-belief in those things that cannot and will most likely never be proved or serve any value.	1
	reader beware: mr. brown makes the human the edifice of evolution's accidental artifice and rehashes the now discreited maxim that ancient human thinkers were capable of far more than their world context and understanding allowed.	1
	weighing the supposed 'soul' of the human, come on mr. brown!	1
	the best things to arise from this work are: (1) an increased u. s. capitol tour business; (2) the continued flowering of solipsistic, tragic, and non-skeptical belief in pseudo-science; and (3) the explanation of the derivation of 'sincere.'	1
	as to this book, it does not fit the term 'sincere' as there is much too much wax stuck in the cracks of this paltry underlying sculpture not yet fit for public viewing.	1
	it represents the author's only goal of taking the money to the bank through profiteering on cheap literary devices, conspiracy theories, pseudo-science, and barnum's 'there's one [a fool] born every minute' philosopy.	1
	well, i've been fooled enough by dan brown.	1
	this will be the last time i spend money to read such drivel and banality.        	1
	interesting topic poorly rendered.in general, this book was a major disappointment after reading the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	the story really just felt too formulaic.	1
	also, most of the characters seemed very two dimensional.	1
	the antagonist was depicted as a cartoonishly evil and almost omnipotent freak--not really believable.	1
	the highlights of the book were: a few of the many plot twists, the mostly fair, informative and generally accurate portrayal of freemasonry and a minor portion of the philosophical insights.	1
	though, i don't think i can every stand to see the word 'apotheosis' again.	1
	a mistake i made was to read this book after reading the beautifully and painstaking written name of the rose, by umberto eco.	1
	this book can simply not be compared to eco's work.	1
	umberto artfully immerses you into the complex world of the book while, in this book, brown seeming knocks you over the head and then drags you through it.	1
	this  the last 100 pages or so of the book were simply not well put together.	1
	i even found myself skimming some of the final chapters because of the redundancy.	1
	it seems like the product of someone who was working to a strict publisher deadline and just wanted to be complete.  	1
	the duh vinci code.so great were the media inspired expectations for this novel that anything dan brown produced without direct divine intervention could not have met them.	1
	nevertheless, his latest work disappoints at an unprecedented level.	1
	certainly, there is enough puerile symbology, pseudo reasoning, action and plot twists to keep the reader occupied, though some genuinely extraneous and tedious passages dramatically slow the pace.	1
	(perhaps the publisher based the price of the book on weight.)	1
	but readers offended by the indefinite conclusion of 'the da vinci code' will be even more incensed by the ending here.	1
	not wanting to reveal too much to those still motivated to read the book, i will say only that this symbol driven chase yields nothing beyond a tiresome and ridiculously unsatisfying dnouement.	1
	dan brown and his publishers have clearly discovered another important symbol - the sign of the almighty dollar.          	1
	drivel.i read and thoroughly enjoyed the davinci code.	1
	but i'm really sorry i paid $17 for this book.	1
	although the action is reasonably taut, the religious tautology grinds everything into a slow, painful skid into pure manure.	1
	save your money.      	1
	utter garbage.6 years of waiting for a new book and we get this???	1
	aside from the fact that this is a weak copy of dan brown's two previews books (skeptical professor - check, mysterious man - check, distressed female character - check), the quality of writing is that of a grade school student.	1
	while i don't mind the 'scientific' explanations dan brown puts in his books and i enjoy finding which facts are real and which invented, i can't stand constant ramblings of his characters, repeated over and over again.	1
	you can find interesting stories written by fan fiction writers and i am so glad i got the books at a library and didn't spend a penny on it.  	1
	i had to force myself to finish.first, let me say that i loved angels and demons, and the da vinci code.	1
	however, i was so disappointed in this book.	1
	it started off at a very slow rate.	1
	i mean really, how many times do you have to describe how crazy the antagonist is, i get it already!	1
	it did pick up about 25% of the way in, but slowed again at the ending.	1
	the ending was disappointing and the neuro science explanations i skimmed over, it seemed (to me) that all of that could have been shortened as well.	1
	grade = c      	1
	ending ruined the whole book.i've never written a book review on amazon.com, so for me to take the time to do so tells how badly i hated the ending.	1
	a good portion of the book was very entertaining, although tedious for all the reasons reviewers have mentioned.	1
	i was still enjoying it when i got within about 10 pages of the end.	1
	when i got there, however, if it hadn't been a library book i would have torn it to shreds and thrown it around the room, or maybe put the tattered pieces in my cats' litter box.	1
	the build up to this great revelation, so mind-blowing that the cia was involved to protect all the mere mortals from knowing it and changing the universe as we know it .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	well, all i can say is it was ludicrous and dishonest.	1
	does mr. brown, his publisher, his editor, etc., have so little respect for readers that they thought the ending was a pay-off to all that build up?	1
	they can't be that stupid.	1
	they should all donate the money they earned to a charity.       	1
	the lost symboredom.i rarely write reviews, but this book upset me so much i cant help it.	1
	it wasted my time, sucked away precious hours of my life.	1
	why?	1
	well lets talk about the implausability of the things in the book.	1
	1. cia involvement: first of all, cia has no jurisdiction in the united states under the central intelligence agency act of 1949. why are they in this book???	1
	shouldnt it be the fbi or secret service if there is a threat to politicians?	1
	1b.	1
	in any case, what are they even so worried about to chase langdon and the maniac all around d.c for?	1
	***spoiler***because he might reveal some politicians are masons?	1
	who cares?	1
	that the do some weird rituals which dont actually harm anyone?	1
	why is this in the book or a major part of the plot?	1
	2. book drags on painfully towards the end - you want to just skim ahead to the ending...3. the ending is the worst, anti-climactic ending i have ever read.	1
	i dont want to spoil it, but after reading to the end, you will hate dan brown for wasting your time and will want to ask him for your time and/or money back.	1
	i read all his books, but this one is by far the worst.	1
	stay away and save yourself some time read a better book or enjoy the outdoors.      	1
	vapid page turner.dan brown's latest novel is indeed fast paced and entertaining...if you can ignore the predictability, formulatic writing, and factual inaccuracies.	1
	i was disappointed that the 'secrets' were so obvious that i was able to figure out the identity and motives of the antagonist as well as the hiding place of the 'super-secret symbol' hundreds of pages before the big plot twists were revealed.	1
	furthermore, if dan brown wants to make gee-whiz statements about the similarities of the temple in jerusalem and the human brain, he should check out an anatomy textbook (or even wikipedia for crying out loud!)	1
	before he writes dopey statements like 'have you ever seen an acutal human brain?	1
	it's built in two parts-an outer part called the dura mater and an inner part called the pia mater...'  ummm...noooo.	1
	this describes the meninges, which cover the brain, not the brain itself.	1
	as someone who has studied anatomy (and has in fact seen many actual brains), this was a particularly cringe-worthy statement.	1
	there were plenty of other items in the book that forced me to suspend my disbelief.	1
	for example: a character, after being seriously maimed, seems to just shrug it off as just 'mortal flesh', and then proceeds to go on a walking tour of washington rather than going to a hospital.	1
	(does that remind anyone else of the knight in monty python's holy grail who insists 'it's only a flesh wound!'	1
	after getting his limbs hacked off?)	1
	finally, i just don't get why any of the 'secrets' needed to be so secret in the first place.	1
	the big catastrophic thing that was to happen if the big tattooed bad guy got his way didn't seem like much of a catastrophe to me, either.	1
	all in all, it is perhaps something to keep you entertained if you are stuck at an airport, or home sick with the swine flu (like i was..cough cough), but definitely forgettable.  	1
	cheese, cheese, and more cheese!.i agree with most of the negative reviews yet i still give this book 4 stars.	1
	why?	1
	because the lost symbol succeeds at what it is - a cheese filled, page turning, diversion meant to be devoured by folks traveling on planes, trains, etc.	1
	yeah, it's not great literature.	1
	dan brown is the william hung of storytellers, the frank stallone of...of...umm...putting words on paper.	1
	the lost symbol is very predictable.	1
	i'm sure he has a 'dan brown story template' on his pc.	1
	this book has all of dan brown's greatest hits.	1
	famous artist like da vinci?	1
	hey, there's albrecht durer.	1
	secret society like the templars?	1
	how about the freemasons!	1
	and what about the codes and symbols that must be solved within a certain period of time or else the world goes ka-boom?	1
	like you really had to ask!	1
	a big beef i have with this book is its anti-climactic climax.	1
	i won't give anything away but shall simply state that the book goes on way too long after the crisis has been [spoiler alert] averted.	1
	a positive for this book?	1
	it's a very fast read.	1
	heck, some of the chapters are barely a page in length.	1
	so, if you want something mindless and fast to read while you're stuck at an airport, or train station, or locked away in the basement of a crazed mason bent on destroying the world, then this book is for you.      	1
	disappointed.i was so looking forward to dan brown's new book, the lost symbol, that i pre-ordered on my kindle and got right to reading in the wee hours of the morning.	1
	from the beginning, the ancient mystery to be revealed and the tone of this weak thriller felt off and forced.	1
	the story lacks the energy and spice that was so present in the de vinci code.	1
	there are moments when lost symbol captivates and one's anticipation builds - but the pay-offs are repeatedly transparent and weak.	1
	there is reference to a cosmic religion vetted by science that will heal our great human divide (readers of joseph campbell, respected scholar, lecturer and writer of mythology and comparative religion will remember this topic).	1
	as desirable as that is, however, the examples of science and mystery given were not so much supernatural science and mystery as they were tabloid.	1
	reading lost symbol felt like new-age meets masons with monsters on the side.	1
	i was expecting so much more and was deeply disappointed. 	1
	ok but nothing great.having read all of db's books, beginning with dcode and then progressing through his other works, i started off enthralled with the story-lines and characters and have been increasingly disappointed with each book i read next.	1
	as many others here have pointed out, brown's plotlines, characters, and key events are very predictable.	1
	and once you start realizing this as you progress through the book, other aspects of the book become rather predicatble and repetitive as well, such as the character dialogue.	1
	some of the events in this book are pretty extreme (out-there) and you would expect some intense reactions from the characters but some of the characters still seem to behave over-dramatically.	1
	one serious gripe i have with brown's writing is the dialogue he creates between characters.	1
	though it's not all bad, parts of these dialogues are seriously corny, unrealistic, predictable, odd, etc.	1
	seriously, everytime i read parts in his books involving student-teacher dialogue in the classroom or lecture hall, i cringe because it's so bad.	1
	he should check out a college class or two in progress and see how students really talk and behave in lectures, even those classes they are interested in.	1
	students don't talk this way.	1
	people don't talk this way!!	1
	also, brown has got to try out something different from the 'damsel in distress' routine.	1
	the lady is always with langdon, she's always lost a close male friend or relative, she's always single...  hey i'm all for langdon getting some during a story but can't it just be with a random girl who plays a much smaller role in the plot?      	1
	predictable.it was as others have said: bland in comparison to his other works.	1
	there were in face entirely too many chapters that we didn't even need to have.	1
	mostly it was predictable, i solved the riddle a few chapters in and was fairly certain that i knew the identity of the villain right away too.	1
	i'm glad that i only paid kindle price for it.      	1
	skip the beginning & the end, it can be a great read!.speaking as someone who loved the davinci code as well as angels & demons, i approached the lost symbol with a lot of excitement and was ready to read it in one sitting (like i had the other two).	1
	unfortunately, dan brown's latest literary attempt got off to a slow start.	1
	in many places reminding me of the nicolas cage movie, 'national treasure'.	1
	eventually things began to pick up and during the middle third of the book i had trouble reading fast enough!	1
	then i reached the last 15 chapters or so, and i became extremely disappointed.	1
	not only do i feel like i was cheated out of a great 'brown-worthy' ending, but i felt as if he didn't even know where he wanted the end of the story to go so he just kind of let it dangle.	1
	where this novel started off reminding me of a movie, the end left me feeling like i'd just finished reading 'the secret' and that is not a compliment.	1
	if you're looking for a great thriller with twists and turns, you may be better served choosing something else. 	1
	what a disappointment!.my wife and i eagerly bought the audiobook of the lost symbol on the day it came out, having so thoroughly enjoyed dan brown's other four books.	1
	we stuck with it for as long as we could, but about 50 tracks into the book (out of 134) we just gave up.	1
	the technology and fads in this book are sort of like 'the best of 2003' that you'd hear on the golden oldies channel.	1
	noetics?	1
	an individually coded search spider?	1
	which can find the key document that an accomplished hacker can't?	1
	please.	1
	it's as if the author had started writing the book, put it down, lost interest, and came back to it years later.	1
	then, when an editor tried to bring individual elements up to date, those elements, while technically accurate, can not possibly be brought into the context of today's world.	1
	spoiler alert:  the early part of the book is so full of howlers, it's laughable.	1
	after one day, you willingly let the bad guy into the inner sanctum?	1
	with no vetting?	1
	then, 'just run him over with the volvo, katherine!'	1
	(this is where we gave up - it was just too much to bear.)	1
	net, unless you are 100% right brained, with a complete and utter ability to suspend judgment and simply let the unreality wash over you, avoid this book.	1
	it will break your heart, the same way the lame film adaptions of the davinci code and angels and demons did before its release.      	1
	ugh!	1
	did i really waste my time with this book?.this book gets 2 stars instead of just 1 because it did keep me entertained for the first half.	1
	however, about 70% of the way through the book, it began to all fall apart.	1
	seriously, weighing the soul?	1
	that has been attempted many times.	1
	since when does one patient having decrease in weight at death = weighing the soul.	1
	ick!	1
	that is just the tip of the iceberg.	1
	the ending seemed like he had gotten bored with his story line, or perhaps his deadline was coming due, and he rushed it as quickly as possible.	1
	i only finished the book because i hoped he would redeem himself at the end.	1
	he didn't.	1
	sometimes, it's best to stop when you're hot.	1
	this is an instance of not stopping when you should.        	1
	laughing all the way to the bank.when an author is a billonaire there is no excuse for factual error.	1
	never mind the atrocious writing.	1
	try counting how many times this literary genius can find no other word than 'countless' to use.	1
	they, like everything to which he applies this term, are actually 'countable'.pythagoros did not invent the saying 'know yourself'.	1
	this saying has been attributed to at least six greek sages, and was probably a familiar one long before the birth of pythagoros.the cia is specifically prohibited by law from operating inside the usa.	1
	it certainly has no powers to arrest american citizens.	1
	the idea that exposing the fraternity-brother antics of the idiotic masons could be a threat to national security is ludicrous.this is what happens when someone of sophomoric intellect plays with ideas as if they were play dough.      	1
	a whole lot of fluff.the world's biggest build-up to a 'no-ending at all' book that i have ever read.	1
	i think the real 'eternal, all powerful, all secret, etc.'	1
	message here is that dan brown is playing a little joke on his readers to see just how much bull they will pay for.	1
	a couple of points: halfway thru the book, brown draws on einstein for support.	1
	einstein would have vomited at being associated with this tripe.	1
	also, the tallest obelisk in the u.s. is the san jacinto monument on the houston ship channel - a little item not well known to eastern, elitist types.	1
	it beats the wash. monument by fifteen feet, although it does have a little help from a star on top and a museum at its base.      	1
	don't bother.this book was a waste of time.	1
	although the beginning is interesting, the book seems to fall apart in the middle and comes to a weak ending.	1
	angels & demons was a fascinating book and the da vinci code was an ok read.	1
	dan brown seems to be slipping!      	1
	awful.i was very disappointed with this book.	1
	i was so looking forward to it and had it pre-ordered and it was definitely not worth the wait.	1
	i love to read and usually read a book in 2-3 days if it's good.	1
	this book took me two weeks and i can't count the number of times i almost quit reading it.	1
	dan brown - if i want to be lectured to i'll take a college course and if i want to be preached to i'll go to church.	1
	you're book is a work of fiction and i expected to be entertained.	1
	i was not at all.	1
	i guess you met your goal with it though.	1
	you made a great deal of money from hanging onto the coattails of your previous books.	1
	but in my book you really let down your fans.      	1
	what utter trash.borrowed this book to waste time on a long journey, but what utter rubbish it turned out to be.	1
	a cluttered mish-mash of symbology that's supposed to be very mysterious, page after page of cliches and supposed eureka moments of deciphering 'great secrets' that start to numb your mind out of boredom after two pages, an incredibly thin plot line, a huge build up to a possible worldwide cataclysm, and a colossally anticlimactic ending.	1
	i really wanted to say something nice about this book and the author, but a 9,000-page thesis on pond-scum from around the world would have a stronger, more sensible and more interesting story line than this book.       	1
	praie the lord...secretly.	1
	i don't know what was more disappointing.	1
	the anticipation that i personally felt for this book and the incredible letdown about 2/3 of the way through, or the evangelicalizing of one mr. dan brown.	1
	now to be fair it's been a few years since i read the previous 2 langdon books, but i don't recall this much proselytizing or natutally assumed beliefs in either of them.	1
	for no reason at all brown has decided to bring noetic science to the fore-front as a legitimate scientific dicipline.	1
	to call this absured science-fiction would be to insult star trek geeks every where.	1
	for crying out loud, one character devices a machine that can weigh the human soul!!	1
	and my personal favorite moment of 'i really do believe in god'  is the first hand account we are given of one character being sucked into hell after he dies.	1
	please mr. hanks and mr. howard give this one a wide berth.	1
	do not taint your good names with this drek.	1
	and as for you mr. brown, this book  should not be listed in the thriller section of the book store.	1
	it should be on the dusty shelf in the back squeezed inbetween the remaining copies of the left behind series and listed under spiritual fiction.	1
	maybe the movie version could even feature kirk cameron, i hear he's looking for work.  	1
	national displeasure--mediocre at every level.well, here we are, six years since robert langdon finally supplanted harry potter as america's favorite fantasy hero.	1
	and now, after the 'national treasure' series aped the symbol-lore-thriller gimmick dan brown introduced to a generation of gullible readers, brown returns the favor with 'the lost symbol.'	1
	it's hard to begin to say how truly derivative this latest brown potboiler-with-pretension really is.	1
	let's start by recapping the dan brown formula, which permeates all his books: 1. a seemingly naive protagonist who is the best at what he/she does but finds himself/herself thrown into events beyond his/her control.2.	1
	a paternalistic figure--sometimes, literally, a father, but often an older mentor of some kind--who becomes the central go-to helper for the protagonist but often turns out to be a villain3.	1
	in the case of the langon books, a troubled female character with a genius intellect and major real or surrogate father issues4.	1
	powerful authority figures who try to thwart the protagonists' objectives, but, in spite of having the entire resources of a city/country at their fingertips, always seem to be fooled by the protanogists' simple deceptions5.	1
	peripheral characters, most often unattractive technology geeks, that provide technical support and little else to advance the narrative to the basic formula, add the special cliches of the langdon novels: 1. a mysterious call from a langdon associate/admirer that drags him into a murder scene2.	1
	a set of symbols that begins an long and drawn out chase of other symbols3.	1
	long-winded exposition of religious/metaphorical/new age themes4.	1
	assistance from powerful mentors who guard the so-called 'secrets' that the chain of events threaten to reveal5.	1
	a psychotic young male character with superhuman strength and pretensions, usually motivated by religious fervor6.	1
	pursuit by inept authority figures who have a personal connection to the central theme7.	1
	the pairing of langdon with the father-figure-seeking, female lead with genius intellect and a history of family dysfunctionality8.	1
	some kind of central device in which are encoded the answers9.	1
	life threatening situations with deus ex machina interventions now, there's nothing necessarily wrong with repetitive potboilers that recycle the same plot elements.	1
	janet evanovich has played her same bag of tricks over and over and gets away with it because she understands that the stephanie plum novels are little more than comic books with words instead of pictures.	1
	brown, on the other hand, seems to believe that throwing in page after page of ancient history and lore, religious philosophy and ritualistic arcana somehow elevates his trash to something resembling literature.	1
	certainly his publishers buy into this with their 'illustrated' versions of his novels.	1
	one could forgive brown's pretensions if 'the lost symbol' wasn't so darned boring.	1
	the central theme--the mysteries of the freemasons--isn't compelling, unless you find the history of secret society rituals among the rich and powerful interesting.	1
	the central 'crazy killer' is little more than hannibel lecter with delusions of godhood.	1
	the seemingly villainous authority figures are so inept that one wonders why america has any national security at all.	1
	tne endless travel book-level expositional passages that introduce the narrative set pieces seem more designed for expedia that for a narrative.	1
	worst of all, brown's ideas are bankrupt.	1
	'the da vinci code' was compelling because it combined a balance of potboiler conventions with an interesting alternative history of christianity that was believable on the surface until brown's 'factual evidence' was proven to be based on fraudulent sources.	1
	in that book, the relevation of the alternative history could have changed christianity forever.	1
	in 'the lost symbol' the stakes of revelation are self-serving, rather than earth-shattering.	1
	and his clumsy attempts to legitimize the new-age snake oil sophistry of noetic 'science' by equating it with the freemason practices and philosophy are laughable and embarrassing--particularly when he devotes the last 20 pages of the book to a glorified undergraduate term paper on the subject.	1
	what's too bad is not that brown will make additional millions from this trash--hey, he's got to feed his family, too--but that 'the lost symbol' will ultimately greater publicity for and interest in noetics rather than freemasonry.	1
	after all, progressing in the latter requires a commitment to self-improvement through education and community service.	1
	the former is based on the same gullibility that drives belief in spoon-bending and esp.	1
	in a nation where more people believe in ufos than evolution, the writing on the wall needs no langdon for interpretation.         	1
	pseudointellectual pulp.let's face it: dan brown never was a great writer.	1
	his books have always been formulaic, the characters cookie-cutter, and the writing style is atrocious.	1
	this book, while moderately entertaining, does not match angels & demons or the da vinci code.	1
	had this been dan brown's first novel, he would not have become an international celebrity.	1
	i expect that many of his future novels will be billed as 'his best since the da vinci code' and not as 'his best since the lost symbol.'	1
	i will not comment on too much of the specifics of the book because i should not spoil the reading.	1
	nonetheless, the revelation at (or near) the end of the story is rather anticlimactic.	1
	the characters often do things and/or behave in ways that would be extremely unlikely under the conditions presented - their health and/or psychological condition would be simply prohibitive.	1
	the bad guy in the story (mal'akh) grew very tall under the influence of 'growth hormone' and 'steroids' after the age of 18. that is totally impossible because epiphyseal closure of the bones' growth plates eliminate the tissue on which growth hormone of any kind could act.	1
	i am not criticizing the elements of the book that were absolutely needed for the plot, but even the non-essentials are often misguided.	1
	we could go on and on with the 'insights' the book has to offer.	1
	it is, in the end, pulp - and if you read it as such, you will be entertained, unless your taste for more refined writing will intervene.      	1
	save your money .	1
	.	1
	......and buy something you know you'll enjoy.	1
	reading this book as about as exciting as reading a math book.	1
	impossibly cobbled together characters and thin relationships.	1
	dan brown even got the cia involved in doing and investigation (inside the usa which is against their mandaate as most people know) and shooting locks off of mysterious doors in the basement of the capitol building.	1
	(i was reminded of the guy in the divinci code who jumped out of a heliocopter with a sheet of canvas as a parachute) a completly improbable story line.	1
	when i get  minute i'm going to dump it off my k-2 and go back to someone like r. a. salvatore who i know is writing fantasy and from whom i can get a readable book with solidly developed characters.      	1
	tedious and full of errors..the cia is running wild all over dc (the capitol, the washington monument, te national cathedral, etc.	1
	and the fbi is nowhere in sight?	1
	the smithsonian's warehouse.	1
	housing 98% of its items has a total of two security guards!	1
	poor research and lazy writing.	1
	i guess brown figures he can just phone it in from now on.      	1
	even bollywood would have a better story line.its a struggle to read this book.	1
	and brown should have paid me to have finished it before throwing it away in utter digust.	1
	first of all, this book shows that brown is actually a terrible writer.	1
	he has no sense of subtlety.	1
	the amount of times superlatives have been used in this book for literally everything is astounding.	1
	the italics drive you nuts too.	1
	the constant references to ancient mysteries and opposing dark forces makes the whole experience like reading an elementary school fairy tale.	1
	then comes the atrocious plot.	1
	if the stupidity of events does not put you off, the gore will (severed hands [what was the need for that?	1
	], dripping blood, drowning in ethanol, screwdrivers through the throat).	1
	everything conveniently changes at the last second.	1
	everything is about to collapse, until suddenly a savior walks in and saves the day.	1
	how immature, or rather how convenient.	1
	brown should know that there is a difference between plot twists and a string of convenient happenstances.	1
	even 1990s bollywood was more believable.	1
	the characters are probably the worst.	1
	a villain that is impossibly lucky, and yet motivated by the most non-sensical objective.	1
	langdon comes across as an absolute baffoon, catching everything 30 minutes after the moment had passed.	1
	new characters enter with such frequency, you start reading about everyone with complete disinterest.	1
	even those who interest you in the beginning (like the vicious cia director) suddenly become hollow as you gain with the so-called plot.	1
	and then, if there was a need to hate this book more, the ending was the capstone atop the garbage heap that is this book.	1
	six minutes after the tragedy is over, people are chuckling and laughing and doing tourism as if nothing had happened, despite people missing a hand, having just gotten a second life, having almost bled to death etc.	1
	and yet i have a bad feeling that some crazy studio is thinking about an adapted screenplay, not least b/c its obvious that brown wrote the book with that ultimate intention.	1
	that movie would be like a cartoon.       	1
	apologetics?.i found this book to be waaay to long.	1
	there have been other reviewers who did a very good job of detailing which passages are superfluous, so i won't repeat the detail.	1
	my biggest issue, however, is with the author's attempt to make this a 'meaningful' novel, offering the way to enlightenment and 'at-one-ment' and a revelation.	1
	i have to wonder if the author felt that he had made so many literal-minded christians angry with the da vinci code that he tried to redeem himself by using this book to push the bible.	1
	or maybe he wanted to piss off more people by saying that the truth is in the bible, but most religions just don't see it.	1
	either way, i don't think he succeeded.	1
	the plot is too slow moving (even though it takes only 12 hours); the characters are weakly portrayed and the jumps from one point to another are fantastical without being completely entertaining.	1
	at the end i felt that i had been lectured by someone very pedantic and filled with some kind of religious fervor, but i did not fill inspired, touched or renewed.people will still buy this book even though it's terrible.	1
	i know i would have.	1
	but if you can wait for the inevitable dvd, you'll save some money and some time!       	1
	a giant helping of new age blatherskite.i wasn't expecting that much going in, maybe a few laughs.	1
	but i certainly wasn't expecting the lost symbol to be so incredibly and consistently bad.	1
	it's a flat-out snooze fest - except for the final 50 pages, which are like being harangued by a drunken madman on a crypto-evangelical soapbox.	1
	and excuse me, 'bringing sexy back'?	1
	what was janet maslin smoking?	1
	the main characters seem as neutered as the bad guy.	1
	intended as a paean to western occultism - which could have been an interesting subject in more capable hands - the book devolves into an extended advertisement for 'noetic science,' a.k.a.	1
	science-lite superstition for gullible submorons.	1
	if you need further proof of what brown got sucked into, trip over to [...] - this is 'what the bleep?!'	1
	and 'the secret' territory, folks.	1
	on the other hand, if you enjoy that sort of mysterious handwaving and magical thinking, the lost symbol is your motherlode.       	1
	better than da vinci!.in the lost symbol, dan brown uses the proven formula that brought him so much success in the da vinci code.	1
	robert langdon, harvard professor of symbology, once again sets his wits against a mysterious and murderous foe, solving puzzles of history, art and the occult, in the company of a beautiful female companion.	1
	they race against time to find a mysterious object and rescue a kidnapped friend.	1
	along the way we hear all about arcane subjects as diverse as freemasonry, symbology, noetics, and the architecture of washington dc.	1
	the pace of this novel is breathlessly fast, except for those moments when his characters turn into human textbooks, spouting background information.	1
	although i found some of them fascinating, the reader can easily skim these sections without sacrificing much understanding of the plot.	1
	if his previous novels are any guide, this information may not be too reliable anyway!	1
	mal'akh, langdon's evil foe is brilliant, formidable, and bizarre.	1
	he has all the frightening characteristics you could hope for in a villain.	1
	he makes a worthy opponent to langdon and katherine, in a true battle of wits.	1
	the subject of the lost symbol should not generate as much controversy as his last novel.	1
	brown is sympathetic to freemasonry, and he doesn't portray masons as evil conspirators against history or knowledge.	1
	he espouses a belief in the divine nature of the human mind, like an eckart tolle of fiction, only with an anti-christian grudge.	1
	i doubt that this novel will give rise to another cottage industry of books and films explaining where mr. brown fudged his facts, but the field of noetics might see a burst of interest.	1
	the final pages point to 'facts' that may strain the reader's credulity, but this is an entertainment, not a manifesto.	1
	although mr. brown has made some modest improvements in style, the text is still awkward in many places.	1
	i didn't read this book for the quality of his prose.	1
	i hopped on for the thrill of the ride.	1
	dan brown fans will be well satisfied with this novel, and they will doubtless climb aboard.	1
	once you are caught up in this story, you won't want to put it down.      	1
	brown is no rowling.the book gets progressively worse from start to finish.	1
	i kept on reading in hopes that it would redeem itself in the end, it doesn't.	1
	i skimmed the last few chapters, as they felt completely unnecessary after the so-called revelation.	1
	i feel this book is a rip off for fans of the davinci code and angels & demons.	1
	it seems as though the author was just trying to milk more money from his fans.	1
	this book was a big disappointment, and often annoying with the long explanations and thoughts of the stale characters.	1
	and i am tired of the author creating a so-called love story between the leading lady and langdon in his books, there is just no chemistry.	1
	it was a waste of money--do not buy it.      	1
	a forced and painful read.i lent the book to a friend before i read it.	1
	when it was returned she handed back with a look of stricken disappointment.	1
	i started to read, realizing about page 200 that this was going to be a miserable experience.	1
	i had to schedule time to read just to finish.	1
	if this one is made into a moving, the audience will walk out.      	1
	what a let down!.i know that others have said the same things, but the plot didn't make any sense once all was revealed.	1
	dan brown did a good job of writing a fast-moving thriller, but the payoff at the end didn't make any sense.	1
	additionally, the characters' motivations did not make much sense either.	1
	i am still not sure what the bad guy thought he was going to accomplish.	1
	overall the book held my attention, but i felt that the plot fell apart at the end like angels and demons.	1
	i think that brown has a few good ideas, but never really thinks them through.      	1
	dan brown managed to push the new low.this book is about: a bad guy who wants to achieve his goal by killing everyone, including himself.a good gal who researches a pseudoscience about how to reach the same goal.a good gay who has something the bad guys wants, and support the good gal's pseudoscience researching using tax payer's money.and a main character who knows nothing but likes to teach other people.	1
	and in the book dan brown keeps on saying that 'it is science.'	1
	no, it is not!      	1
	pedantic, repetitious & hard to finish.i enjoyed angels & demons and the davinci code.	1
	i had planned to read deception point, but now i'm not sure i want to invest the time.	1
	i at least need a break with a better writer.	1
	i would argue that if this had been brown's first novel, it would possibly not have led to a second and the critics' reviews would have been much less glowing.	1
	it feels like a first draft.	1
	if i had to assign it one word, that word would be tedious.	1
	the repetion was excruciating.	1
	the dialogue feels like it was generated by an eighth-grader.	1
	the plot is horribly predictable.	1
	the narrative feels like a thin veil over heavy-handed pedantry.	1
	(if you've read the celestine prophecy, you know what i mean.)	1
	rather than tell us a good story, it seems that brown is trying to tell us that he did a lot of research.	1
	my wife and i agree that the book comes off as one that somehow missed the editor's eyes.	1
	many contrived elements appear in the text, and the characters actually display wonder at the different unrealistic circumstances, as if brown is saying to the reader, 'i know, right?'	1
	when he is actually just being lazy.	1
	probably the most annoying thing about this book is the fact that the characters can't just say what they discover; they have to teach it.	1
	the protagonist(s) are trying to save the life of a friend/brother, and one would think that would boost their senses of urgency.	1
	instead, whenever some new development occurs, one of them becomes the teacher and the rest are idiots.	1
	i don't know how many times i read, 'i understand what you're saying,' said langdon, 'but i still don't see what that has to do with x.'	1
	to which the reply is something like, 'let me put it another way.	1
	suppose i were to tell you that y.'	1
	she couldn't just say, 'we need to go to the capital building--trust me!'	1
	that this occurs over and over and over again leads me to believe that brown has lost sight of the fact he is writing a novel.	1
	i imagine him grinning at his 'cleverness' while he writes, eager to show the world how much time he has spent a) visiting dc and b) using search engines.	1
	he seems aroused by the fact that people will google the elements in his book.	1
	i'm sorry, but that doesn't make one a good writer or suggest a book is worth reading.	1
	this book deserves the one star it receives from me because i did actually want to know what happened.	1
	i think there is a kernel of a good book inside this one.	1
	probably several pages shorter, and one that a good editor could have helped tease out.	1
	i truly think that people who enjoy this book are probably not avid readers, or perhaps more exactly, not readers who digest a wide range of books and genres.	1
	this potboiler does make the reader want to know what happens next, but the tension comes not from the plot; it comes from having to wade through scene after scene of substandard writing.	1
	i believe that anyone who has been bowled over by good writing at some point in his or her life would be spoiled to this book.	1
	there is certainly room for escapist fiction, but even among those books, there are good and bad.	1
	all reviews are subjective, of course, but i found this book the worst i've read in several years.      	1
	blah, blah, blah.i finished the book last night.	1
	i found myself skim reading the last fifty pages saying to myself blah, blah,blah.	1
	it seems dan brown has developed a formula for his novels and he sticks doggedly to it.	1
	i mean really, the last two novels brought langdon back from death, fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me.	1
	in lost symbol, mr. brown let his research and facts get in the way of the story.	1
	there was too much and it went way beyond the climax.he needs to get a better editor or one that's willing to point out the flaws in his novel.	1
	there were some real plausibility issues at the end of the book.	1
	here we have the solomons, one drained of most of her blood and the other with a severed hand, both of whom have just seen peter's son killed by shards of glass, and they decide to take langdon on a tour of the capitol building?	1
	come on!	1
	the novel had great potential, but it let me down.	1
	it would have been great with a hundred pages taken out and the writing fine tuned.	1
	please don't forget about the your readers, mr brown. 	1
	after dealing with jesus, how can you go bigger?.dan brown, in my humble opinion, is at a crossroad.	1
	his novels are built a certain way and we've come to expect it.	1
	his structure keeps repeating.	1
	the same kind of vilains, the same kind of twists, the same kind of historical facts, the same kind of thruth mixed with the lies, the same kind of blur between facts and fiction, the same kind of suspense, the same kind of hero (male or female)... except that in 'the last symbol', he ran out of juice.	1
	he squeezed everything he could possibly squeezed in terms of revelations.	1
	national secrets, extra-terrestrial life, vatican mysteries, descendants of christ... what could he possibly come up with after jesus?	1
	ancient mysteries?	1
	it was looking good.	1
	this so-called lost symbol.	1
	but at the end, you go: 'what?	1
	all this for that?'	1
	i kept expecting to see a giant golden pyramid hidden somewhere underneath the u.s. capitol with some kind of a 'stargate-like' portal to another dimension.	1
	and with the soul actually weighing something thus having the proof that there is a life after death, i was sure to see some kind of closure, some kind of grandiloquence and dramatic connection where the characters, robert langdon particularly, would literally 'taste' heaven and talk to god himself.	1
	instead... you have a cheap metaphore serving as a cheap moralistic conclusion.	1
	all this for that.	1
	that is what happens, i think, when an author runs out of inspiration but still feels like he as to surf on his reputation.	1
	like the director m.night shyamalan with his dramatic 360 degree twists at the end of his movies.	1
	the story exist only to make that dramatic conclusion work, thus putting the characters within a narrative prison that they can't get out of.	1
	therefore, it doesn't feel natural.	1
	it feels forced.	1
	the characters are doing things because the story wants them to do these things.	1
	that is why i think dan brown is at a crossroad.	1
	it worked so far but this time, readers are catching on.	1
	he has to find a way to re-invent himself.	1
	if not, what's next?	1
	we'll find that the landing on the moon was all fake?	1
	or that the moon itself is not real?	1
	again, after dealing with jesus, where else can you go?	1
	can't really go bigger than that, can you?	1
	maybe go smaller?   	1
	very disappointed.the lost symbol was such a let-down.	1
	the author combined so much scientific studies in the story, i felt he was trying to write a fiction/textbook.	1
	however, i was neither entertained nor enlightened.	1
	the story line doesn't really make sense to me, and i felt there was no closure (or i was in such a hurry to be done with the book that i somehow missed it?)	1
	robert langdon was such a mr. negative through out the book that he totally annoyed me.	1
	i do not recommend this book, especially for those who enjoyed the da vinci code as much as i did.      	1
	could not put it down!.i have read the da vinci code and angels and demons but this book is, by far, my very favorite.	1
	i have been an avid reader for more than 40 years and this is one of my top ten 'best read choices'.	1
	i could not wait for my daily work to be complete so i could continue this story.	1
	two separate times i was so utterly shocked by where the story line went that i had to put the book down ... but i quickly picked it up again to continue.	1
	i have recommended to all my friends and have researched some of the things he references in the book.	1
	great read!      	1
	the lost storyline.i normally do not critize an author, but the lost symbol by dan brown is just too much.	1
	i got the impression that he was expressing criticism of the intelligence of his readers.	1
	the book is long, redundant, exceedingly verbose and at times filled with pointless code breaking.	1
	there is the issue of eight franklin square.	1
	one would think that a prominent members of the cia's management would know that there is no such address simply by programming it into their gps in the black suv or by googling it.	1
	also anyone who has lived in d.c. for a long period of time gets to know that some building have numeric names that are not numerical in number.	1
	wow, but the cia didn't know?	1
	then the cia leader sends two principle people, langdon and katherine, off to a potential crime location with only one agent for protection.	1
	now let me see two principle suspects and one agent.	1
	is db's cia under a budget crunch?	1
	then you have professor langdon, sealed in a plexiglass box that is filling up with water, giving the secret to a 'madman' who had, let's see:  cut off the hand of langdon's dear friend; stabbed a screw driver into the neck of a cia agent (i did wonder where the madman got the screw driver from).	1
	also the madman killed a security guard, tied up kathrine, the female that langdon was travelling with, and oh yes and hit langdon in the head with something that knocked him to the floor.	1
	with all that death and distruction around langdon, don't you think that a highly educated college professor would have come to a logical conclusion?	1
	'if i give this lunitic the answer he is going to kill me anyway.'	1
	also, the college professor may ask 'hey crazy man wearing only a loin cloth, who keeps lying to me; 'we have the hand, but where is the rest of my friend, that you promised that you would return if i broke the code?'	1
	also, there is one other thing that seemmed a little disturbing about this book:  where are the d.c. police?	1
	that patterson fellow seems to hold the d.c. police in high reguard.	1
	and here's a news flash for you goverment fans, the cia does not have a charter that allows it to operate openly in the u.s. without the fbi being involved.	1
	hey, there's another prominent d.c. agency that was never mentioned; the fbi, this was a kidnapping case.	1
	oh well the book is fiction.	1
	and like all dan brown books, he takes valid agency and turn it into a bundle of hogwash.	1
	i must admit that this book lost symbol is a 'page turner', there were pages that i skipped out of sear boredom.	1
	and like other reviewers, i was reminded of other dan brown books that seem to have a similar plot and the same characters.	1
	albino man or tattooman, all have the same increadible physical power, spider like reactions, expanded wisdom and knowledge, and of course they have all disfigured themselves because they are insane.	1
	if there is an abridged version of this book, i would highly recommend it.	1
	but the full over five hundred pages version is burdonsome reading and at times just irritating.	1
	thanks for you attention   	1
	borrow, don't buy.if you have never read the da vinci code, you will probably.....maybe....enjoy reading the lost symbol when nothing decent is on television.	1
	however, if you are expecting anything remotely close to the da vinci code, you will find yourself moaning and groaning regularly and walking away from this book til the...tah dah!	1
	end....which can't come soon enough.	1
	i probably wouldn't be so disappointed if i hadn't bought the darn book.	1
	now, i can only think of the new movies i could have rented instead.      	1
	just as engrossing as i expected....i have to admit it, i adore dan brown.	1
	the man takes historical facts, places and people and creates a story the likes of which keep my on the edge of my seat and up way past my bedtime.	1
	some disagree with the way he writes, but i think the important thing to keep in mind is that these are works of fiction, not fact.	1
	yes, he takes facts and distorts them, but in a fictional novel, one should expect some embellishments.	1
	i should probably also mention that brown tells you flat out at the beginning what is real.	1
	ah-hem.	1
	i will not get on my soapbox... this story, as i'm sure you know, is set in washington, d.c.  brown hooks you from the very beginning, and the mystery only gets more complicated the further you get.	1
	the more important question is, who can you trust?	1
	i found myself questioning the worthiness of some of langdon's acquaintances, and for the most part they are on the up and up.	1
	there are a few characters though, that will intrigue you and keep you guessing until the end.	1
	and there is one exceptionally creepy/scary/strange individual with a grudge, and he won't stop until he gets what he wants.	1
	notes on the cover:i'm mad about this cover.	1
	the cryptic symbols on the antiquated-looking vellum, the seal from peter solomon's ring, the picture of the capital against a blood-red night sky are all fantastic and obviously the designer paid attention to the content of this one (as they should with all books) and nailed it.	1
	building up a letdown.like brown's other best-selling novels, the lost symbol promises an intense labyrinth of mystery and revelation mixed with historical macabre; on this point it delivers, but where the novel is lacking is in the even distribution of the suspension of disbelief.	1
	the last quarter of the novel is devoted to brown making the storyline more believable while attempting to clarify any suspicions the reader may have about what they just read.	1
	there are glimpses of excitement throughout the beginning and middle of the novel that suggest we are all potential indigo children, but those hopes are dashed when brown never puts those devices into play, which suggests that he is trying to avoid conflict with opposing religious groups; i don't blame him; he received a lot of flak for his last two best-sellers.	1
	the novel possesses an excellent beginning in true dan brown fashion while the ending makes you want to reread the da vinci code to satisfy your lust for a quality mystery thriller.      	1
	ending was a major let down.i'll keep it short being there are so many reviews on this...the ending was a major let down.	1
	such a build up to this great mystery that we couldn't wait to find the answer to and that was it???	1
	book flows just like davinci code and angles and demons.	1
	time for a new formula...it has gotten old.	1
	also, too much 'fluff' in the story, unnecessary details that seemed to have no point to the story.	1
	i'm sure it will be made into a movie...i just hope they improve on it.	1
	i enjoyed the last templar a lot more than this book, and it has nowhere near the recognition as brown's books.      	1
	the lost symbol.i found this book enjoyable, interesting, and somehow not boring.	1
	so why the 2 stars?	1
	when i think about it, i realize that this book does not have very much plot.	1
	it can be summarized very easily, and not much is really going on.	1
	most of the novel is explaining history, science, symbols, etc or getting backstory on characters.	1
	i am also not a fan of inserting the villan's point of view when it serves no purpose.	1
	nothing is gained from having the bad guy chime in about how he ties his loincloth.	1
	we also have to read the same event different times from different viewpoints.	1
	the review on the front page is absolutely correct.	1
	something is explained, robert opposes it saying it is only a myth, something is shown to robert, and there is shock.	1
	then, which really irritates me, the book cuts to a small paragraph where a cia agent is looking at a phone or some other unimportant nonsense.	1
	i get that this is supposed to make is suspenseful, but it really just feels like a cut to commercial.	1
	another big no-no for me was the obvious twist towards the end.	1
	authors add these twists to shock us, make us go 'wow', or shake our heads.	1
	unfortunately, i saw this one coming the entire time, and i think i'm not alone in that sentiment.	1
	the lost symbol could have been a 3 star with a little editing and a little less from the villan.	1
	if we didn't get to read about the villan so much, maybe the twist would have been more of a surprise.	1
	i also think that robert was a bit unlikable in this installment.	1
	he is supposed to be open minded, yet he completely shuts down any line of thinking that is contrary to what he was taught.	1
	not only is it out of character, but it is irritating.	1
	every time a new idea is presented he says 'no, that's only a myth.'	1
	give it a chance langdon, people are in danger!      	1
	hope for creative writing 1.01 students.if this author can become a best seller by putting out this dribble, there is hope for all creative writing students.	1
	it really doesn't matter what my opinion is, because the book is the number one best seller.	1
	it just goes to show you that you shouldn't be influenced by the spot on the best seller list as you search for the next book to purchase.	1
	the author is a master at accumulating more trivia than you could ever hope to digest and creating a story line around as an accompaniment.	1
	the plot has more holes than swiss cheese and the book runs much too long.	1
	maybe the publisher pays by the pound.	1
	it's a shame though to cut down more trees as a result of mr. brown's prattling on.	1
	oh well, you've been warned.	1
	the rest is up to you.	1
	remember though, if you encourage him by buying the book, more innocent trees will be unnecessarily sacrificed..      	1
	not bad-not great, but not bad.first a comment to gavinstomp-does something have to be factual and a 'real science' to be in a work of fiction?	1
	yes, the institute of noetic sciences does exist.	1
	yes, they are doing on-going experiments.	1
	but there isn't a katherine solomon.	1
	nor is there a lab at the smithsonian dedicated to such experiments.	1
	you must have really hated the da vinci code because that to was a work of fiction based on a few real people from history!	1
	ok, now my review.	1
	this was a decent read.	1
	some parts were better than others, i did find myself wanting to read more in some parts and other parts of the book were a let down.	1
	it did seem like there were parts of the book that just dragged on.	1
	and some parts of the book were typical dan brown, the running here and there, getting to a location only to find out they needed to be somewhere else.	1
	but all in all, an enjoyable read.	1
	a bit of a diversion from every day life.      	1
	the lost interest.it's a good read but it's not what i would call a masterpiece.	1
	i expected more from brown after reading da vinci code.	1
	a good third of the book, if you don't pay close attention can lead to information indigestion.	1
	it felt like i was sitting in a lecture during the first 23 chapters or so.	1
	it touched on noetic science but i never really saw how it fits in the whole chase.	1
	the notion of noetic science virtually disappeared after malakh blew up solomon's lab.	1
	there's a number of anticlimactic scenes.       	1
	bit of a yawner, its hard to write suspense when your rehashing old story lines.on one hand, i have read every dan brown work of fiction.	1
	on the other, i have not really enjoyed any of them.	1
	in a lot of ways, i think that the lost symbol is a strong work.	1
	its enjoyable to see an author piecing together complex puzzles.	1
	but it ultimately fails in a resounding fashion due in a large part to the restraints placed upon the author to use robert langdon once again.	1
	the character is a known quantity, he brown cant very easily add to the limited character study, and is very very constrained in how he sets up this plot.	1
	angels and demons was a hard book to stomach for me.	1
	the plot got pretty loopy and was so far out there at times that i was groaning in pain.	1
	lost symbol never quite gets to that point, but it pushes the envelope as far as credibility goes.	1
	every aspect here kind of is over board silly.	1
	i did not really like that langdon knows everything.	1
	its a hard sell when your main character has every single snippet of knowledge at his finger tips due to his photographic memory.	1
	their is not a huge amount of struggle to uncover any of the mysteries along the way.	1
	shoot, their is too much goofiness going on here for any self respecting reader to truly love this work.	1
	the characters are very limited, the story is a re-hash of past works, the writing is fairly forced in several places, the editing is not very good... id skip this one if i were you...      	1
	worth a shot.i thought it was ok.  he packed a lot of info on noetic science and free masonry into it so i did learn quite a few things.	1
	i just find langdon obnoxious and arrogant sometimes.	1
	brown also makes him way too smart.	1
	he figures things out in seconds and its like, come on, he's not google.	1
	the drowning scene?	1
	no body drowning is going to focus on figuring out a puzzle.      	1
	good, but not great.good but not great.	1
	i just thought it got a little cheesy at parts.	1
	maybe i just have a hard time believing that there is a hidden agenda everywhere we look (or right in front of us).his writing style is definitely very inviting.	1
	i could not put this book down again.	1
	i'm looking forward to the movie (if only it weren't tom hanks as robert langdon) because that is how dan brown writes, like he's writing for a movie.i would also like to see deception point come to the silver screen.	1
	i think that could be done very well.      	1
	good read but familiar story..i did enjoy reading 'the lost symbol' but the driving story smacks much too closely to that found in 'the davinci code' and 'angels & demons' -- it's really feels like the same recipe but with different window dressing and different (but similar) puzzles.	1
	i did appreciate all the details that brown provides;  the man does do his research and turns up some fascinating nuggets.	1
	it's almost better to consider the book a tour guide of the bizarre secrets of washington d.c. and unusual tidbits of american history pasted together with a modicum of familiar story.	1
	i'd like to see brown's next novel keep the historical, factual nature of his three current langdon novels but look for a much fresher story in which to wrap it all in.	1
	bottom line:  i enjoyed the book and recommend it, but it comes with a distinct aroma of dj vu.      	1
	boring and predictable.normally i read a dan brown book in a 1  days, 2 days tops.	1
	they grab you from the first page and it is a rollercoaster ride to the end.	1
	i love the short chapters and while i can get annoyed with the jumping back and forth between characters and plot lines between chapters, it is only because i am so anxious to find out what will happen next.	1
	i have missed cooking meals for my family and going to bed at a decent hour.	1
	however that said it was not the case with this book.	1
	while the book started off in the usual exciting dan brown fashion, it quickly declined into a mishmash of a plot that was wholly disinteresting.	1
	not only was i able to go on with my life, i was totally disinterested in the lives of the characters, not to mention to took several days to read the book.	1
	robert langdon, the every irrespirable, always entertaining professor from harvard was a mess throughout this book.	1
	he was totally off his game; stumbling from one landmark to the next.	1
	it was sad and pathetic.	1
	the plot was interesting but the connection to the mason was forced at best.	1
	the entire story could have been done without the mason connection and the noetic science portion.	1
	worst of all was the ending.	1
	the last few chapters after dan brown dispensed with the 'bad guy' was beyond pointless.	1
	i know he was attempting to wrap everything up in a neat little bow, but this package arrived doa.	1
	while dan brown is not the greatest author in the world, he has written far superior novels than this; in particular, 'the da vinci code,' 'angels and demons' and 'digital fortress' to name a few.	1
	i hope he goes back to the technical or religious topics he excels at.	1
	ps - note to dan brown - get a new team of editors - this team left in too much minutiae.  	1
	the lost davinci demons.reading the lost symbol, you get the feeling that dan brown had a closet full of research that he really needed to clean out.	1
	unfortunately, you also get the feeling that he took all that research, taped the pages together by whatever handfuls he happened to grab and said 'show me the money!'	1
	the lost symbol is a stellar success on that count.	1
	brown has written the same book three times now.	1
	even fans admit that angels & demons, the davinci code and the lost symbol have the same basic characters, the same plot outline and the same twists.	1
	brown only picks up his plotting framework and moves it to a different philosophical location; the illuminati, the catholic church, the masons.	1
	but he's quickly running out of steam.	1
	in the lost symbol, the characters are shallow, the plot outline is jagged and the twists are limp.	1
	the characters' motivations are insipid (oedipal revenge and blackmail) and their relevance to the story is tenuous (what does noetics have to do with anything?)	1
	if he continues writing on this downward trajectory, his next novel will be about robert langdon trying to decipher the inscription on a carvel ice cream cake while pondering whether cookie puss represents the maiden, the matron or the crone.	1
	the story's biggest thrill comes when robert langdon dies at about the 2/3 mark.	1
	for a few short chapters i thought that brown had decided to take the franchise in a boldly new direction or at least forestall his publisher's howling for the next robert langdon novel; the carvel cake codex.	1
	but langdon is revived.	1
	browns biggest error is the extended denouement.	1
	after various characters harangue langdon about the masonic steps and power words he's been chasing being absolutely, 100% real, it's revealed that yes, the steps are real.	1
	the words; not so much, unless you really, really believe.	1
	if you were ever disappointed that your parents insisted that santa claus was real as you wondered why he wore daddy's boots and pinched mommy's butt, you'll know the letdown.	1
	this long-winded windup takes place after different players have had their hand amputated and most of their blood drained by a crazed, illustrated lunatic.	1
	it would not be the time i'd decide to do some early morning sightseeing in washington.	1
	the closest hospital might be the next logical choice.	1
	and after all the chasing, black suvs, helicopters, explosions and paid overtime, i'm sure the cia would want a serious debriefing with the major players too.	1
	no sightseeing for at least a week while you sign statements and fill out paperwork.	1
	let's not reward dan brown any further for this book.	1
	he's already wrung mega-millions out of a single somewhat-better-than-mediocre idea.	1
	with as many copies as are already floating around out there, it will soon find it's way into your local goodwill or thrift store.	1
	buy it there if you haven't already read it.	1
	let's all help robert langdon retire.       	1
	to be perfectly fair..as many others have pointed out, dan brown is not the most refined of writers.	1
	the 'robert langdon series' is remarkably formulaic.	1
	there are slight variations, but essentially each begsin with robert dreaming, waking... being contacted (or already having been contacted) by some entity.	1
	an old man is always in trouble, usually he dies.	1
	a woman related to the old man is always involved, and always ends up being a romantic interest to langdon.	1
	if langdon is being held by authorities, a deus ex machina usually comes to his rescue.	1
	while you may not always know exactly what's going to happen in terms of the story, you usually have a vague idea.	1
	however brown compensates for his lack of polish and finesse with mounds of cultural and historical references which should lead you to other more absorbing works.	1
	this addition to the langdon series is no disappointment for those who are willing to look past the formula and delve into the theories of lost arts and informations.	1
	especially in the davinci code and the lost symbol, much of the subject matter is unknown to the general public, making these rather interesting topics known to us that we might seek further knowledge of them.	1
	that precisely makes his works effective and worth reading.	1
	1) easy, light entertainment reading2) exposes you to the surface of significantly more heavy material that is the virtue of dan brown's writing.	1
	i highly recommend this book (as well as the davinci code) to anyone who is not so full of himself that he considers these novels below him.      	1
	skip this, waste of time.i have read every dan brown novel and hence was eager to read this novel.	1
	just finished it last night and it was a complete let down.	1
	it was unimaginative, the ending was extremely unsatisfying.	1
	dan has one formula that he applies.	1
	a code to a clue which has another code which upon deciphering will lead to another clue etc etc.	1
	thats fine with me but the problem with this novel is - you could literally ignore all the clues and codes as they have no relevance to the conclusion.	1
	another problem - the objective of the villain was obtuse and dan didnt really address that - which makes it a huge problem as 509 pages were dedicated to that objective.	1
	mr. brown: the problem with this kind of writing is, you are going to have readers like me question our decision to purchase your work the next time - but you did get my money this time.	1
	a complete let down and a total waste of time.      	1
	i have never felt inclined to review a book before.....but this book was terribad.	1
	i read all the way to the last chapter just to see if it would improve at all towards the end but it did not.	1
	i took a break from this book and had absolutely no desire to come back to it (i did, mostly just so i could tell people to avoid it with some credibility).	1
	beginning was bad, plot development was bad, character development was terrible and the end was terribad.save yourself from this book, thanks.	1
	the lost symbol should have remained lost.i've read all of the other dan brown books and knew what i was getting into.	1
	he writes action fluff with bland characters.	1
	the two previous books relating to religion were interesting because they make you set aside whatever assumptions you have about the catholic church and christianity and think.	1
	this book is a train wreck and yes, i can explain why.	1
	it's pretty obvious even in the beginning that mr. brown spent an enormous amount of time doing research on settings and masonic history and culture.	1
	the problem is that mr. brown didn't spend anywhere near as much time and effort on a workable story.	1
	he took all of his research and jammed into a wholly unbelievable, boring, and creepily stupid story.	1
	frankly, i couldn't even finish the book.	1
	i got to the last 20 pages and just said to myself, 'forget it.	1
	this is just dumb.	1
	i can't have my brain abused like this anymore.'	1
	so seriously...i know you may have liked the other books.	1
	so i recommend borrowing it from a friend or a library.	1
	i'm sure there will be piles of cheap copies at book fairs too.	1
	if you only spend a buck, hey, it's good for getting your outdoor fireplace started.	1
	it's not worth the time or effort to read it and it is certainly not worth paying for.	1
	david cornelsongeneva/il      	1
	not worth the time investment.i loved .	1
	read it in 2 days and even took a sick day to finish it up.	1
	i thought  was good as well, although i thought the ending was a little hard to believe.	1
	i've read his other books, but only would rate them as okay.	1
	i was looking forward to the lost symbol, but was worried about the book being a 'sophomore slump.'	1
	this happens sometimes when it takes a while for a author (or musician) to be found; they receive fame from a later work and then after all the hype, their next work is kind of so-so.	1
	oh boy did this book disappoint.	1
	it was such a waste of time that i really had second thoughts to righting a review and wasting more time.	1
	but, here i am trying to help someone avoid a huge mistake.	1
	i'm not sure if it was a redundancy in villains, over explanation of history, massive plot shifts or that the freemason history being a little vanilla.	1
	whatever it was, it can be avoided.	1
	do yourself a favor and find something else to read.	1
	with all the amazing options around, i'm sure your search will be short.      	1
	almost two books--and that's not good.	1
	'lost symbol' starts out strong.	1
	it is a quick paced thriller with intellectual stimulation all around.	1
	how could it not be with robert langdon at the center?	1
	unfortunately, toward the end of the book, it stops being quick paced and it stops being a thriller.	1
	about the time you learn the ludicrous reason the cia is involved (the cia involvement is not a spoiler--it happens early on), dan brown's latest falls into a mess of irrational plot twists and plodding dialogue.	1
	in fact, the plot itself ends many chapters before the epilogue and the book takes on a tedious pseudo-textbook quality (once again, not a good thing).	1
	with the novel alternating between a preachy sunday sermon and my worst college american history professor, it became a battle of wills between me and brown--could i actually hang on long enough to finish the book or would brown's pedantic prose lull me to sleep (in the middle of the afternoon).	1
	i won, if you can call actually finishing a book that had lost all interest to me.	1
	the beginning is good enough to warrant a 'not bad rating' with the stars but the end keeps it from being a truly good book.      	1
	cheap thrills and **vague spoiler alert**  lousy ending.i have read brown's deception point and i thought it was actually a better book than the lost symbol.	1
	here is the major problem i see with this work (i might have this same critique of deception point if i reread it): it is essentially a long drawn out plot of a single day or a series of days that has very little substance or depth.	1
	this entire book (and i mean the entire book) is drawn out by the lead characters going on tangents that really do very, very little to advance the plot or add anything worthwhile to it.	1
	the essence of the book could be written in a page or less, but brown drags you through pages and pages of essentially useless information (some parts of which i eventually ended up just skipping past because i was so annoyed after hundreds of pages of it).	1
	i found myself thinking, 'get to the point already!'	1
	i understand this is an action/thriller-style novel, but i want brown to leave me feeling more intellectually or even spiritually fulfilled rather than just entertained.	1
	most importantly, i felt that the ending was very weak, anticlimactic, and not the revelation that brown set me up to think it would be.	1
	i will say no more.	1
	so the book wasn't for me.	1
	that said, if your looking for something just to entertain you for a few days, pick up a copy.	1
	you may like the ending of the book and i can guarantee you that you will be entertained.       	1
	a lot of smoke and little substance.i have read all of dan brown's previous books and had high expectations for this one.	1
	he is one of those authors who, given a few facts and a bit of history, manages to weave quite a tale.	1
	he did an excellent job of this with the davinci code and angels & demons.	1
	in fact, i'd hazard to say that 'angels' is the rival (story-wise) of davinci.	1
	and may be a little better.	1
	but 'symbol' is another matter.	1
	again he does a great job of setting up the story.	1
	and through most of the book, it's a tough thing to put down.	1
	but, at the end, i felt that the conclusion wasn't the 'fulfillment' of the story that it should have been.	1
	it's a bit like seeing a movie with the 'alternate ending' that nobody liked.	1
	my reaction upon finishing 'symbol' was an almost literal 'so what?'.	1
	it was a very under-whelming conclusion to a great build-up of a story.	1
	actually the word 'symbol' in the title is a bit of a mis-application of that word.	1
	and i was disappointed to see that there was no historical substantiation for the supposed knife of abraham that so prominently was featured in the book.      	1
	was able to put the book down - permanently - at p 73.up until now i have been a fan of dan brown's.	1
	i usually read nonfiction and technical books, but every once in a while pick up a novel.	1
	it is rare for me to give up on a book i have started, but last night on p.73 i found that i could not tolerate another paragraph of 'lost symbol.'	1
	how many times do we have to read about how brilliant and famous the characters are?	1
	how these elite people know or learn about deep dark hidden secrets that the unwashed masses are seemingly incapable of understanding.	1
	how clever and classless and free the main characters are?	1
	(borrowed part of  that sentence from lennon).	1
	i think i will vomit if i ever hear the words metasystems or noetics again (apologies to anyone who shares this sentiment).       	1
	wait for the paperback....first and foremost, if you have read either of the other two books in dan brown's 'langdon series', there should be no surprises concerning what you are purchasing.	1
	'the lost symbol' is definitely not a bad book, but it is not one that you will keep on the bookshelf long after your first reading.	1
	after finishing the book the first time, i almost read it again...not because it was entertaining, but because i forgot it almost the moment i sat it down...it was a very mindless read.	1
	regarding the plot, it does not possess the same charm that made 'the da vinci code' so appealing.	1
	while a work of fiction, one of the most entertaining aspects of brown's previous novel was that unless extremely knowledgeable on early christian history, it was often easy to believe brown's conjecture.	1
	this is certainly not the case with 'the lost symbol'.	1
	it's almost as if brown got the idea from a bad nicolas cage movie and did all his research on wikipedia.	1
	furthermore, the dialogue does nothing to help the weak plot.	1
	it is unbelievable, at best, and often devolves into mindless monologues during extremely tense situations.	1
	all this being said...let me reiterate that it was not a bad book.	1
	i would, however, strongly suggest that you wait for it to be published in paperback or check it out from a public library, as it is definitely not a book that will be read mroe than once.	1
	in fact, i donated my copy to the local library book drive just a week after reading.        	1
	moron's tour of dc.what a time-waster of a book!	1
	like masons have big secrets--they believe in the universe!	1
	several times i was rooting for the bad buy, but once again the bad guy has to have some physical deformity by which you will know him.	1
	in this one, tattoos all over his body--in davinci code, it was an albino.	1
	the main character has a 'swimmer's body' which shows that he is good.	1
	not smart, but good.	1
	and if you make a drinking game, try drinking a shot for every time the word 'myth' appears in this book.	1
	i like the way none of the government employees in this book seems to have a clue.	1
	about anything, but they have keys to everywhere.	1
	i think that the cia official was also made into a red herring by making her tiny and japanese with a hoarse voice.	1
	because every dan brown admirer knows that you should 'judge a book by its cover.'	1
	also, these are curiously sexless books.	1
	there are women, but dan brown doesn't seem to know what to do with them.      	1
	formulatic follow-up to the da vinci code.many of the reviewers here are bashing this book and i cannot understand why.	1
	of course the da vinci code was going to be a hard act to follow.	1
	of course dan brown isnt hemingway or tolstoy.	1
	but we all knew that.	1
	so get over it and accept the book for what it is.	1
	to put it plainly: the lost symbol is a page-turner,nothing more, nothing less.	1
	this thrid entry into the robert langdon sees the titular symbiologist searching for a relic passed onto to by a mysterious freemason philanthropist friend.	1
	the dialogue is riddled with cliche's and the characters are 2-d at best but this is brown here.	1
	the following is what(in my opinion) made the book worthwhile.	1
	1)a positive message.2)page-turning excitement that only dan brown can deliver.3)an interesting topic-the freemasons.	1
	however, this is what prevented the book from getting a 5-star review from me.	1
	1)typical formulatic plot.	1
	landon stumbles across a conspiracy(imagine that boys and girls) and only he can prevent a disaster that will have reprecussions throughout the entire world.	1
	puh-leeezzzzzzz!!!	1
	analysis: brown needs to alter his strategy.	1
	yes it worked with da vinci code but here it tests the readers patience.	1
	why not try something new?	1
	why not have langon be the cause of the problem and only he can fix it.	1
	just an idea.	1
	2)no recuring characters.	1
	its langdon and some brainy lady side-kick that dissapears in the next book.	1
	analysis:have langdon have an assistant or some other person who returns in subsequent storylines.	1
	i guarantee that will add to some of the excitement.	1
	3)too much information overload in every book with useless trivia inserted into dialog and narrative.	1
	analysis: i know dan brown is a well-read man but he doesnt have to flaunt his advanced trivia skills on every page.	1
	is ok once in awhile to insert information here and there but you don't have to preach every little tid-bit of pertinent information to the reader.	1
	a better way to get your message accross would be to  drop some some basic information-if the reader wants he/she can seek out more information on the matter.	1
	as i read the book i felt as if noetic science was being force-fed down my throat.	1
	enough!!!	1
	well there you have it...my two cents.	1
	but overall it was worth the $16.00 i paid for it and i got what i expected to come away with...an exciting read.      	1
	a learning experience.i enjoyed 'the lost symbol' and am surprised by all the poor to mediocre reviews.	1
	i'm not sure what others expect from a dan brown / robert langdon book.	1
	at this point i consider it a series, not an original work.	1
	this is, in fact, what prevents me from giving it 5 stars.	1
	there is an interesting plot twist towards the end.	1
	like brown's other books, i learned a great deal about art, architecture, history and science by the time i was finished.	1
	not that i take everything brown writes as fact - he certainly takes some editorial license - but he interests me enough to look into things for myself.	1
	improbable.i'll willingly go anywhere dan brown wants to take me in his books.	1
	i have no issue with the way he takes a kernel of truth and weaves an interesting and explosive story.	1
	i don't really care whether jesus had children or the pope is part of some great conspiracy or the masons have secrets; i just like a good yarn.this story had the potential to be dynamite, but was only so-so.	1
	the sense of urgency that kept you turning the page in davinci code and angels and demons just wasn't there.	1
	i can't put my finger on why.	1
	even so, i was willing to play along.	1
	however, a  strange  and improbable plot twist at the very end had me sighing with disappointment and scratching my head.	1
	i won't spoil it for others.	1
	i can only say that this was not brown's finest book.      	1
	very good read!.this book wasn't as full of action as a few of his other books, but i thoroughly enjoyed it!	1
	it was full of amazing facts about the united states and it's history/buildings/symbols/etc... it was entertaining and interesting the whole book through and i loved the plot!	1
	dan brown knows how to keep you enthralled!       	1
	disappointing.i read reviews before buying this book, but i figured since i enjoyed the davinci code and angels & demons, i would give the lost symbol a try anyway.	1
	i definitely regret it.	1
	i think because i am listening to it, rather than reading it, the repetitiveness and long windedness of this book is almost too much to bear.	1
	i really enjoyed reading both the davinci code and angels & demons; i thought the plot lines were interesting and controversial.	1
	the lost symbol has barely kept me engaged.	1
	it is predictable and poorly written.	1
	the major 'plot twist' at the end was obvious pretty early on.	1
	overall, i am very disappointed in dan brown's latest work.	1
	i think he can do better.      	1
	and the secret word is.......tedious!	1
	if you're expecting another davinci code, you will be very disappointed.	1
	like the pulp writers of the last century, brown seems to be getting paid by the word,as this thing just slogs on and on and on with too much exposition and far toomuch repetition.	1
	by the end, you'll know a lot about nothing.	1
	also, brown's desire to do this unending cya about what great blokes the mason'sare sounds all the world like it was edited by nervous trial lawyers...      	1
	not like the others, but similar!.i have read most of dan brown's fiction.	1
	i patiently waited in a library queue of over 500 to read this book.	1
	after reading 10 chapters, i wondered if it was just me or others felt it wasn't as good as the others.	1
	at that point i checked the amazon reviews, something i rarely do until i finish a book.	1
	it wasn't just me.	1
	it truly is a 3, disappointing.	1
	poor writing, too much, and too pompous.	1
	for example, this line in chapter 2, 'the towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless italian antiques - a piranesi etching, a savonarola chair, a silver bugarini oil lamp.'	1
	the whole book has lots of extra words and big words.	1
	the majority of the time, i could guess what was going to happen to the main characters.	1
	there are lots of larger than life themes that get tangled up and are somewhat straighten out in the end but not all.	1
	i also had a dj vu  around this book and national treasure.	1
	at times, i imagined it nicholas cage running around dc solving these mysteries.	1
	i did finish the book, because of the fascinating tidbits of information and puzzles and to see how it would be tied together at the end.  	1
	almost a good read.	1
	****spolier**** i was enjoying this book until i got to the part where we are told that the huge, horrifying secret is a video of top goverment officials in a secret mason initiation.okay so it was not how we would want our leaders to spend their off time but really!!	1
	was it all that world shattering?!	1
	i only have about 50 pags left and i just put the book down and away.	1
	i have been reading these reviews and i did not realize that zachary was mal'kh.	1
	i quess i was just distracted by all the 'is he kidding with this awful plot?	1
	brown's villians are always so paper thin, always so mind numbingly sociopathic.	1
	i thought the wole idea of discovering we really have soul was going somewhere.	1
	when we thought robert was drowned that seeemed to be approaching that idea and it was intriquing but then in the next chapter the whole abyss thing was explained.	1
	this was dissapointing at the end but began as a good read.      	1
	read it for the symbology, not the characters or writing.i enjoyed this book, but solely for the symbology and noetic science.	1
	dan brown did a decent job with the plot and 'puzzle' that it hinges on, but that in and of itself would not have held my interest.	1
	certainly the characters and writing are passable at best (although to be fair, certainly no worse than many pop fiction writers out there.)	1
	so, the occult history and symbol-reading was really the only thing that made this book worth reading in my eyes, and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone not interested in that (just as i wouldn't recommend his other books to anyone not interested in alternative views of the catholic church.)	1
	of course, this can't be considered history.	1
	what mr. brown does well is comb alternative history and conspiracy theories for ideas, and spin them into a compelling web.	1
	in this case, he brings in some popular new age ideas and 2012 theories at the end as well.	1
	and i think there are some subtler themes that are of interest, in terms of america's relationship to religion (and visa versa).	1
	but all in all, as other reviewers have stated, it gets a bit didactic.      	1
	worst book i have ever read?.let's see, what qualities does this book have.	1
	boring prattle that goes on and on and about ridiculous trivialities?	1
	- checkextensive, lengthy offensive segments about torture and murder from the victim's perspective?	1
	- checkcompletely unbelievable plot with holes the size of small planets?	1
	- check frankly it's difficult for me to believe how stupid everyone in the book has to be to allow the plot to move forward.	1
	apparently everyone in this story is a complete moron to not see through the 'masterful disguise' and the 'evil genius' plans of the antagonist.	1
	i accept that suspension of disbelief is required for any dan brown novel, but this one is beyond the pale.	1
	to each their own of course, but i found this one to be terrible.      	1
	great book, but way too much preaching.i thought this was one of dan brown's best books to date.	1
	the storyline was great, and the suspense decent (although a tad bit too predictable, and of course the good guys win, the bad guys loses...).	1
	one thing that bothered me a lot about this book was how preachy it was.	1
	it starts off at the beginning saying how sourced and factual everything is, and then goes and tries to convert you to a certain way of thinking by blatantly misquoting so many sources.	1
	do i recommend it?	1
	yes.	1
	but be prepared to be 'evangelized' - don't know why, but more and more dan brown is attempting to do this with his books - i really wish he'd quit.      	1
	a little flat for dan brown.i waited extremely impatiently for this book to be released, and when it was, i devoured it.	1
	it is typical brown in that is is a super fast, enjoyable read.	1
	it is atypical in that it did not intellectually stimulate the way the da vinci code and angels and demons did.	1
	not only that, it actually seemed very repetitive and even a little (gasp) boring at times (for dan brown, that is).	1
	however, even with the predictable ending and the rather flat story line, it was still a fun read.	1
	just don't go thinking you are getting into the next angels and demons or anything... hoping that the next time i can give mr. brown a 5 star review!      	1
	i like being entertained.i know the critics beat dan brown up, he never claimed to be a brilliant writer, just one that does write entertainment and in this book i was entertained, and it is an easy read, which critics do not typically appreciate the value of.	1
	it has made me want to go to washington, which i never did before, so it did open up some dusty areas in my mind, he did some interesting research into the mason's which a few men in my family were, so i enjoyed it for what it was, an entertaining easy read.	1
	there were a few times i got a little lost, can not even remember where those places were, but i enjoyed it, kept the pages turning on my kindle and would try another book of his for an easy read.      	1
	meets expectations.the book definitely meets expectations.	1
	i haven't read a book so fast since the da vinci code.	1
	just like in the code, brown manages to make a book that is both informative and a page turner.both my wife and i are now looking forward to visiting washington, even more so than we wished to see the european landmarks after reading the code.if you liked the da vinci code, liked brown's writing style, and have an interest in spiritual origins of america and freemasonry, you will probably not be disappointed in this book.      	1
	easy to digest but not much of a departure from da vinci code.if there was a long lost formula for writing a formulaic work of fiction, then robert langdon would be the man to track it down and decipher its many interpretations to the point of exhaustion, all while being chased through corridors, caverns and cathedrals.	1
	dan brown is definitely using this formula in the lost symbol, his remarkably similar follow-up to the da vinci code.	1
	in this go round, the masonic order and washington dc are his subject and setting, as a mysterious tattooed man threatens to bring the secret society to its knees.	1
	after having gained surreptitious initiation into the order's 33rd degree, our villain kidnaps a close masonic friend of langdon's in his quest to learn the most hidden and revered secrets of the society.	1
	the book derails about a quarter the way through, round about the time that langdon starts 'remembering' the most inconceivably remote coincidences of masonic symbology.	1
	a reader can only suspend their disbelief for so long, and langdon's photographic memory does a bit too much heavy lifting here for such a slight frame.	1
	full credit must be given to brown for his thorough research, and for the inclusion of some interesting code breaking puzzelry and a plethora of military and cia minutia.	1
	he even opens the door to the unique world of noetic science, which no doubt will serve to enlighten a few readers with its bizarre claims and pursuits.	1
	but the sum of many interesting parts does not make for a very engaging read.	1
	at the end we are left with a plot twist that was a dead give away in the first few chapters, and a long drawn out conclusion that fizzles and pops with very little resolve.	1
	dan brown had a tough hill to climb after having reached such a pinnacle with his previous work; the subject of the lost symbol worked, he just could have told a much better story with the formula he seems so comfortable using on each expedition.       	1
	the lost symbol is a great read..wow.	1
	dan brown just keeps getting better.	1
	there were a couple of times i was absolutely shocked with what he had written.	1
	i couldn't imagine where he would go next, but he pulled it off brilliantly.	1
	what i especially liked about this book was the fact it was based in d.c. so when i visit there i can actually go see some of the artwork and statuary he was refereing to.	1
	although the da vinci code was great, i don't expect to ever get to those landmarks in france that he talked about.	1
	the background on the mason's was fascinating too.	1
	don't know how accurate his explanations are, but i'll bet the basics are pretty close, although i imagine the biggest secrets are not quite as he explained it.	1
	great read though.	1
	i sure enjoyed it.      	1
	would this book even have been published if an unknown author wrote it?.i was a huge dan brown fan, even before he was popular.	1
	alas, this is no longer true.	1
	'the lost symbol' is a poor piece of writing!	1
	many of these reviews, however, are very entertaining!	1
	i totally agree with those who are disappointed with brown's formulaic approach.	1
	it reminds me of a 'madlib,' where the players add words to blanks in a prewritten vignette.	1
	fill in the blanks for: a cult-like aspect of a mainstream religion or belief; an odd, deviant eunuch on a mission that threatens to reveal a closely guarded secret of the cult-like group; a revered and beloved, older man who is an expert in his field; a brilliant daughter-figure of the old man; a setting in a well-known major city with lots of history.	1
	every writing teacher admonishes students at every level to 'show, don't tell.'	1
	too bad brown has forgotten this lesson.	1
	during the frequent 'chase scenes,' brown tells us every turn the characters make, being sure to mention any d.c. landmark.	1
	is he trying to convince us he is really familiar with washington d.c., or is trying to make readers who know d.c. feel like insiders?	1
	often repeated phrases such as 'he looked on in shock' or 'suddenly it all made sense,' the inner narratives, and the lectures by katherine and peter tell, don't show the reader what to think.	1
	the last part of the book is so preachy that i was reminded of 'the shack.'	1
	even though brown's other best sellers dealt with religion, the resolution of each was dependent on langdon's bravery and brilliance.	1
	the resolution of 'the lost symbol' is just pages and pages of katherine and peter's pedantic preaching!	1
	it makes langdon look like an idiot.	1
	the book should have ended shortly after the helicopter scene (obviously written for the movie).	1
	and while i'm on the subject of the peter's preaching, it is totally unbelievable that an older man with a severed hand could carry on the way he did!!!	1
	my sense is that brown has followed his editor's instructions to capitalize on the success of his previous two best sellers by writing the same book again with different details.	1
	my hope is that brown will have the courage to write a more original book next time, or not write another book at all.	1
	i wonder if an unknown writer had submitted this book, if it would have even been considered for publication.      	1
	waited this long for this?.the national security threat is such a joke.	1
	the whole novel people such as the cia director and the architect can't believe what will happen if mal'akh succeeds in his plans and then you get to the end and, i don't know if i speak for everyone, but i was like 'really?'	1
	the couple twists in the plot were average at best.	1
	the very ending of the book didn't wrap anything up.	1
	the noetics science had no real coherency with the book.	1
	this book was too concentrated on every single mundane detail about everything that it took away from the story altogether.	1
	don't feed me details that give nothing to the story.	1
	i waited 5 years for this book to come out and i'm highly disappointed.	1
	the only thing that is worse then this book is when ron howard gets his hands on it and screws it up even more while making it into a movie.      	1
	the da vinci code's poor cousin.if you liked the da vinci code and thought that this book would provide the same kind of excitement, then you might be in for a let down.	1
	the problem with the lost symbol is that it is so similar with its predecessors (the da vinci code, angels and demons) that the plot becomes predictable.	1
	yet again robert langdon is called to the site of a murder/mystery, he again finds himself on the run with a female companion, they have to escape from the authorities as well as a medieval villain, the entire plot takes place in a single day and so on.	1
	the climax is very underwhelming - especially after all the hype that brown tries to create about 'the ancient mysteries' and the role of america's founding fathers.	1
	somehow the previous stories with their ancient european histories were much better than this one.        	1
	i give it 4 stars because it kept me entertained.i have to agree with some of the reviews here in that the lost symbol is not as good as the previous two books.	1
	i didn't expect anything greater, so i'm not horribly disappointed.	1
	the book is still a page turner.	1
	for me it was exciting because i do live in washington d.c. and do know many of the places he writes about.	1
	a lot of the reviewers here will negatively discuss his writing style, and say that it was predictable - yes the book is predictable, just like harry potter is predictable, why?	1
	because each author has a style so get over it.	1
	however, i will say that the book could have been better edited, and shorter.	1
	i also agree that the focus on noetic 'science' in the end proved useless in the context of the plot.	1
	still a good read though, and i recommend.       	1
	like carbon copies?.if you like 'em, this one's for you.	1
	it follows the formula of 'davinci code' so slavishly, it's hard to imagine an editor not clearing his throat and saying,'uh...dan?'	1
	same sado-masochistic weird villain, same follow-the-map-and-code action, same stupid man-and-woman-in-an-almost-romance scenario- it's just stunningly similar.	1
	i did like 'davinci code' (hated movie) because it was new, different.	1
	and i had heard this one was good.	1
	wow- major disappointment.      	1
	a decent page turner.i'm not sure why this book has been so poorly reviewed.	1
	it is not outstanding - it's formulaic and a bit long - but it's decent.	1
	any book that keeps me up late, reading more and more so i can see what happens next is worthy of three stars.	1
	it is entertaining even if it's not as good as the da vinci code.	1
	as long as one's expectations are not too high this book is enjoyable.	1
	it is worth a read for sure.	1
	the thing that really bothered me was that there were way way too many words in italics.        	1
	lost symbol.a fun book to read, yet a bit longer than it should be.	1
	the science is somewhat shakey, but one realizes that this is a novel, and the writer can take liberty with facts.	1
	since the hub of brown's book is the antagonist, after his demise it ahould not drag on as much as it does, it soon becomes anti-climatic.not knowing very much about the masons, and realizing that this is a book of fiction, a non-mason reader either gathers a great deal of knowledge, or is filled with a myth about what masonary is, does, and what it represents.	1
	if nothing else, unless one has knowledge of the subject, the book leaves the reader awed by the masons, and by the impressive membership of that organization.having once had a brother-in-law who was a mason, it is difficult for me to visualize how a person such as he, could subscribe to the rituals dan brown describes.	1
	since it is common knowledge that many masons occupy important places in society, brown leaves the reader wonder how such intelligent people can accept some of the strange behavior that he attributes to that organization.in spit of some of the detailed gore, the book is enjoyable; and if dan brown's description of the masons, their rituals, and their purpose, is accurate, one is left wondering what are the appropriate beliefs and behavioral guidelines of 'civilized' society.the main shortcoming of the book is its anti-climatic ending which spans some 10% of the total work, but that could have been accomplished in a very few pages...       	1
	davinci + angels = lost time, uh symbol.it's not that it's formula, but davinci code + angels and demons = the lost symbol without the priests, oh wait, there's one of those too.	1
	chapter 1,349'end it already,' screamed langdon as peter solomon continued into the tenth condescending chapter playing like a self-help book.	1
	'sorry, robert,' dan brown smiled, 'my new contract pays me by the word.	1
	''holy obelisk, dan,' langdon panted, 'even dickens wasn't this bad.'	1
	chapter 1,514breathlessly robert langdon, the trim, deep voiced, handsome, distance swimmer used all the symbols in his mind as he struggled with the weight of all the extra pages now pressing on his chest.	1
	as his eyes began to lose focus and his breath became more labored, a buzzing started to swirl with twinkling lights around the edges of his eyes.	1
	then suddenly, just before passing out he could clearly see the symbol.	1
	it made sense.	1
	it was before him the whole time.	1
	as his mind blacked he vividly saw the two green 's'-shapes bisected by a single vertical green line.	1
	surround the pair was a bright red circle with a single diagonal line running from the one o'clock to the seven o'clock position, 'that's what the symbol was saying, 'don't spend the money.'	1
	at one point in the book, it langdom seems destined for a permanent death, a hopeful symbol that maybe he will be killed off and there will not be a fourth book cashing in on the two previously well-written ones.	1
	brown spends a good third of the book defending masonry to the point that it seems like an out-of-court settlement from the way they were smattered in other books.	1
	'ok, instead of paying you guys, i'll write a book that extolls your virtues,' agreed brown.	1
	that or the masons are getting a donation each time their name is mentioned.	1
	this one is best read from a library check-out or if it's one of the freebies on your subscription.	1
	don't spend extra.	1
	it drags, it squirms, it squiggles, but it never gets to the point -- just like a 'make $1,000 an hour part time at home' infomercial.	1
	i think there was a point in it.	1
	wasn't there?	1
	if you liked 'davinci code' and 'angels and demons,' you've already read 'the lost symbol.'	1
	very disappointing.i really liked all his other novels, but this one was slow going.	1
	i hate chase scenes, and this novel was filled with them.	1
	i fear that a good hour of the movie will be nothing more than tedious chase scenes and unlikely last second escapes.	1
	the ending was unsatisfying too, but i won't spoil that.	1
	i did wonder at the end what all the fuss was over, not to mention all the blood spilled.	1
	the cardinal sins, however, were the 'logic gaps' -- where any number of highly improbable things happen that are essential to keeping the plot moving, without the establishment of a reasonable foundation for them.	1
	hitchcock did that all the time, but this is a different age.	1
	just one example: why does the cia lady just let all the mystical evidence stuff walk out the door with robert and kathleen, when she knows a dangerous madman is trying to get his hands on it?	1
	sorry folks -- it would never happen in real life.	1
	his other novels were logically consistent and had real pots of gold at the end of their rainbows.	1
	still i wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it, just temper your expectations.      	1
	why?.	1
	first there was 'angels and demons' (yes it came first in 2000), a novel by dan brown about robert langdon who is a professor of religious iconology and symbology at harvard university.	1
	langdon is called upon to stop a plot set in motion by the illuminati to blow up the vatican with something called antimatter that had been stolen from a high security research facility.	1
	starting in 2003, the world was bombarded with 'the da vinci code.'	1
	this time, robert langdon went in search of the holy grail and along the way managed to upset the knights templar, the priory of sion and the opus dei.	1
	somehow this book went on to sell over 80 million copies and contrary to popular belief it is not the #1 selling book of all time.	1
	in fact, 'harry potter and the order of the phoenix' outsold the 'the di vinci code' that year and agatha christie's 'and then there were none' outsold it by at least 20 million copies.	1
	websites and info pages have been updated to correct the statements that it was the #1 bestselling work of fiction of all time and is now being called 'one of the most popular books of all time.'	1
	next came two weak movies based on the books and made out of order.	1
	they got mixed reviews from fans and critics alike and both were denounced by the vatican.	1
	yet the movies still managed to rake in huge chunks of change.	1
	while the books and movies are entertaining, even 'angels and demons' costar stellan skarsgard had an issue with the writing stating, 'i think dan brown is a terribly bad writer, but he has cliffhangers at the end of every chapter which makes you want to continue reading,' and stated that the script was significantly different from the book.	1
	'angels and demons', the better of brown's work still underwent minor changes before future printings due to inaccuracies.	1
	now we have 'the lost symbol.'	1
	langdon is once again called upon to find something that is hidden in codes and buildings.	1
	set in washington d.c. and taking place over the course of 12 hours, langdon is trying to save his friend peter solomon because...are you ready?...peter is a 33rd degree freemason who has been kidnapped by a man covered in tattoos named mal'akh.	1
	mal'akh tells robert that peter knows the secret that would unlock the 'word' that is an ancient source of power.	1
	knowing that peter gave part of the secret to robert, mal'akh tells robert to unlock the ancient mysteries in exchange for peter's life.	1
	in the meantime, peter's sister katherine is working on a top secret project in a pod (yes a pod) deep in a government building but mal'akh is hell bent on destroying her too.	1
	in the end, all is revealed; kind of.	1
	there are chases and explosions.	1
	there are symbols and monuments.	1
	there are hidden rooms, secret passageways, dead bodies, giant squids (i'm not kidding) and more importantly, there is $29.95 plus tax wasted unless you are a fan of predictable and poorly written fiction.	1
	brown can weave an interesting story but fails in the actual execution of his ideas.	1
	i have yet to talk to a person who has read the book who didn't figure out brown's 'plot twist' before they were even half way finished with the book.	1
	there was no surprise, no real suspense and not much gusto to the story.	1
	it's starting to look like brown may be better suited writing children's books rather than adult novels.	1
	maybe his 1993 self titled pop music album makes up for these books, but i doubt it.	1
	brown's promotional website states that puzzles are present on the book jacket and you must decipher it in order to reveal the hidden message.	1
	maybe the hidden message in 'the lost symbol' will tell us why brown is planning 12 more novels featuring robert langdon?	1
	if so, i'll figure it out so i can be ready to be disappointed again.       	1
	does this guy get paid by the word?.i guess sometimes a writer only has one or two good books in him.	1
	sadly, this seems to be the case with dan brown.	1
	his protagonist is a narrow minded know it all who, after being proven wrong hundreds of times in three books, still believes he knows everything.	1
	i suspect mr. langdon is a reflection of mr. brown.	1
	none of his 'shocking' revelations were shocking; any avid readers of mysteries will figure it out in the first one hundred pages (which could have been nicely completed in fifty pages).	1
	but mostly i was annoyed by his incessant use of cliched phrases; i'm a pretty old guy, and my world has never spun out of control, i've never had a blinding flash of clarity, and, oh well, you get the idea.	1
	i confess i only scanned the last fifty or sixty pages, reading the first and last sentence on each page, and that was more than enough.	1
	it has been a wile since i was so disappointed by a book, or so glad to be done with it.      	1
	langdon started bugging me....warning: some spoilers ****** i thought this one was 'okay.'	1
	the robert langdon character, unfortunately, really started to bug me.	1
	i actually thought after the supposed *demise* that the author was planning to shift his series to a new character like katherine solomon.	1
	ha.	1
	fool me once...i was slightly disappointed, however, when said demise was a ruse.	1
	the symbol explanations were cool, as were the descriptions of dc locales (until i read the posts on how inaccurate they were...grrrr).	1
	overall, it was okay, makes me want to visit dc, but doubtful i'll read it again.       	1
	a big disappointment.how many years did we wait for this book.	1
	first, it is apparent that it was written with a movie in mind.	1
	second, it was a 'core' dump on everything that dan brown could research and then prove to us that he (or his staff) did all this research.	1
	too often it was unbelievable and way to often it was boring, i was afraid to skim for fear that maybe, just maybe, dan brown had something interesting to say.	1
	the beginning was a good read, the ending was tough.      	1
	average not exceptional.the book was not too bad during the first half but seemed to drag out a little at the end and get more 'mystical' than i expected.	1
	the thesis that each person has enormous untapped potential and 'man as god' was hammered pretty hard.      	1
	entertaining but disappointing.i love dan brown, i think he is a decent writer and his books are fun to read.	1
	the lost symbol is no exception, it was very entertaining through most of the book, but unfortunately i did not like the ending.	1
	i think the booked hyped up what they were trying to find way too much to only turn out what it was (sorry, don't want to spoil the ending).	1
	the book itself wasn't bad, at some points i couldn't put it down (which usually happens with all his books) but i think he already passed the apex of his writing after davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	basically, what i mean is that although his books are entertaining, they are not great writing.	1
	i'm not saying i will not read any of his future books, but i will definitely not except much of them.	1
	hopefully, he proves me wrong.	1
	we shall see.      	1
	the lost dan brown.it is not like me to write a book review of any sort, even if i tend to either dislike a book incredibly or want to reread one right after being finished.	1
	however, today i cannot do without saying a few words on dan brown's 'the lost symbol' since it was one of the most disappointing literal works i have ever come across.	1
	dan brown captivated me, as millions of others, with 'the da vinci code', 'angels & demons', 'deception point' and 'digital fortress' even though i found his writing skills are not to be compared to others of his category in that they are extremely basic.	1
	basic indeed, easy to read through, funny little word misplacements here and there, yet his ability to capture a reader's attention was absolutely out of this world.	1
	dan brown was, in my opinion, one of the few authors who actually studied his subjects to the point of placing you right in the midst of the story as if you were an outsider looking into the action as it was occurring.	1
	every time i turned a page, i felt as if i was discovering something new, even learning something new about the carefully formulated background information he was feeding us on the church, the masons, st. peter's cathedral, the government cover-ups, the landscapes, the cultures and the characters of his fictitious genial mind.	1
	in fact, i admired him for being able to create fiction out of reality and turning reality into fiction.	1
	this is what made him so admirable and why so many, like myself, were eager to get their hands on his next books, books that were always extremely difficult to put down and often too quickly finished.	1
	so, i am just wondering dan brown, what exactly happened with 'the lost symbol', which i think should be re-entitled 'the lost dan brown'.	1
	where was the research, the moment of instruction, why did your fiction not turn into reality and the reality into fiction, but, most importantly, why was this book so hard to pick up?	1
	could it be because it was contradicting, improbable, repetitious and highly beneath your capabilities?	1
	it was very hard to feel part of the book as an outsider looking into the very heart of the story.	1
	why does mal'ak tell a story in the beginning that entirely contradicts the story he presents to his father peter solomon towards the end of the story?	1
	how is it humanly possible for langdon to resurface and pursue the chase after going through that rebirthing drowning experience?	1
	how does rachel recover so quickly from having almost bled to death?...	1
	and again, what exactly is the lost symbol?	1
	is it the bible?	1
	if so, how does that become a matter of national security to be protected at all cost?	1
	also, i found agent sato to be quite similar to the white house representative in 'deception point'.	1
	as sato was a rough, cigarette smoking questionable individual who seemed to be in the wrong only to be discover a good person in the end.	1
	the only difference with this character is that she ended up living instead of dying blown up as the character in 'deception point' did.	1
	i think jack langdon should have died because there is no way i could ever even think twice about buying another sequel of the langdon legacy considering how bad this last masterpiece really was.	1
	can we get our money back?      	1
	disappointed.why is it that popular authors suddenly are so absorbed with themselves that they feel they can heap their personal philosophy on us in their sequels?	1
	ith hppens all the time.	1
	this book is astonishing annoying.	1
	i read all thee of dan brown's previous novels.	1
	the davincni code was fun (albiet preposterous) and held my attention.	1
	angels and demons was a little 'dark' for me.	1
	this one is gross.	1
	i bought it on the day it cam out, have been on a two week vacatin and still have not gotten to the end.	1
	his villan is simply over the top - disgusting rather than intriguing; his reflection on history, religion, the masons are typically boring and add nothing to the ultimate story.	1
	i am now at the pont of reading to get to the end - i admit, i want to see what happens but most importantly i want it to end so i can get to a good book.	1
	sorry dan, i don't think you hit it on this one.	1
	i evision tom hanks running around in it and i it just doesn't work for me.	1
	an annoying non-thriller.        	1
	better researcher than novelist.i feel pretty much the same way i felt after reading davinci code.	1
	what fascinating ideas he come up with; i really enjoyed studying the paintings he described for instance.	1
	unfortunately, the novel itself was sub-john grisham.	1
	2 dimenional characters, silly plot twists, etc.	1
	i would love to read a dan brown non-fiction book that would study further all the claims and conspiracies he mentions in his books.	1
	those are fascinating; his writing is sub-average.	1
	slice off the final 50 pages = great book + save trees.let me preface this by stating i don't read a lot of books.	1
	my main source of reading comes from magazines in the bathroom, calorie labels and street signs.	1
	however, i was sucked into the da vinci code hype and have read all of dan brown's books, enjoying each one.	1
	so, when i heard that he had another novel out, i had to jump on it (or make that 'sit on it' because when you're 5-foot-6, you need something to help you see over the steering wheel).	1
	the lost symbol is typical dan brown, a mystery that leads bobby langdon (i get to call him bobby because we're close) into washington, d.c.  when i'm reading about all the secrets of the nation's capital it's very eye-opening and i was thinking to myself that brown is making this stuff up.	1
	he's a terrific writer and you won't be disappointed but after the climax the book just goes on and on.	1
	trim the final 50 pages or so of this book and it would be a 4-5 star book.	1
	not the best i have ever read but still a solid effort by the man who loves turtlenecks.      	1
	disappointing, unfortunately.maybe to be begin with, i must tell you that this is not a novel but a script for a planned blockbuster.	1
	maybe if one takes it as a script, disappointment would be lesser.	1
	after the da vinci code, this is a very frustrating one for the fans like me.	1
	some quick notes:1. character formations in the novel are extremely weak, shallow.	1
	robert langdon is a reactionary guy.	1
	he first reacts to whatever told him, then he is surprised and accepts.	1
	same pattern throughout the novel.2.	1
	after , mr. brown might have decided not to touch culturally and religiously sensitive issues.	1
	this book will not bring much reaction from the church etc.3.	1
	the novel looks likes a 'sponsored post' (!).	1
	as if funded by freemasonry establishment.	1
	i have no problem with freemasonry, just that the novel should have gone beyond mere propaganda.4.	1
	well, despite all, if the narrative brought about exciting revelations like it did in the previous novel, it would still be satisfactory for me.	1
	but i wasn't particularly excited with turning points in the novel...      	1
	the story is a little lost.it took me several weeks to finish this book.	1
	i'd start, stop, start again.	1
	after i reread the first 80 pages or so several times, the book really picked up.	1
	there are over 1500 reviews posted, so i won't go over covered ground.	1
	i would like to state that the anticipation for this book was so great that brown would have had a hard time producing a book that pleased everyone.	1
	it is much like the davinci code in its writing, layout, dialogue etc.	1
	but whether you like the book or not, i think it is a fascinating look at washington dc.	1
	the references scattered throughout the story made me want to revisit our capitol and start looking for the symbols.	1
	it seems from talking to others who have read the book you are either going to really like it or really dislike it.	1
	hopefully, brown will mix up his formula writing a bit for his next book.	1
	i think this one was perhaps too close to the davinci code in its writing and plot execution which disappointed readers.	1
	i'm glad i stuck with it as i did end up really liking the book.      	1
	good, but the same old dan brown story.i really enjoyed the book, and all the little-known historical information about buildings, people, etc.	1
	but honestly, it's same old story.	1
	take the davinci code, change the setting to washington, change a few names, and you've pretty much got the story.	1
	read it, it's interesting, but don't expect huge things from it.      	1
	i just thought i'd buy into the hype but honestly how could you give this two stars.i decided to read the da vinci code a while back just to see what all the hubbub was about.	1
	it was fun, fast, even made me think and overall had some pretty nice twists and turns.	1
	however, it was not nearly as incredible as i was expecting it to be since it nearly outsold the bible or became the new bible to some people.	1
	that being said this follow up is probably one of the worst books i have read.	1
	i was a sucker and already spent the money, so i had to read it to the end.	1
	i can't even tell you how many times i shook my head while reading, out of pure disbelief of character reactions and plot points .	1
	honestly, the entire plot was pointless.	1
	i mean who really cares if masons make up a part of our government, like that would be a surprise to anyone to find out there are secret societies in washington.	1
	and honestly if the robert langdon is suppose to be this brilliant prof. from harvard why is he so dumb.	1
	why can't he make a decision and why is someone else always figuring it out first.	1
	actually everyone involved in this novel knows the secret already so what is the point of keeping it secret.	1
	i could watch national treasure one and two and enjoy it more than this book.	1
	sorry for the backhanded compliment national treasure.	1
	man this was an awful book and the last one i ever read from dan brown.        	1
	taken advantage of!	1
	!.i have really enjoyed dan brown's novels up to this point, maybe some of the plots were a bit far fetched, but not impossible.	1
	this book is not only implausible, but silly and way beyond possible!	1
	i feel like a bunch of ridiculous 'facts' were thrown at me in contrived situations just because the author could write most anything at this point and have a best seller.	1
	i wondered most of the time if he even had an editor and if he did had he graduated from grade school.	1
	some of the characters were so silly and situations so out there i wanted to scream and throw this book across the room, i think i did once, scared my dogs to death.	1
	if you want to know how bad a follow up can be by all means read this book, it is not worth the $9.99 though, get it from the library or off the street where someone like me has tossed it out the window in frustration!      	1
	a huge disappointment.lost symbol is a bad book.	1
	i agree with justin lee's comments on every point but this: it is a bad book.	1
	could it be rescued by a good editor?	1
	probably.	1
	i enjoyed davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	i did not enjoy lost symbol.	1
	characters are one dimensional, especially sato.	1
	in every conversation she has with langdon she acts like an idiot.	1
	the other characters are not any better, just different in their own one dimensional way.	1
	the book does not move; it is dull.	1
	it is tedious and repetitive.	1
	characters are constantly saying the same things: what the hell, what could it mean... mal'akh's tattoos are straight from michael's in prison break.	1
	dialogue and descriptions are so prosaic; the language is dead.	1
	there are some positives, however.	1
	the book's description of the library of congress is amazing; i was fascinated by drer's magic square and the allusion to alchemical principles including 'as above, so below'; and i enjoyed the historical evidence for the masonic involvements of america's founders.	1
	but the main published reviews are right about brown's reticence to tell us anything insightful about the masons.	1
	this book is just a huge disappointment.	1
	i will probably not read brown again.       	1
	more of the same in dan brown's latest comedy.like the davinci code, this book makes a great my first mystery for folks who aren't familiar with the genre.	1
	brown knows his audience well: the naive and gullible, and feeds them mysteries that aren't very mysterious, and puzzles that those familiar with mystery books will soon figure out.	1
	he doesn't write especially well, but the book is more of the same for those who liked the first two books, plus his computer novel.	1
	if you loved davinci code, you'll probably like this.	1
	but it won't inspire any clue tours around the nation's capital.      	1
	believe the critics.what can i say that the book critics have not already said about this latest novel by dan brown?	1
	it is a truly spectacular read.	1
	for masons, and particularly scottish rite masons, this book will touch upon your experiences in the fraternity and make you truly proud of who you are and your choice to enter freemasonry.for many of you who do not know much about the freemasons and what the organization is all about, this novel will clarify many misinterpretations that are floating around out there.	1
	eye-opening for those unaccustomed to the fraternity; reaffirming for those within it.even outside the interest of masonry, this novel is a great read: fast-paced and full of surprises.pick it up; you won't be disappointed.      	1
	absolute dreck!.i loved da vinci code so of course i had to read angels and demons.	1
	i knew it was an earlier book so i didn't expect it would be as good... and it wasn't - but it was still readable.	1
	finally dan brown has released a new book.	1
	i was so looking forward to 'lost symbol'.	1
	by now brown should be hitting his stride and symbol should have been his masterpiece.	1
	wow.	1
	total dreck.	1
	a mumbo-jumbo of b movie plot, pseudo-science and quasi-religion.	1
	if you took a few new age hippie manuals and a few pages from the bible and tossed them into a blender i'm sure it would be a more engrossing read.	1
	dan - based on da vinci code i let you sucker me into reading deception point and digital fortress.	1
	i struggled through angels and demons.	1
	but never again.	1
	you are a one hit wonder.	1
	i'm done with you!      	1
	what a disappointment!.	1
	lost symbol rather boring.i enjoyed da vinci code but not lost symbol.	1
	why?	1
	i don't know but it seemed too ludicrous.	1
	way too many close calls that didn't make sense as if dan brown was trying to cram as much as possible into one novel.	1
	it fell short and was not even close to being believable.	1
	there were loose ends, fragmented chapters, characters that were able to make sense of symbols that weren't even close to sensible.	1
	waste of money in my opinion.      	1
	just awful narration.i've given up trying to put up with this awful audio book.	1
	the narrator gives one of the worst performances i have ever listened to.	1
	i so very much wanted to enjoy this book on cd, but dan brown, as an author, fails miserably, in my humble opinion.	1
	for example, imagine sentences along the lines of, '...and suddenly a dark stranger appeared...' - if i had handed that in to my grade 6 english teacher, i'm sure i would have recieved a 'c-' grade.	1
	'lost symbol' is one big disappointment.	1
	try listening to a poor (male) narrator trying feebly to imitate a (female) throat cancer survivor's raspy voice - it's truly painful.	1
	do yourself a favor and give this one a big miss.      	1
	intriguing, yet excruciating.it's an okay, yet disappointing and aggravating read.	1
	mary pope osborne, the author of the children's magic treehouse series, does a better job of didactically presenting history in an adventure format.	1
	way too much padding.	1
	the surprises aren't surprising.	1
	the writing stinks.	1
	'langon pointed to a black shadow that was materializing on the lawn to their left.	1
	the shadow began as an amorphous blob, but it was growing quickly, moving in their direction, becoming more defined, rushing at them faster and faster, stretching, and finally transforming itself into a massive black triangle crowned by two impossibly tall spires.	1
	'the cathedral facade is blocking the searchlight,' langdon said.	1
	'they're landing out front!	1
	'langdon grabbed catherine's hand.	1
	'run!	1
	now!''	1
	the final revelation that throughout the book has everyone gasping and turning pale is laughable.	1
	the unbelievable cia chief is non-other than the costume designer from the cartoon movie, the incredibles.	1
	the main villain seems to be modeled after the villain character from the mummy movies.      	1
	lost symbol.i was disappointed with dan brown .	1
	i would title his book 'much ado about nothing' he creates an incredible monster who achieves nothing, seems pointless and who eventually peters out in bizarr circumstances.the ancient masonic symbol,central to this plot/story really turns out to be much ado about nothing also.	1
	so as a novel with suspence ,intrigue and a satisfying conclusion this mystery novel failed.i will give credit to dan brown for his knowledge on masonic practises and the layuot of washington d.c      	1
	was intriguing until....i was pretty captivated by the story (albeit same formula as his others) until the climax.	1
	i don't understand why the climax was followed by pages and pages of blather.	1
	the characters seemed to carry on as if they had not been traumatized with the threat of death during the last several hours.	1
	i kept reading in hopes of another plot point or twist, but none came.	1
	i think mr. brown's a bit self-serving to go on and on.	1
	ultimately, i would not recommend this book.	1
	i had hoped for something more satisfying through to the end.      	1
	there's better reading out there.this is the davinci code set in washington,dc.	1
	langdon is goofy.	1
	the bad guy is so obvious that it's amazing that all these really smart people couldn't catch on to him.	1
	the ending is particularly annoying.	1
	it's a work of fiction, a story and it annoys me when people try to pass off their religious views in dialogue between two fictional characters.	1
	there is plenty of better reading out there.	1
	don't waste your money just because it's a dan brown book.	1
	i made that mistake on john grisham's last book too, buying because it was john grisham and wasted a weekend on his last contractual obligation.	1
	i'll be looking for debut novels for a while!      	1
	a dreadful, unfortunately not a penny dreadful.if you can read without moving your lips you will be able to call every plot twist and turn in dan brown's predictable, overwrought, dreadful continuation of the robert langdon saga.	1
	in fact i almost cheered when robert langdon 'died', but alas, we are not that fortunate.	1
	a 500+ page marketing pamphlet for freemasonry?	1
	a derivative mish-mash of other novels?	1
	the last gasp of a tired writer with a tired character?	1
	the conceit of cramming everything into a narrow 10-hour timeframe seemed more contrived this time around.	1
	the problem with a series is that often, by the fifth or sixth novel, the author has had his say.	1
	there is nothing more that can be said about the main character.	1
	brown has managed to reach this plateau in three books.	1
	the only redeeming feature is that i bought the book on kindle.	1
	no tree died in the writing of this review.      	1
	knowledge gained, time lost.i am a dan brown fan and have read the da vinci code 4 times and will definitely read it again after the disappointment i experienced in the lost symbol.	1
	i have had a fascination for the masonic order all my life since my father was a 33rd degree mason and was installed as worthy master of his lodge.	1
	he was also a shriner.	1
	he would never answer my questions about masonry which always fueled my fascination.	1
	so here i thought dan brown was going to finally answer some of my life long questions and i couldn't have been more thrilled.brown rambled on and on about the lost mysteries and the lost word and the bible being the true vessel of the ancient wisdom.	1
	i recently spent several hours reading the bible and i think you can mold your understanding of that great book depending on your personal perspective.	1
	i got caught up in the historical details and of course the psalms and the prophets.	1
	contrary to many believers, there are other great works of wisdom.	1
	i am not certain if the masonic rituals mr. brown depicted are accurate or not, but he wrote at the beginning that all the agencies and things he were about to reveal were true.	1
	i have to do my own research now for sure.	1
	this was a page turner because the chapters were so short, but the villain, mal'ok was not entirely believable.	1
	and i was disappointed with his great revelation at the end  of his place in the story.	1
	he was thoroughly flawed and broken in some perverse way.	1
	i think we readers could have done very well without his revelation and accepted him as just a sick and flawed individual.	1
	robert langdon was just too obtuse and handled his skepticism poorly he refused to 'get it', whatever 'it was supposed to be about the symbolon and the codes on the pyramid.	1
	this book is not one i would read again.	1
	i hope brown's next novel is more believable.	1
	i was disappointed overall.	1
	i also thought the ending dragged on at least 40 pages longer than it needed to.	1
	i kept waiting for it to end.	1
	the book could have used some thorough pruning with a grease pencil.      	1
	the lost kindle.i got the kindle edition of the the lost symbol.	1
	my masonic friends all got the paperback edition.	1
	i was disappointed that only the major (plot specific) artwork was included in the kindle release.	1
	the masonic symbols on the map of washington d.c. for instance....was briefly touched on in the text, and, since it was not crucial to the plot, did not appear in my version.	1
	do i feel cheated?	1
	i paid less, but; the publisher didn't have to print a physical book to get my money.	1
	this new release was kindle priced, $9.99 pricey, considering they expect to now sell [pre-sale] ink & paper books at $8.88, or so.	1
	the kindle dictionary does not automatically update, and have found stopping reading to look up an obtuse word, only to have it not listed, a little frustrating.	1
	[happens with kafka, too.]	1
	the navigation was as expected, and the 'notes and marks' feature was very handy, [multiple marks, returning to illustrations, dog ear-ing pages, and highlights...] as if this title demanded the feature... the story has been hit on in many reviews.	1
	go, with my blessing, and read those.	1
	my only qualm, was the 'episcopal priest and mason.'	1
	it is possible he was a freemason before being ordained.	1
	but, it is my understanding that episcopal clergy are dis-allowed to enter the masonic fraternity.	1
	the descriptions of the buildings, in explicit details, do not have the plot-slowing effect of other tomes; the details are incorporated into the action/plot lines.	1
	was this a screenplay?.the lost symbol reads as though it was written for a screenplay, and not the big screen, but a 30 minute television show.	1
	brown goes into great detail about the locations and how one gets from point a to point b, but does very little to build the characters in the novel.	1
	his antagonist is a weak, insane sad case of a person, his protagonist is a puppet all through the novel, never taking a position on the white horse, but always being the pawn of other players.	1
	the rolling of all of the events of the tale into a single night is incredulous.	1
	the cia supervisor is a far less than believable character.	1
	all in all, this was a disappointing follow up to the davinci code.	1
	it was a 30 minute story crammed into over 100 chapters of a book.      	1
	the lost time.that was the most long winded book i have ever read.	1
	i skimmed the last few chapters because he had pounded that conversation into our heads throughout the entire book.	1
	the unnecessary business concerning noetic science served absolutely no purpose in advancing in the story.	1
	i kept saying out loud to my husband 'when does this story end?'.	1
	to dan brown's credit, he does include historical background in his books that enhance and enrich the stories.	1
	but, dear god, get to the point!	1
	i loved 'the da vinci code' and so i am disappointed with this latest tome.      	1
	disappointing and predictable.i loved the two previous books and couldn't wait for this one.	1
	i was sorely disappointed.	1
	it is clear that brown did his research, but he also gets carried away sometimes.	1
	while in the airplane, the main character hears the xyz engines slow down.	1
	like he would know, or care, the name of the manufacturer of the plane's engine.	1
	minor issue but distracting nonetheless.	1
	the book is full of action and is very suspenseful in true dan brown fashion.	1
	however, i figured out the identity of the book's villain fairly rapidly.	1
	it was predictable and a common thread in many fictional stories.	1
	he did his usually excellent job of painting a picture for us with words.	1
	i could easily visualize all the buildings and locations he described.	1
	unfortunately, this was all tossed out the window when the big national security issue threat is revealed.	1
	had i not been reading this on my kindle, i would've tossed it in frustration.	1
	it was, frankly,  stupid.	1
	a man this creative couldn't come up with something better?	1
	in my opinion this is a book you can totally skip.	1
	or at least check it out from the library so you don't want any money on it.      	1
	i really wish it were better.i really pity dan brown his success.	1
	having achieved a thrilling formula in the davinci code, he seems intent on reusing it here with little effect.	1
	i loved the davinci code, for all its flaws.	1
	it was fun.	1
	this book is not fun.	1
	i hate the villain, not in the good way either.	1
	he bores me.	1
	i am tired of the damsel and the professor routine.	1
	the dialog is thin.	1
	the langdon character seems dumbed down, caricatured.	1
	the surprises are not surprises, the riddles are too formulaic.	1
	all in all, it flopped.	1
	i am sorry dan.	1
	i don't mean to criticize.	1
	it is just that i waited so long to be taken on this ride, and paid my money for it, and here i am trudging my way through this lesser work.	1
	i can only imagine the pressure put on you to write the next great novel.	1
	it didn't happen this time.	1
	i get this vague feeling you weren't ready to write this book, that this book was not from your soul the way your last was.	1
	this feels like your publisher made you do it, or maybe this was written to be the next movie.	1
	it simply wasn't written from inspiration, or that is the way it seems.	1
	that all said, i think dan will be back, and bring us something more worthy next time.	1
	i will buy your book, and forget this one, and hope that the next ride is thriller.	1
	keep at it dan.      	1
	another so so book from a so so writer.i don't know why, but i have read all of the dan brown catalog and every time i finish a book i think 'why is this man so famous?	1
	and why did i bother to finish this mediocre book?'	1
	sure mr. brown does his research and develops some good story ideas - but his characters are so one dimensional and plots have become rather formulaic.	1
	i can't say i would recommend this book.	1
	if someone really wanted to read a dan brown book i would say read angels and demons and move on to a better writer.       	1
	very disappointing ending, and book.recognizing it is tough to follow his two prior hits, but this fell flat.	1
	after ~300 pages, i was bored, but kept hoping for an exiting turn.	1
	@400 pages, hope was fading, but i thought, surely it will end well.	1
	@500 i found myself reading what seemed like an explanation of the 'lost word' thinking: you have got to be kidding.	1
	way too thin a connection.	1
	it would be unreasonable to ask amazon to refund me my time spent on this, but really it was annoying.      	1
	the lost story.the lost symbol can easily be described as the most highly anticipated book since the last harry potter, maybe even more so.	1
	its first initial print run is 6.5 million copies and it is poised to be just as big as its predecessor, the davinci code which sold over 40 million copies.	1
	unfortunately, it's nowhere near as good (as i recall) as its predecessor, in fact, it's downright bad.	1
	the lost symbol brings the eagerly awaited return of brown's hero robert langdon.	1
	this time he finds himself investigating secrets hidden in our own capital in order to rescue a friend from a deranged madman.	1
	this time he deals with the legendary, and oft discussed, masons.	1
	the secrets brown discusses here on their own would be fascinating but for some reason everything we get here is rather bland and well almost boring.	1
	the bloated novel runs over 500 pages, most of which seem like the same four or five scenes over and over again.	1
	langdon states that whatever it is they're discussing is a myth or a metaphor, someone else says they can prove it, and langdon has his mind blown.	1
	the main villain seems like he is crafted specifically for the inevitable film adaptation and his revelations are so predictable that i had it figured out almost instantaneously.	1
	it's a wildly overblown plot that is stretched out to its absolute limits to give the illusion of an epic when the actual quality is barely better than a $.99 trashy pulp novel.	1
	even scenes that were meant to be shocking were downright laughable.	1
	sure the history is interesting, but the information around it was so heavy handed and poorly constructed that it makes one wonder what the fuss was about.	1
	this is what we've been waiting six years for?	1
	such a massive let down.	1
	here is the worst part: the lost symbol has the single biggest cop out ending i have ever read.	1
	don't worry i won't spoil it but my reaction was 'wtf?	1
	are you #(*$#($# kidding me?	1
	really?	1
	really?	1
	this is what we get?'	1
	that may be paraphrased for humor.	1
	then again it might not be.	1
	i've never thought that dan brown was a literary master but i did enjoy his previous works.	1
	i don't know what's different now but i can see now that he's just not that good at all.	1
	one of the most annoying parts of the lost symbol is how much the characters think dialogue.	1
	i don't know if he thinks this kind of thing is natural or what but it is downright bothersome in the book.	1
	the lost symbol will be a massive hit, that is for sure, but it really is one of the biggest disappointments the literary world has spewed out in this critic's recent memory.	1
	if you are so inclined, and honestly, i hope you aren't, the lost symbol is in stores now.	1
	[...]      	1
	not quite what i expected.it had a good beginning.	1
	my grandfather was a free mason and i remember the stories of secrecy,so i was fascinated by the topic of this book.	1
	however, i quickly got bogged down until the end.	1
	it seemed so far-fetched, sensational and wordy, that i got impatient.	1
	it was not the page-turner i expected.	1
	finally, i skimmed through to the end which turned out to be redeeming.	1
	the ending brought it all together - finally!	1
	it just took too long to get there.	1
	based on other reviews, i deliberately read this first, before the davinci code since so many of those reviews said it was hard to top, and that this one didn't.	1
	i shall see whether i agree!	1
	a lost writer.michael dunlang had a hunch.	1
	the unquestionably brilliant literary professor usually didn't bother with barnes and noble, preferring the superior and arcane selections of amazon, but if nothing else, he could enjoy a cappuccino with the masses at starbucks.suddenly, dunlang spied an endcap and froze in his tracks.	1
	[italic] my god!	1
	it's the new dan brown novel!	1
	[end italic] dunlang knew that hidden within the book was the secret to the universe.	1
	five years of seclusion had brought it all together.	1
	only the most intelligent mind would be able to unravel it.	1
	fortunately, tweed-jacketed dunlang had such a mind.	1
	[italic] look at them.	1
	they have no idea what's in here.	1
	[end italic] dunlang grabbed a newspaper from the newsstand and nonchalantly grabbed the novel, quickly wrapping it in the newspaper.	1
	he didn't want to be recognized as he excitedly sat down at a corner chair.	1
	[italic] soon, all be revealed.	1
	[end italic] dunlang, of course, knew the code rested in the italicized text.	1
	it was the keystone to an unbelievably powerful technology.	1
	[italic] the power to read minds.	1
	imagine if this fell into the wrong hands!	1
	[end italic]      	1
	bad packaging poorly written story line..the initial shipment of this book was delivered destroyed.	1
	the package was bent through the middle at about 40 degrees.	1
	however, amazon did ship a replacement right away upon my telephone call.	1
	as to the book i believe this was dan brown's poorest novel to date.	1
	it seems as if he rushed it to print with a rather disjointed story line and just much less effort than previous novels.	1
	found this book to be mediocre at the best.      	1
	entertaining but that's it.even if dan brown can turn ordinary themes into 'frantic' persecutions and compress events of one single night into a whole book, lost symbol is probably not his best work.	1
	i got the feeling he was giving too much unnecessary details to try to fill pages and make it longer and more complex.	1
	i got tired of 'running' around d.c. and its landmarks with no known purpose.	1
	brown stretches his imagination sometimes to the border of credibility, or just trying to make it interesting for the reader.	1
	most of the time it did not work for me.	1
	i will probably buy his next book as well, but maybe if i don't expect as much as i did from this one, i just might enjoy a bit more.       	1
	beware!.let me start by saying i enjoyed the da vinci code.	1
	the subject matter was thought provoking, and caused a few ruffles in religious circles.	1
	i enjoyed angels and demons just as much (i read them backwards...wasn't really aware of angels and demons until after i read the da vinci code).	1
	i think the dan brown streak has ended with the lost symbol.	1
	the subject matter just isn't exciting enough for a page-turning type of book.	1
	it just isn't.	1
	i'm not going to give away any of the plot or 'secrets' here, but take my word for it, it just doesn't satisfy.	1
	the only reason i read it to the end is because i was hoping for something more.	1
	and i didn't get the satisfactory ending i was hoping for.	1
	i was kind of expecting it might not be all it was cracked up to be, so i took the book out from the library (don't ask me how i got it the first week....i didn't reserve it, and walked in that week and was able to take it out).	1
	i recommend doing this so you don't waste your money.	1
	i really wanted to like it, but i just couldn't take it seriously.	1
	i'm not a 'basher' of books; if i like it, i will say so.	1
	but this one was hard to swallow.	1
	proceed with caution!      	1
	one wikipedia article said to the other....if you can get over the fact that the novel at times reads like a george lucas penned dialogue of two wikipedia articles talking to each other and way too many cheesy melodramatic cliffhangers that leave you with winks, sly smiles, blank stares, clichs, and unanswered questions every time brown switches scenes like a dukes of hazzard commercial break, then you will enjoy this book.	1
	fortunately, although it was hard at times, i was able to get through these massive faults which do, thankfully, slow down towards the last half of the novel once the mason back-story is established and all of the characters end up more or less in the same location.	1
	but we do not watch star wars or read dan brown, john grisham, and tom clancy for their high art; we read them for their escapist abilities to thrill us with adventure, mythology, and intrigue.	1
	dan brown is the go to guy for conspiracy theory mysteries these days and he once again doesn't disappoint in this aspect of the story.	1
	the problems surround his need to educate the lay reader in all of the back-story surrounding the masons which creates the previously mentioned clunky wikipedia-type conversations on almost every other page for the first half of the novel.	1
	i wish that he would have let some of the back-story just remain unknown to the uneducated like he did in the da vinci code.	1
	or if he felt that it was critical to the plot development just put it in a footnote or an annotated web link on the book's webpage.	1
	point those that need the added information in the right direction, but don't train wreck your character development and flow to 'teach' your reader in the middle of a scene.	1
	i assume that all of the delays in this book's publication (2 years later than advertised) were due to his trying to fold into the novel all of the background knowledge about the masons that an uneducated reader would need to understand the story.	1
	what brown has going for him, which saves the novel from becoming a complete train wreck, is the fact that robert langdon's character has already been developed to the point that we care about him in previous novels.	1
	i also see that more than one reviewer has pointed out the many, many similarities between mal'akh and francis dolarhyde from thomas harris's the red dragon which i think brown should have anticipated and gone to greater lengths to eliminate.	1
	with all its faults i was still pulled in enough to listen to the audiobook's 17 hrs and 51 mins in five days.	1
	i walked away from the novel intrigued about the masons, noetic science, and more importantly entertained which is all that i can ask of this type of novel.       	1
	predictable.another robert langdon adventure from dan brown.	1
	same slightly lame story (a frantic scavenger hunt for information with a hot babe for a sidekick...an attempt to save a pretty good guy from a wicked bad guy [who, again, was physically odd looking and crazy] before the clock runs out and utter disaster befalls the world as we know it) filled with interesting and fun factoids and ideas (noetic science, universal consciousness, 'secrets' of the freemasons).	1
	that the story took place in d.c and had lots of historical references made my nerdy little presidential-trivia loving heart go pitter pat, and almost made up for the disappointment of figuring out the big 'surprise' halfway through the book.	1
	fun, but definitely predictable.	1
	hopefully the next robert langdon story will have a different plot...if not it will undoubtedly be the last i read.      	1
	an incredible disappointment!	1
	!.like most of the literate public, i cheered and eagerly awaited mr. brown latest effort.	1
	i love the da vinci code and had read it in first printing.	1
	the movie was absolutely awful, which took much of the glow off the book.	1
	the lost symbol simply stinks.	1
	i read it all out of an ill-considered optimism.	1
	it still stank.	1
	i will not likely buy his books in the future.	1
	if i hadn't pre-ordered it, after reading maureen dowd's review in the nytrb, i probably could have saved $20.	1
	'a must to avoid'.      	1
	my last dan brown book!.this is my last dan brown book!	1
	not only is the bloom off the rose for this genre, but i think the entire plant has died.	1
	i enjoy a good romp outside of 'realistic' boundaries, but this is just so obviously a contrived, and unbelievable, story, that i could hardly finish it.	1
	anyway, the devinci code was terrific.	1
	the lost symbol is rubbish!	1
	i wish dan luck in his next line of work.      	1
	cheap thrills.another reviewer nailed it when they described this book as reading more like a screenplay than a novel.	1
	expectations were higher than what this book delivered.	1
	if i wanted kitsch, i'd have read a james patterson novel.	1
	should have just let robert langdon die, bringing him back from the dead at the end was.... cheap.	1
	the subject matter and the talent of the author, combined with the hoopla surrounding this book's release, really set me up for a letdown.        	1
	it took him how long to write this tripe?.thankfully, i bought this book for my kindle so i only paid $9.99, and even that was too much.	1
	if i had paid for a hardcover copy, i would be really upset.	1
	plastic characters, unrealistic dialogue, boring lectures on the masons...after suffering through all that, there are no 'answers', just some kind of fluff ending that i guess is supposed to make you feel good, but only made me glad it was the last page.	1
	as preposterous as his premise was for the davinci code, he at least gave you something to think about and some fun puzzles to follow to the ending.	1
	not so with the lost symbol.      	1
	when did dan brown's characters get so dumb?.while the story was decent, i found myself more often than not yelling at my cd player (i listened to this on my commute).	1
	nearly every character in this book stood baffled and idiotic for the entirety of this book.	1
	robert langdon is the weakest hero ever to be in a book and i was dissappointed that katherine didn't at least step up and take the place of the hero.	1
	in the end, while i really like dan brown's work (particularly his earlier books), this really felt like he was showing off all his research.	1
	i also felt like either dan brown thinks his readers are stupid, or the editor did, because we were re-indroduced to things time and time again and they had to be defined in full each time they were brought up.	1
	after one explination of noetic science, i didn't need it to be explained in full each time it was mentioned.      	1
	passable but not his best, it borrows from da vinci code's ideas.it was a good read.	1
	i started slow but then the book drew me in, and frankly, i just wanted to finish it.	1
	it's a long one indeed.	1
	the scrambling from place to place and deciphering stuff is all too much of a copy-down from da vinci code days.	1
	i know that's the genre, but it's a little too close for my own liking.	1
	at least with say digital fortress, dan explored a new kind of fast-pace problem.the end of the book (i won't tell don't worry) is a little tacky, in that it brings to bear a sense of the current political changes we see (ie new president).one other point:  this is fiction, but i'm sure, like his other books, people will take it to be solid-gold fact about the true world we all see.	1
	it isn't, folks.	1
	a hefty supposition or two is made about spirituality and it might disturb some people.	1
	the idea about the nature of the soul that the book touches on has actually been discredited in science.	1
	so read this as fiction: it's still good, not dan's best, but is worth the purchasing price.	1
	just don't take it seriously.	1
	even if we think the idea is true that powerful people network together, well, it shouldn't surprise us so much should it?	1
	throughout eons humans have done this same behavior, foolishly or to great effect, and i think that is the book's other message.of course you may find other 'messages' or 'morals' from it.	1
	happy reading!      	1
	star wars with twists?	1
	plagiarism?.there was nothing in this that i did not anticipate way before the storyline was exposed... all the 'twists' fell flat and i have to rate this low.	1
	the ending is particularly disappointing in its preachy tone; brown seems to be building up to his own patentable 'religion' much like the celestine prophecy... but what was most cheesy was the fact that the story mirrors the old star wars story of father and son discovering each other in a battle of good vs evil... except this time its the father with the hand cut off... the text even mentions darth vader, so perhaps brown was under its influence in creating this storyline... it's almost plagiarism... and finally, surely there has to be worse prisons than the ones in turkey, especially one just outside istanbul?	1
	cheesy, cliched and unimaginative to the extreme...       	1
	end of the trilogy ... please!.the da vinci code was good.	1
	angels and demons was not so good.	1
	the lost symbol, the third book in this trilogy (and hopefully the last) is not good at all.	1
	it is tedious, boring and its obvious formulaic similarity to the prior robert langdon books is just too much.	1
	it is not that dan brown cannot write.	1
	he has the technical tools.	1
	i fear the problem has become that he is overly enamored with writing about things in the minutest detail to show that he has been thorough in his research.	1
	so what.	1
	minutiae does not equate with a good read.	1
	almost anyone, with sufficient time and interest can research anything on the internet these days.	1
	and, this fascination with masonry has grown very tiresome.	1
	per his usual formula, he has a sadistic, monomaniacal antagonist, who is set on wreaking havoc of one sort or another in a plodding, methodical way.	1
	langdon must figure out what is going on and put a halt to the nefarious plot.	1
	simple enough in principle, but brown's tiresome discourses on various and sundry things having nothing much to do with the plot makes this book nearly impossible to read.	1
	the book seems cold and i could not become engaged with the characters at all.	1
	sadly, all of brown's works reflect a similar writing style.	1
	when you pick one up and open it you know you are going to get something remarkably like on of his other works.	1
	that does not speak well for an author.	1
	compare dan brown to elmore leonard and you will see just what i mean.	1
	give it a miss.      	1
	i agree 100% with justin lee.i don't have much to say that has not already been said by justin lee (the first reviewer).	1
	he nailed everything i was thinking, plus some things i had not bothered to think about but i completely agree.	1
	is the book a good read?	1
	sure.	1
	but when readers' expectations are so high based on the author's previous books, all that matters is filling our expectations.	1
	i think brown missed out on that.	1
	it seems he was more focused on what the publisher wanted or maybe anticipating the movie deal rather than remaining pure to his work.       	1
	this is not a good book!.the plot is crazy, the characters very poorly drawn and not at all believable.	1
	(how could the saintly peter solomon have such a ghastly child?)	1
	i could have tolerated all this had the book been any fun to read, but it just wasn't.	1
	and did anyone else notice that the word 'elegant' is used ad nauseum?	1
	did you use your kindergartner to edit this one, or just phone it in?	1
	i wish i'd donated the money i spent on this book to a local food bank instead.      	1
	somewhat disappointing.well, we all knew it - the davinci code would be almost impossible to surpass.	1
	while brown's follow up story is interesting and informative, i suddenly realized that langdon is boring.	1
	boring, boring, boring.	1
	he spouts informative tidbits throughout the book but seems a little, oh i don't know, souless.	1
	i guess the only reason i finished the book was because i was really wanting the other shoe to drop and thoroughly surprise me.	1
	ho hum!      	1
	noetic rantings in book form.i've read all dan's books (even the one on cryptology 'digital fortress' - btw, i think that was his best) and did like the da vinci code very much.	1
	but the lost symbol has moved away from some of his best writing and seems to be more of a platform to expound upon his personal beliefs.	1
	in fact, from chapter 125 on, the remainder of the book is just a story form of a manual on noetics.	1
	i believe dan is trying to push a bit of his personal views in a fictional book - not the first time, of course, but more blatantly then ever before.	1
	if you read it, then you will read the entire book.	1
	but you will look back and wonder why the last 8th of the books was even included, other than for dan's rantings.      	1
	the lost symbol.i am 3/4 of the way through this book and at this point i am sorely disappointed.	1
	the story is stuck in the midst of the most macabre, cold-blooded and disgustingly brutal scenarios since silence of the lambs.	1
	this is not at all what i expected from dan brown and i am seriously considering whether or not i even want to finish the book.	1
	the murders and torture methods are beyond disturbing and don't really add anything to the story except the strong desire to have it over with.	1
	at this point i don't even care what the damn lost symbol is!	1
	i have to say that, sadly, i wouldn't even recommend this book to anyone that i know.	1
	gruesome does not appeal to me.just for the record: loved davinci code and angels and demons despite the fair amount of brutality.      	1
	lost ability to entertain.first, let me say that writing a review on dan brown's books is almost by definition a waste of time: there is no way to convince hard fans to not spend money on it; also, there is no way to convince some of my elitist friends that his books are worth even the cost of paper on which they are printed.	1
	why am i doing it, then?	1
	mainly because i switched camps: while i found the 'davinci code' and 'angels and demons' reasonably entertaining, with 'lost symbol' my ratings of dan brown's books fall to all-time low.despite many drawbacks, the previous books had a redeeming quality; they had fast-moving story, based on more or less plausible logic and some more or less believable idea.	1
	in other words, they were fun to read.	1
	'lost symbol' lacks even this.	1
	well, the 'fast-moving' part is still here; but it is essentially a series of episodes, connected (or not) in time and place by some far-fetched logic.based on my previous experience, when i bought 'ls', i didn't expect the nobel-prize literature winner, but i did expect to be entertained.	1
	instead, i began to speed-read and skip pages after first 50 pages.	1
	as for the idea, i got the feeling that if professor langdon read the 'secret', he wouldn't be looking for a secret of lost symbol.	1
	apparently, dan brown was too busy trying to squeeze 10 years of masonic research into one mass market volume, to pay attention to other things happening in the world.	1
	for example, 'energy of thoughts' and 'law of attraction' became such a table talk subjects in the last couple of years that they lost any appeal as part of high intrigue and sacred secrets moving the book plot.	1
	on the positive side: first, i do expect a lot of tourists coming to washington, dc in next couple of years; this definitely would help the economy of the region.	1
	second, i don't know much about masons, except of basic common knowledge facts.	1
	now i am curious enough to pick more serious reference book and read more.	1
	no doubt, many people would do just the same.	1
	considering the amount of pre-conceptions regarding masons and their role in our society, the increased public awareness is definitely a positive outcome of the book.	1
	in conclusion, no matter how implausible brown's theories are, i appreciate the amount of research that he does before getting his books published.	1
	i just wish this time it were translated into more interesting story.	1
	whitewash of darkside of freemasonry.i recently read dan brown's new novel.	1
	it was a great disappointment; similar in style to the previous davinci code, but worse, with more foul language profanity, and a whitewash of the dark side of freemasonry, with very little light about the secrets of freemasonry.	1
	nothing about how the freemasonry secrecy oaths often lead to criminal conspiracies involving freemasons; not to mention its intent to destroy and replace christianity.	1
	furthermore, dan brown either does not understand the lost word symbolism of freemasonry, or he is being intentionally deceptive, a common trait of freemasonry. 	1
	i want this week of my life back.i enjoyed the da vinci code, but more for the mystery and the plot line than the characters.	1
	strangely, in that book, it was not langdon's character that caught my minds eye, but rather the french police woman, sophie(?).	1
	'the lost symbol' fails in my opinion in both plot and character development.	1
	by the time i finished this book i was just begging for it to be over.	1
	character dialogue (both spoken and silent) is stiff, unrealistic, and very cliche.	1
	this results in characters with no depth, or complexity.	1
	there wasn't a realistic character in the bunch.	1
	the wandering, almost stream-of-consciousness, plot-line was never well defined.	1
	when the story finally revealed the nature of the 'national security emergency' which drove the inoue sato character, i found myself physically shaking my head thinking 'i turned hundreds of pages, for this!?'.	1
	in the end, this book was filled with example after example of similarly disappointing 'eureka moments' that gave me the same empty feeling.	1
	read it if you must, but temper your expectations.        	1
	like reading a harlequin novel.i stopped reading this book after 50 pages.	1
	it is so boringly formulaic and the writing is so poor that i could not continue.	1
	the book is full of nonsense platitudes like 'and he knew that he alone had the secret that would make him incalculably powerful'  or junk like 'he rushed into the atrium, maneuvering his six-foot-three body with agility, glancing back just once to catch a glimpse of yadda yadda' or 'he knew that all his preparation would soon pay off in a way that no one in the world could have predicted or would ever know' it's full of people running.	1
	chases.	1
	chapters ending with sentences like 'all would soon become clear'  and 'he knew that his next step would determine whether he lived or died' it's cotton candy reading.	1
	ernest hemingway this isn't.	1
	it's as if bart simpson wrote a novel.	1
	it's dante's inferno without dante or the inferno, just leaving me in hell.      	1
	the gullibility test.the renowned dan brown has finally done it.	1
	he has taken... - conspiracy theories and urban legends- pseudo-technical mumbo-jumbo- one dimensional characters with a one-track mind- people so intelligent that they are really dumb- plot twists that wouldn't fool a six year old- annoying mini-cliffhangers every two pages- abduction/torture/investigation sequences out of c-grade movies- a treasure map and a wild goose chase- mystical religious references- wikipedia conversation mode- recycle storyline from the previously successful versions of the gullibility test- many more annoying literary elements and factual errors than can be listed here ... and he has invented the ultimate gullibility test.	1
	the shocking truth is that this gullibility test really works.	1
	it separates the gullible for the shrewd like wheat from chaff.	1
	the most amazing part is the gullibility test started working even before it was made public.	1
	people all over the world voluntarily queued up to part with their hard earned money and prove how gullible they were.	1
	dan brown in his great wisdom has named this ultimate test, the lost symbol.	1
	if it's isn't obvious, the lost symbol is certified baloney of the 33rd degree.  	1
	disappointing.i had quite a big expectations after reading da vinchi code and angels and demons, but this books is not at all up to the mark.	1
	the essence of the book was good but i felt the writing was weak and the end was bad.	1
	the villain character, i felt was totally stupid, i mean how can he hide his full tattooed body with the make up?	1
	robert drowned but yet he's still alive that was a biggest put off and some more things like that.	1
	i don't think that its worth spending money and time.      	1
	two dimensional....this book never really 'jelled' for me, possibly because i live just outside of dc and commute there everyday, but probably because it just wasn't  a compelling scenario.	1
	but i kept reading, because i was hoping for a revelation moment, or something that would be a moment when i was hooked, like i was in the davinci code.	1
	the writer tried too hard, and i felt i was in a prep for a movie, not in a movie.	1
	characters like the cia domina-- please neither sinister nor believable.	1
	what did all the description of her add to the story-- nothing, i'd rather have known why the heck the cia was leading the case investigation.	1
	the disappointment at the end of the book...rarely felt before.	1
	langston was a real goofy protaganist - i felt like i was in one of my eighth grade constitution classes at times.	1
	the motivation for the evil character's evil was, well, mundane.	1
	heck the whole build up to the fearful why, was somewhat tedious and frankly not shocking in this world.	1
	sadly, none of the characters came off the page- they stayed in the two dimensions of letters on a page.	1
	oh well, i read deception point too, and it didn't kill me.	1
	or apparently teach me a lesson about reading books that don't grab me.	1
	just wish i could get those 5 hours of my life back.	1
	and i bought this book for many of my relatives... they're probably going to want their time back also.	1
	and i'm going to hear about it for months.         	1
	very disappointed.a very taut thriller - and as usual, each chapter ends with a dramatic flourish.	1
	a lot of interesting facts (ala the da vinci code), so you learn a lot.	1
	but the story is outlandish - even for dan brown.	1
	at the end, you wonder.....'is this it???'.	1
	is it worth reading, i guess so....as a merely above average novel.	1
	but is it a great book ?	1
	not at all.	1
	i got it as it came out, and was sorely disappointed.	1
	dan brown should just retire, and live off his earnings from the previous books he has written, and stop bothering us with such drivel.       	1
	the lost symbol very so-so.book was ok, too much detail on things we don't know, unlike davinci code where we already have a good idea of davinci, the last supper, the holy grail, etcsome of the plot twists you can see from at least 3 miles awaybut, brown still has talent, so the end result is fine      	1
	politics as usual.the good news, it's a quick read.	1
	not too detailed with new info...short pithy chapters...few characters (all true to stereotypes)...an evil dude (tatooed and insane).	1
	the bads news, yawn.	1
	i found my immediate impression was, 'so what?'	1
	was an undercover masonic initiation video really going to bring down the world?	1
	not.	1
	i enjoyed his other books where he seemed to weave a story with more substance.	1
	oh well, he'll still make millions and this may be another movie.	1
	but the real message is clear.	1
	propaganda is rampant with the 'arts' community.	1
	is dan brown the ultimate drone?	1
	ending the entire novel with 'hope'?      	1
	something old, something new???	1
	?.i am half way through the book and so far i am disapointed.	1
	first it is the da vince code with some modifications.	1
	professor meets up with girl being chased by insane man while searching for evidence of secret pyramid made by the freemasons, hero does not believe in the secret (of course even though he found christs daughter in his last adventure, saved a pope in an adventure before that, but is still skeptical about a secret mason pyramid) our hero is a bit out of character in this thriller.	1
	brown is into a formula i fear... sigh.	1
	so keep your expectations about this being another da vince code down, way down.	1
	otherwise you will not be happy.	1
	oh and i got my copy from the library.	1
	if i would have paid for it, i would have been jumping mad.	1
	but since i got it at no cost, i am ok with it so far.	1
	i will keep reading and update at the end of the book      	1
	something lost, perhaps?.it was touted by so many to be dan brown's best novel ever.	1
	while very good, with the intrique, twists and turns of every dan brownnovel, i did not find it to be the best ever of mr. brown's mystery novels.	1
	of the several dan brown novels i have read, 'angels and demons' ranks asthe best, followed by 'the da vinci code'.	1
	still, i would recommend 'lost symbol' for all who savor mystery novels writtenin the compelling, intriquing style of authors like dan brown and my all timefavorite author of mystery novels, eric ambler, who also had many of his novels made into movies.	1
	one test of a spell binding, intriquing mystery novel?one finds it very difficult to put the book down at the end of a chapter.	1
	'lost symbol' passes this test.	1
	norm	1
	decent, not grand, but still brown.if anything, dan brown is a vivid storyteller.	1
	it's the way he tells the story that can either be so wonderful (da vinci code) or rather mundane (the lost symbol).	1
	this story is interested, albeit a bit too long for its content.	1
	cut 100 pages and this might have the same pacing as da vinci code.	1
	but, alas, it doesn't, and here we have it in all its bulk.	1
	and the massive use of italics is enough to drive you batty.	1
	it's worth reading at, say $9 (read the news), but not worth running out and buying like a couple million of us already have at regular price.       	1
	lost symbol.i did not enjoy this book as much as dan brown's others, especially just having finished angels and demons, which i thought was outstanding.	1
	this book had way too much scientific jargon, along with leaving me with the idea that there was going to be some huge revelation at the end of the story.	1
	very disappointing.	1
	not sure i would recommend it as a good read.	1
	too much hype for the little bit of story behind it.      	1
	disappointed.i waited for this book with grat anticipation, but as i began reading it i found that most of the info was based on much of non-fiction books i have read over the past few years.	1
	i kept waiting for a  aha moment but it never came.	1
	i felt the book was a let down after his other langdon books.	1
	i get a sense that dan brown had read the same non-fiction books i had read and turned them into a novel.	1
	sorry mr. brown but i was not impressed.	1
	j.l.       	1
	dissapointing.#minor spoilers ahead# this is a dissapointing book given the long time that passed since the previous installment.	1
	it is understood that during this time dan brown had to deal with his huge unexpected success, be involved in two movies etc.	1
	still i would have hoped after all this time to see a book a bit more mature and interesting.	1
	without repeating to much what other reviewers are said, brown shows again he knows how to keep suspense and draw the user into a shadowy world of unknown history, esoteric trivia and mystery.	1
	however at the end all these does not add up into a meaningful message, and the reader is left with a feeling of 'why did i bother'.	1
	it seems that brown lost much of his talent to create real surprise in his plot devices.	1
	many of the plot twists and turns are so expected that they can be detected many chapters before they are actually revealed.	1
	unlike in dvc which was provocative and critical in its relation to christianity and church, it seems here there has been an effort to remain politically correct and to 'be ok' with everyone, specially with mid-stream america.	1
	except for the lone psychopatic killer, there are no bad guys in this story - church, masons, and even the cia, all are good and noble in their beliefs and intentions.	1
	there are no real revelations or criticism with regards to the somewhat mysterious masons.	1
	the most annoying part is the long ending of the book - after all the plot has been resolved, the good wins and the bad is punished, there comes a very long and boring part where the different characters priech to each other - and specially to the reader - with pseudo-mystical and pseudeo-scientifical arguments the importance of god and faith, the need to release our internal amazing capabilities, and so on and so forth.	1
	this again tries to be compelling both to mid-stream christian america as well as to new-age liberals.	1
	this part actually spoiled what could have been a reasonable reading and left me with a bitter after-taste.	1
	despite everything i still give the book 3 stars since in most part it still provides an interesting and suspensful reading.	1
	but it could have been much better.      	1
	more of a promo for the da vinci code.let me start by saying i am on the fence about dan brown.	1
	he has had some good books (angels,da vinci), and some not so good ones (digital fortress, deception point).	1
	so it was with some modest trepidation that i purchased the lost symbol wondering if i should have waited a bit longer for the paperback version to come out and save some money.	1
	after a somewhat quick 2 day read, i have come to the conclusion that i should have waited, or at least went to the local library and checked the book out for free.	1
	overall, it tells a somewhat interesting story, and even seems to make one or two good points in the end about humanity and the like.	1
	however, i could not help but feel that much of the book, like a previous reviewer stated, was more of an an attempt to make it 'movie-like' and fluff it up with all sorts of frivilous details that would have been better left out.	1
	in addition, scattered throughout the book were refrences to angels and da vinci code that had no actual purpose for advancing the plot of the story.	1
	it seemed like his follow-up work was more of a pitch of go back and read his previous two if you had not already done so.	1
	i was even shocked to see critical reviews for the da vinci code on the back cover and not reviews for the actual book i was about to read!!	1
	it seems to me that dan brown, possibly not of his own volition, but that of his publishers, has fallen into the role of a cookie-cutter story teller where he takes the same outline that worked for his previous two books and simply inserted a few new facts and locations to make this book sell.	1
	i feel that i did not experience anything new, but simply re-read an older story set in a new location.	1
	overall, i'd recommend folks to wait until the paperback comes out and save a few bucks, or even better yet, check it out at the library for free.            	1
	da vinci code remains brown's best.this book is 509 pages.	1
	for me, it got interesting around page 492. that's when the tease made on noetics and the global consciousness project in the beginning of the book was fulfilled...somewhat.	1
	okay, in the interest of full disclosure - i'm not a dan brown fan.	1
	i think the da vinci code remains his best.	1
	i hated 'angels and demons' primarily because of the implausibility of parts of the story (i.e.	1
	a tarp held at the corners serving as a parachute....c'mon!...and don't *even get me started on antimatter).	1
	he did not commit any such obvious errors with the laws of physics in this book.	1
	but, he didn't develop his villain until chapter 57 starting on page 221. up until then, he had the air of a badly drawn cartoon character.	1
	but his worst crime occurs at the opening of chapter 94 on page 351, an extremely implausible plot twist (which i won't reveal here) without which the entire rest of the story couldn't have taken place.	1
	so, from page 351 on, i find myself saying, 'no way...that couldn't have happened without [the events of page 351] happening...sheesh!'	1
	but like i said, brown made good on his early tease.	1
	and as i closed the book i realized that dan brown is a deeply flawed writer with a great nose for suspense, who finds himself on a deep spiritual quest, working his realizations into his novels; a writer whose realizations are uncannily in step with the zeitgeist of our culture and times.	1
	in the da vinci code, he made people question the history of christianity.	1
	in the pages of the lost symbol after page 492, he will make people question their own nature as well as that which they call 'god.'	1
	for obvious reasons, i was happy to see him give a nod to the gnostics...but perhaps my biggest criticism is in comparison to the da vinci code.	1
	in the da vinci code, he used the vehicle of the story to further his theme about the history of christianity.	1
	in the lost symbol, you had a suspense story which dealt heavily with the history and symbolism of the masons but which seemed, to me, largely divorced from the points he discusses from page 492 on.	1
	so, while there was a cohesiveness between story and theme in the da vinci code, that cohesiveness is lacking in the lost symbol.	1
	these opinions are wholly and strictly my own.	1
	i'm fully aware that most people will just love the story right up to page 492, after which most will say, 'what is that all about???	1
	good book, but i don't know about that ending.'	1
	your mileage may vary.	1
	happy reading!      	1
	decent thriller with dissapointing end (like dc).i liked a&d; the most, followed by dc and the lost symbol.	1
	dan brown builds huge suspense and dramatizes almost every chapter.	1
	he mixes clever dialog and suspense with facts and real surroundings.	1
	however in almost every case the end result is the same - none of those clever dialogs and suspenseful events lead to any tangible or significant result.	1
	it was hard to put dc down but lost symbol didn't have as much substance or thrill.	1
	for both dc and lost symbol when i was done i had the same question - notwithstanding thrills along the way, why did i spend so much time on this?         	1
	a let down.my first exposure to dan brown was in 'the da vinci code' which i loved.	1
	that was a fun book with puzzles (which you might even have a fighting chance at times of solving) and while straining belief (there's no such thing as a professor of symbology), was fun in an indiana jones kind of way.	1
	then, i read 'angels and demons' which i thought was decidedly worse in terms of writing style and in terms of the amount of disbelief we have to suspend (antimatter bombs in this era---no!	1
	head of cern with a private jet--no!).	1
	but, i thought, 'that was an earlier book...'   sadly, this book shows that dan brown is not improving steadily as an author.	1
	i'm glad that i bought this on the kindle, so i'm only out $10, but it would have been better to have waited and read it from the library... in short, there are numerous problems.	1
	unlike many people, i don't mind the professor droning on with lectures about the small details of everything.	1
	i think that dan brown did manage to keep good pacing through most of the book.	1
	but, his characters seemed rather flat.	1
	the villain lacked complexity or greatness.	1
	the ending (i won't spoil it) was a letdown and the whole 'bible code' issue seemed like a copout.	1
	then, there were the factual problems.	1
	i'm a physicist and the whole noetic science angle bugged me.	1
	the things taken as fact in the book hold no validity in the real world and i could not suspend disbelief.	1
	there seems to be a human desire to belief that in some mythical past, we knew much more than we know now and that things were so much better.	1
	but, there is no evidence that the ancients had knowledge of quantum mechanics, relativity, etc.	1
	we currently live in a relatively great time in human history.	1
	we've conquered many diseases and technology is allowing us to improve life.	1
	we've learned more about how this world works than the ancients ever did and we should acknowledge this.	1
	our ancestors worked hard to understand the world and did the best they could with the knowledge they had--they got some things right, but they got a lot more wrong.	1
	in the lost symbol, dan brown would have us believe otherwise, but this is not the case.      	1
	great for a powerpoint.it's not often that i get to the end of a book and think, 'really?	1
	why didn't i just give up somewhere around the middle part knowing, with disappointing accuracy, how the next half of the book will unfold?'	1
	i think i would like dan brown personally, if i were talking to him and not reading one of his books.	1
	he poses the occasional thought-provoking question, something insightful enough to distract you from the plod of the plot, diverting enough to get you through several more pages before the powerful suck of formulaic writing creates that now familiar sedative effect that i think i can predictably count on for any future creations about, what really should be, extremely engaging reading.	1
	the issue as i see it:  the redeeming value of mr. brown's 'the lost symbol' (and 'da vinci code') is that he pulls incredible factoids out of history, links them somehow to other amazing factoids, and creates a compelling thesis that makes you sit and think and want to know more about whatever historical object you thought you understood...truly interesting stuff.	1
	i give him major kudos for making me go 'hmmmm'; however, he really gets into trouble when adding a story that's used to present this interesting information to the reader.	1
	suddenly it's only mildly interesting, because you have to wade and struggle through dreck before you're surprised by one of these fabulous observations, and then you're back into the drudgery and waning interest before another bit of trivia startles you awake.	1
	i really wanted to like this book and i suspect that's why i kept reading until the end.	1
	ultimately though, i would have preferred a 30-page powerpoint with all of the interesting bits in bullet points and several hours of my life returned back to me.      	1
	pretty horrible.after 6 years of waiting, this book was a major disappointment.	1
	the historical information about the masons was of course interesting, but the plotting itself is unworthy.	1
	basically, the entire story is: robert langdon runs into a room, there's some long exposition where a supporting character teaches him something he didn't know, they run to another room where another character does the same.	1
	and on and on and on.	1
	plug in some lousy foreshadowing and a groan inducing 'big reveal' and you've just wasted hours.	1
	i recall liking brown's other work, but maybe 6 years ago i was more easily entertained.	1
	don't waste your time or money on this one.      	1
	hate to say it......i sure hate to have to say this....  i'll keep this short.	1
	this book was not at all what i would expect from dan brown.	1
	way too long.	1
	lots of rambling.	1
	i can't give anything away, but i can tell you that i would skip this book entirely.	1
	i'm going to pretend i never read it and go back and re-read angels & demons.	1
	; )      	1
	public pressure to repeat.dan brown is a writer of the first rank.	1
	moreover, he is an entertainer of the first rank.	1
	his novels engender emotion, stimulate thinking, and even elicit 'what are you talking about?'	1
	comments from the reader.	1
	i have always been suspicious of critiques, especially those from professional litarary critics.	1
	seldom do they enter the fray themselves, (publish their own novels) but are content to bash the work of others.	1
	(a good narrative of this philosophy can be found in sebastian faulks latest, a week in december.)	1
	all novels are not intended to be 'classic' in the sense of, shakespeare, '...now in our 400th year.'	1
	stageplays, of course, not novels for william.	1
	most novels are actually written to simply entertain, or get the reader to think, or perhaps to be a cathartic excercise for the author.	1
	still, i find that the lost symbol did not rise to the level of earlier work, but i recall some of the same feelings for tom clancy and i read each of his publications as well.	1
	not everyone hits it over the fence each time up to bat.	1
	good reading, driven plot (although i got tired of langdon finally realizing that 'it had been right in front of him' all the time.	1
	well done, dan.	1
	highly successful authors are allowed to hit a double once in awhile, (certainly john grisham has) and come right back to bat with a triple, or over another 'over the fence.'	1
	missed the mark.it is hard to follow 'the davinci code' and 'the lost symbol' falls well short of that high standard.	1
	this novel is set washington dc and explores the 'mysteries' of the masons.	1
	the main character is again robert langdon, the symbologist.	1
	mr. brown's writing is not at a very high level and when the thriller is thrilling this can be forgiven.	1
	this thriller is only passably thrilling (the last 20 pages are brutal).	1
	a good thriller begs you to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride.	1
	a mediocore (or bad) thriller has you predicting the outcome (successfully) and wondering what the hell these people are thinking.	1
	three strars may be generous.      	1
	better left unwritten.i bought this highly anticipated book returning robert langdon back on the scene of unsolved mysteries in famous places.	1
	the book starts out well enough, but as it progresses, most of the scenarios are so odd and don't do the characters justice.	1
	the book follows the usual formula.	1
	langdon, friend of langdon, a girl and the odd destructive character, all focused on a symbol that will give power to the world.	1
	that is all fine.	1
	but after the middle of the book, langdon starts to ramble about the mysteries of the masonic order and how they relate to the building of washington dc.	1
	these signs and symbols in relation to the capital, have been disproven already, many times.	1
	katherine, the woman compatriot of langdon, thinks her lab assistant is in the lab when it is blown up.	1
	her only comment afterwards is a gosh, i hope she made it out.	1
	never anywhere as the book continues, does she lament the loss of her good friend.	1
	i find that rather shallow for katherine who does everything with such passion.	1
	peter, katherine's brother, has his hand cut off and yet later in the book when he is found, he takes langdon on a trip to washington monument, as casually as if he has a cut finger.	1
	and when katherine finds langdon after this tour, robert langdon says that peter went to the hospital, as if losing a hand was an everyday occurrence.	1
	i think that brown was pushing it this time to tell the story.	1
	rambling dialogue, somewhat of a put down of the masons, and shallow conversation, don't make for a great book.	1
	i am glad that i read it so that i don't waste my time on any more of his books.	1
	he should have stopped with the da vinci code.      	1
	fun, but weaker than davinci or angels and demons.like his other two hits, dan brown fills this novel with numerous codes that must be broken.	1
	also like his other hits, this book is a page turner, especially the first half.	1
	but the second half of the book becomes somewhat tedious.	1
	the convenient interpretation of codes and low odds survival of main characters become less believable as the story unwinds.	1
	it's fun to read, but it's not nearly as exciting as his davinci code or angels and demons.        	1
	if you must read this, get it from public library.it took me many days of determined reading to get through this really dreadful book.	1
	i'm not sure why i spent money on this, it's not a mistake i will make on dan brown again.	1
	there was one aspect of the book that surprised me, but the rest i could have predicted completely.	1
	the thing that bugs me the most is that the publisher flooded the market with the book (a huge first run print) so that other books won't make #1 on the nyt bestseller list.	1
	i would have given it zero stars but amazon doesn't have that option.      	1
	entertaining, but much left to be desired.i've been waiting years for this book to come out.	1
	it was an entertaining read, but it was not worth the wait.	1
	enough reviewers have summarized the plot, so i won't do that here.	1
	suffice it to say, if you like dan brown and have enjoyed all of his novels - you will probably enjoy this one too.	1
	but if you're stuck on the da vinci code and consider it his best work to be surpassed, you will be sorely disappointed.	1
	to give you an idea of where i stand on the issue, deception point is my favorite novel by brown.	1
	the introduction of noetic science in this novel is very interesting, but the subject is treated very superficially and you get the sense that either the hard science wasn't there for him to elaborate on, or that he just got bored with it.	1
	he could have done so much more with it - i read hundreds of pages with bated breath to find out the exciting conclusions of these 'universe-altering' experiments, only to be met with (*****spoiler alert****) the measured weight of the human soul.	1
	this novel does not contain the level of controversy to be had in dvc and angels & demons.	1
	it does not make you think the same way those novels do.	1
	i found this to be disappointing, and i think the gap of the noetic science was the reason i was left wanting in this aspect.	1
	if you like the temptation of looking up pieces of art and architecture mentioned in his novels, you will enjoy his references.	1
	personally, i enjoy brown as an author because of the amount of research he puts into each book.	1
	i am giving him the benefit of the doubt in assuming the research was the reason why it took to long to come with this book.	1
	all in all, i would say this book was entertaining but lacking 'meat.'	1
	langdon has also become an annoying character with his condescending, know-it-all 'thoughts' written on every page.	1
	i agree with another reviewer that stated 'the ending sucked.'	1
	but i was sucked into the journey the entire time, unable to put the book down for extended periods of time.	1
	take it lightly for what it is, don't get caught up in comparisons, and just allow yourself to be entertained.       	1
	d plus for an a plus auther.i have a hard time criticing an author because i respect their abilities.	1
	i am a reader.	1
	so, from a reader's point of view this book was lousy.	1
	by the time i was three quarters of the way though i forced my self to keep reading because i spent the money.	1
	i would really like to have that money returned.	1
	the last few pages totally broke down into one or two sentences per paragraph just to cram in all the stuff that did not work for the story.	1
	no suspence, minamal character developement, no thrill,no di vinci code thats for certain.	1
	save your money!      	1
	same old.dan brown's new book, the lost symbol, spends 500 pages pointing toward the ending.	1
	it is indicated throughout that this ending will be more of a definitive conclusion.	1
	the last page loomed large, but 509 came and went, at best, with a whimper instead of a bang.	1
	granted the most difficult thing about this book would be the ending.	1
	well, it still is.	1
	what we have here is a fast read, if you omit the ridiculous italicized phrases and the fact or fiction aspects that flow throughout.	1
	the pages per chapter average less than 10, therefore creating frequent edge of the seat anticipation which only rarely occurs.	1
	and in a nutshell, this well publicized addition is no more than a change in location from his previous 'humdingers'.	1
	it is a mixed bag of tricks, a hash, but in this case a rehash.	1
	davinci and aliens offered something new, exciting and predictable.	1
	lost offers only washington d.c. and the predictability of his previous efforts.	1
	to me it was the same old, same old....perhaps an adult type of harry potter falling short.	1
	why 3 stars then.	1
	well, the anticipation was worth 1 or 2, the effort was worth 1 or 2, but the result...you can draw your own conclusions.      	1
	getting a little 'been there, done that' with dan brown in this one..well, this one will not put you to sleep, that's for sure, but it may become a bit predictable.	1
	i have read all the dan brown's books, and enjoyed the seldom-mentioned 'deception point' and 'digital fortress' very much.	1
	the robert langdon books have been enjoyable too, so far, in a fast-paced mystery kind of way.	1
	however, now that i am done with another less-then-24-hours chase around a major world capital, i am beginning to see some patterns emerge.	1
	every book contains stunning revelations which end up being very simple truths that leave the readers a bit let-down after the massive build-up.	1
	every book has crazy chases with a friendly, attractive woman who is smart and is a good partner for langdon but nothing ever comes of it.	1
	every book has a very streamlined chase only to be completely derailed at the end by the before-mentioned stunning revelation about the simple solution.	1
	it's a fun book to listen to, definitely raises some questions, and makes me wonder just how dan brown knows all these facts about the masons, d.c. buildings and other secret places.	1
	but i would probably get this one from the library if i were you.	1
	the lost review.although it took me a good 300 pages to say the book was great,  i did end up enjoying this novel.	1
	i do have to say that it was impossible to live up to the expectations of the da vinci code which i totally loved.	1
	as i read the book i also could not get away from envisioning tom hanks as robert langdon and few cast members from '24' or ctu on his trail.	1
	the plot was somewhat predictable for the first part of the book and did read somewhat like a screenplay,  however i did think there were some unexpected surprises during the last 200 pages of the book.	1
	there was much detail that would be fine to leave out and make the book shorter but for those of us who enjoy reading and want a great vacation book,  i thought this was a good read.      	1
	oh, c'mon!	1
	!.as many reviewers, i couldn't wait to seek my teeth into this book, especially after loving the divinci code.	1
	however, i have major problems with the book and beware, there are spoilers in this review.	1
	first off, as many have said, the book is way too long and very poorly edited.	1
	at the beginning, in robert's classroom scene, one of his students declares something to be 'awesome.'	1
	langdon rolls his eyes and wishes that the word could somehow be obliterated.	1
	then, several chapters later, as he is describing the pyramid, he actually says 'awesome power.'	1
	also, when katherine belives she is actually measuring the weight of a soul, was my biggest 'are you kidding me.'	1
	she 'proved' that before someone died, he was one weight, but then after death, he was just this much lighter, proving that she weighed a soul.	1
	well, i am no physician, scientist,but when you die, all of your body fluid is released--wouldn't that be the reason for the change in weight.	1
	that was ridiculous!	1
	as were many other things too numerous to name, although i was disappointed when katherine didn't use her power of noetic science to get herself out of the wire and leather that bound her.	1
	she also lost a lot of blood, but as soon as she was rescued, off she was bounding off to the next clue.	1
	and i don't know about you, but if i was placed in a sensory deprivation tank, even for a minute, i would not have my wits about me to travel through dc in the middle of the night to solve a puzzle.	1
	and langdon was in that chamber for quite some time, but he was able to do this.	1
	oh, and the---well, enough said.	1
	i could go on for pages.	1
	ah, maybe it's just me, but i'm done with dan brown.        	1
	great expectations dashed.....i had been looking forward to the release of this book for a long time and had high expectations.	1
	that was my first problem.	1
	my second was paying full price for this.	1
	i kept waiting for it to get better all the way through to the last page.	1
	by the end of the book i felt that i had been sitting in on a lecture that went on for too long.	1
	this story line had real potential but just never got off the ground.	1
	no real suspense, too much time describing location and movement and then no pay off at the end.	1
	i'm still not certain what the real story was here and actually kind of resent coming away feeling as though i have been made to pay for a religious indoctrination i was not interested in hearing.	1
	i hope he gets his mojo back because this book certainly doesn't display any of his earlier talent.	1
	seriously disappointing.      	1
	i expected more.i hate to give dan brown 3 stars, but this is not his best work by any means.	1
	too much of the story was weak and it did not tie together.	1
	it was like too many details were missing and he did not take the time to fully tell the story.	1
	maybe my expectations are just too high.	1
	i'm glad i read it and will read his next book, but it's  not in the same league as his other works.	1
	i just wanted more.        	1
	disappointed.i have and read all dan brown's previous books.	1
	i expected an interested and original plot in this last book.	1
	unfortunately the story was along the same lines as the da vinci code and/or angels and demons: just another story of another paternal secret society.	1
	the bbok was too long and repetitive.	1
	the plot was not really difficult to understand.if i knew i would have never bought the book.	1
	where's the challenge?.i'm a fan of dan brown's robert langdon series, but this one was disappointing.	1
	robert langdon didn't seem true to his character as defined in the first two books.	1
	in the previous books, robert proved the impossible, the improbable, the myth and the legend.	1
	in this book he seemed to be fighting the myth, repeatedly saying 'it isn't possible'.	1
	there were too many hints as to who the bad guy was too early in the book and the ending was way too predictable.	1
	after reading the book, i felt dan brown threw the story together without the effort it needed to be a great book.	1
	and i believe most are buying it based on his previous success (i know i did) hoping for an  entertaining story.	1
	this wasn't a good read for me.	1
	i hope the movie is better.      	1
	the ideal screenplay.i will start by saying that i did enjoy this book.	1
	it was a fast read, easy to follow, didn't jump too much between scenes, the characters were generally interesting and well-described.	1
	my disappointment lies in the feeling that this book was written with the primary purpose of being a novel-to-screenplay adaptation.	1
	the book has several chapters which seemed to stall, and then the last few chapters moved swiftly, as if it was a long moving trying to wrap before the two-hour mark.	1
	the story line is intriguing, and having visited our nation's capital just this summer, i already want to go back there again to see some of the details that brown describes in his story.i truly enjoy robert langdon as a lead character, but i would like to see some more recurring characters in brown's novels if he is planning to continue with the langdon series.	1
	for example, i am a clive cussler fan, and i can honestly say that one of my favorite characters of his is not dirk pitt, but instead the jovial st. julien perlmutter.	1
	his appearance in many of cussler's books is a welcome interruption in between the action and chase scenes that are so common to his story lines.	1
	i've read several of the other reviews here on amazon and it appears that many other folks share my feelings about this book.	1
	i would definitely recommend that it be read, but if you've never read brown's books (and no, watching the movies doesn't count!	1
	), start with angels & demons, then the da vinci code, then this book.	1
	you'll be able to better appreciate the character development of robert langdon as well as brown's writing style.	1
	enjoy!       	1
	he should have had someone else read it.dan brown certainly departed from writing gripping tales that keep you interested from beginning to end.	1
	this book was so predictable that half way through you knew what plot was about to unfold.	1
	the ending was so dissapointing that i re-read the final 10 chapters over again to see if i missed something.	1
	the only way my friends and i could describe this book was think mr rogers meets silence of the lambs in the worst possible sense.      	1
	dan brown's lost symbol.i have waited for the novel since he announced the title.	1
	i was looking forward to the thrill that dan brown always has provided until now.	1
	unfortunately, dan brown has settle himself to write a winded repetitive text that was more a history of the masons than a plot.	1
	i mention the plot becuase it is a cookie cut copy of both angels and demons and the da vinci code.	1
	his writing, on the other hand, provided a beautiful narrative that can be envied by most writers.	1
	dan brown, change the pattern plot, take risks and take your character to different levels.	1
	remember, he is no james bond.      	1
	a sad piece of writing.dan brown supposedly spent five years researching and writing this pitiful excuse for a story.	1
	the death of the lead character is inexcusable only to come back to life.	1
	our lady bleeds to death only to spring back to life without any medical assistance.	1
	the dead spots in the story about some past event that has no connection to the plot.	1
	perhaps i expected too much after the devinci code, but this sorry excuse for a story tears at dan browns credentials.	1
	save your money and don't buy this book!      	1
	why did i buy this book?.as i turned the last page - finally - all i could think was 'why did i buy this?'.	1
	we all know why; dan brown wrote the da vinci code.	1
	despite all the carping about brown's writing and the repeated denials of validity by those who care about such things, the theme was fascinating.	1
	sure, the book wandered around in church history, fighting off a very weird anti-protagonist, placing our hero in dire straits, and rescuing him.	1
	but, it was fun to read, fun to imagine if it were true, fun to talk about with others.	1
	the lost symbol has none of those 'fun' qualities.	1
	readers don't buy brown's books for aid in obtaining a doctorate; they're bought to enjoy reading.	1
	unfortunately, the lost symbol brings to the fore all of the lacunae in brown's writing skills without a payoff in the end.	1
	being preached at from the tallest spot in washington for what seemed to be endless pages was not what i expected or wanted.	1
	you know the drill - seemingly wicked cia official with the endless repetitions of her smoking, her size, her appearance, and her wickedness, admirable and intelligent hero but here there are two and one gets mangled for specious reasons, the last minute breakthroughs of langdon's decoding skills,the miraculous resurrection plus the wooden dialogue tucked between historical travelogues and biblical meanderings.	1
	masonic rituals?	1
	please.	1
	when langdon actually gives the 'bad guy' what he wants, my wanting to believe or be interested in the lost symbol died.	1
	no one with a brain much less this 'celebrated harvard symbologist' would have done this.	1
	no one with a brain would have kept saying or being told 'he promised he would let peter go' or 'he gave his word' and actually believing it.	1
	when the premise is super-knowledgeable and intelligent hero versus evil, if the hero isn't acting intelligently, the book dies.	1
	to have multiple heroes/heroines do this is inane; other reviewers have given the examples such as katherine's inviting the destroyer into the secret lab based on a faked text message.	1
	if that weren't bad enough, she'd already stated that the sender did not know how to text message.	1
	this book's page after page of the anti-hero's looking at himself and the descriptions of his tattooed body, descriptions of the inner tunnels and stairwells/stairs of washington's buildings, repeated descriptions of the fine qualities of peter's character, repeated digressions into mind over matter and the technology with which this is being 'tested', repeated biblical phrases and the nature of god - boring.	1
	i kept reading and waiting - turned out to be waiting for the book to end.    	1
	predictable and ultimately rather boring.if you've read the da vinci code, well... the lost symbol is just a superficial rehash of that story.	1
	the setting changes from paris and rome to washington, but we have the same pedestrian over-dramatic writing ('his blue eyes flashed'), sloppy editing, overuse of italics, a super-villain with inhuman strength and apparently unlimited resources plus an uncanny ability to outwit everyone around him, sinister plots in high places, masonry at the wheels of power in every institution, etc.	1
	it was all somewhat interesting and amusing the first time around, but now it's just predictable and boring and a little sad.	1
	if you have a kindle, download the sample chapter first, and i doubt that you'll want to actually buy the book by the time you finish that.	1
	if you don't have a kindle, wait a few months and buy it on the remainder tables.      	1
	typical dan brown.the lost symbol is a typical dan brown book, particularly a dan brown book about symbologist robert langdon.	1
	yes, it is formulaic ... but most authors do have a 'formula' they follow.	1
	is it *too* formulaic?	1
	... well, it's pretty close.	1
	the first 300 pages kept me hooked.	1
	i couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.	1
	but the final 200 pages were disappointing - different 'mood' to the book, dragged in many places, and i just about reached the point where my 'willing suspension of disbelief' was about to break.	1
	[and i wish i had the ability to 'read' emotions in a person's eyes as well as dan brown ... anger, violence, fear, anxiety ... all telegraphed solely in the eys.]	1
	as with his previous books, brown has created an interesting story integrating history, religion, science, art, architecture, etc etc.	1
	there was an interesting 'twist' along the way that i didn't see coming (and now i may re-read the book to see if i can 'catch' the twist earlier).	1
	overall, a pretty good book .... typical dan brown.      	1
	needs more.having read mr browns first two books and having thoroughly enjoyed the pace and the information presented, i find myself dissapointed by this third.	1
	it was slow in parts.	1
	this may be because i was looking for the same pace as the first two.	1
	this book spent alot of time explaining theories and not telling the story.	1
	i finished wanting to know more about what happened and why the characters made certain decisions.	1
	it felt incomplete.	1
	at times it was boring and i found myself wishing the character would stop teaching.	1
	the idea of god being in all of us is one i can accept, but it does not explain the events in this book.	1
	enjoyable but left me with questions not about theology but why the book went the way it did.      	1
	lost by the lost symbol.the book could have been 200 pages shorter and it still would only get 2 stars.	1
	i give it one star for mild suspense and the other star for using washington dc as the setting.	1
	overall i think the plot all over the place and had too many unneeded flashbacks.	1
	i know its fiction so i won't even discuss the unrealistic intelligence and security flaws that would never happen in dc.	1
	the so called climax did not occur until 50 pages before the end of the book and was over just a quick.	1
	i even noticed he took a comparison from digital fortress and brought it up again in the lost symbol which was totally irrlevant to this story.	1
	i guess he thought no one would notice since that book was written 11 years ago but since i just read digital fortress last month it stood out and in a bad way.	1
	at that point i felt like he was just writing this book to fullfill his contract.	1
	skip the lost symbol for now or atleast wait until its on paperback or in the bargin bin.      	1
	annoying but readable.did no one notice that dan brown has langdon carrying around about 200 pounds of stuff as if it were his lunch?	1
	there were so many beyond belief situations, none of which had to do with mystical anything.	1
	in almost every chapter dan expects us to buy some wildly improbably or downright impossible situation even as little as dc has cabs with separation between the driver and the passengers that magically allows the driver to hold conversations that the passengers can't hear, but at the same time not only can the the driver hear everything in the back but so can someone listing in on a cell phone place on the dash board.	1
	i mean this goes beyond physics.	1
	that said, and in spite of really bad pacing, there were moments i enjoyed, moments that made me tense, let's just say there were moments.	1
	but to enjoy them i had to really really push my suspension of disbelief to the limit.	1
	my advice: dan get rid of your editor.	1
	he or she totally sucked at the job.	1
	you should have been made aware of so many things like annoyingly redundant themes, long unnecessary passages, the fact that the book was really mediocre.	1
	i don't blame you dan, you were under a lot of pressure and with a great editor this could have been a really good book.	1
	i'm a best selling author myself and totally depend on my editors to make me shine.	1
	yours did not.      	1
	falls short of expectations.so what happens after you write two mega block busters?	1
	apparently, you leave all your good work on the table, and you write the lost symbol.	1
	i am a huge dan brown fan, and i have been awaiting his latest book of this trilogy for almost two years.	1
	i was first in line to pick a copy, and completely finished a mere 3 days.	1
	however, i was left with a very sour taste in my mouth.	1
	the book lacks the attraction of the da vinci code...which i could barely put down.	1
	the characters are not very likable, and the villain seems to be the same character as he has used before, strong, young, deranged killer... wow, that's earth shattering!	1
	mr. brown, if you read this review, i am very sorry.	1
	however, you have simply demonstrated how easy it is to reach the top, but how hard it is to remain.	1
	best of luck on the next novel.      	1
	sliding downhill without skis.this seems to be brown's strength.	1
	the novel starts strong, picks up speed and, alas, ends up in a slow, dull smarmy ending.	1
	preaching about the brotherhood of man is all well and good, but really...just after pages of an out and out twisted monster spattering gore and death over the streets of d.c. and how long will we have to endure the answerless questions?	1
	could it be there is a secret code embedded in the capitoline plat?	1
	naw, those streets were arranged for covering cannon fire in an age of bastions.	1
	and speaking of 'could it be's', seems the mysterious vatican has been abandoned for the mysterious masonic fraternity.	1
	what next: odd fellows, dervishes, phi beta kappa, aw come'on now!!	1
	an example of promise gon awry and our purchasing based on the past.      	1
	robert langdon becomes forrest gump.the book gets two stars for its intriguing and accurate history, at least about art around washington dc.	1
	no idea if what's contained that's stated to be for example from isaac newton really is.	1
	but washington as zeus is real, as are the other art references and i found looking those up to be fascinating.	1
	but the protagonist, which he almost isn't in this book, robert langdon, reminds me of forrest gump, though a lot less noble.	1
	he gets dragged through this book almost in a catatonic state.	1
	i had ongoing visions of professor forrest gump.	1
	yeah i know it's the tom hanks thing, but it fits.	1
	about 2/3 of the way through i wanted it to be over.	1
	unless there's some compelling reason to read this, you might want to pass.      	1
	same characters, different names, different city - boring.i was really looking forward to this book.	1
	the long delay due to all of the research dan brown was doing for the book raised my expectations.	1
	i feel cheated.	1
	granted his last two books angels and demons and the da vinci code are hard to follow behind, but i really expected more.	1
	about 2/3 through the book, i wanted to just throw in the towel, but i kept reading hoping that it would get better.	1
	it doesn't get better.	1
	save your money.	1
	if you must read it go to the library.	1
	no more dan brown for me, i'm going back to steve berry and james rollins.        	1
	just sad.a few interesting pieces of information, but other than that the writing was phoned in.	1
	i just can't figure out what took him all those years to write this book....must have been a lot of sleeping in there.      	1
	ugh.not very good in my opinion.	1
	i knew who the villian was 1/3 of the way through the book.	1
	the rather tramatic occurance somewhere in the third quarter; well, i just didn't fall for it.	1
	climax came too early, often felt like reading a textbook, some points repeated (and repeated).	1
	some interesting 'wow, i didn't know that' stuff, but you have to remember the facts are presented from one perspective.       	1
	i wont join in the gang-up (sort of).i made a reservation for this book with the expectation indeed that i wont get literature with a capital l. im counting not on good writing and fantastic insight but more on the extra mileage--yes it can prompt me to google and research more on some of the purported 'facts' used in the fiction in the end this really is something you finish very fast, more of a junk-food of a book.	1
	you won't expect going back to any sentence to savor any well-turned phrase.	1
	instead one should expect the clichs, and overused adjectives.	1
	dan brown repeated so many times 'staring right in the face,' 'so obvious,' 'it was so simple' too much in each revelation, it's a bit annoying.	1
	there's also 'starled,' 'stared in horror,' 'held his breath,' peppered in generously.	1
	to any reader, as an appeasement, i recommend you just credit everything to writing style.	1
	just plow long.	1
	dan brown anyway is now a confirmed master as of now of cliffhanger chapters.	1
	he makes it a point that you keep on reading--this is a credit.	1
	my primary problem in the book is in its building up to a very shallow prize (relative to the da vinci code).	1
	the last pages are almost a disappointment because of this.	1
	the ending made me ask... 'that's it?'	1
	to my mind, it's unbelievable for an organization to go to great lengths to hide in symbol something so not worth it.	1
	this makes the book weaker than the da vinci code.	1
	i wonder whether the author tried to avoid too much controversy in writing this one or this is really the conspiracy thing lined up for discussion.	1
	i think even the first national treasure movie (also regarding masons) one-upped the book in this regard.	1
	also as mentioned elsewhere, it's almost the same package, half of the book: the single assassin who had to be naked again, an intelligent lady partner with a personal stake, running from authorities, the running, and escaping so close, etcetera.	1
	im sure ron howard is now scratching his head, thinking about putting into film another book of the same exact flow.	1
	finally, was it worth my money and time nonetheless.	1
	i believe, yes.	1
	still good entertainment.	1
	and circumpunct is a funny word, i don't know why it sounds funny to me.	1
	circumpunct!	1
	say it out loud!	1
	makes me smile everytime.      	1
	a mixed bag of thoughts.i thought the book was fair.	1
	i think it took a while to get into the book.	1
	the first third of the book seemed slow and repetitive.	1
	there were too many unnecessary details.	1
	but if you like architectural history you would like it.	1
	the plots flow is much like the da vinci code.	1
	the overall plot was predictable but the suspense well kept.	1
	the book picked up pace and once the action began it was more interesting and enjoyable.	1
	there were many new ideas that i enjoyed and liked the more spiritual openness of the book.	1
	only a few charecters were well developed.	1
	i do commend dan brown for his great imagination.	1
	i just hope he diversifies into more different plot themes.	1
	preetham grandhiauthor of a circle of souls	1
	disapointing ending.while the premise seemed promising for about three-quarters of the book, there was no payoff in the end.	1
	brown seemed to go out of his way to not offend any group or religion.	1
	the last 50-75 pages seemed like research brown couldn't use any other way than a prof. langdon lecture.                               	1
	definitely lacking da vinci magic.i have read all 5 of dan brown's novels.	1
	here's how i would rank them: #1 da vinci code (great)#2 digital fortress (good)#3 angels & demons (average)#4 lost symbol (poor)#5 deception point (terrible) my biggest problem with the lost symbol is that i completely guessed the anticlimatic ending a quarter of the way into the book.	1
	the plot also requires supposedly intelligent characters to be unbelievably trusting and careless.	1
	there are a few interesting historical facts introduced throughout the book but certainly nothing close to those in da vinci code or angels & demons.        	1
	reads like a screenplay.i'm a fan of the author and looked forward to the long awaited release of his latest work.	1
	what a disappointment.	1
	mr. brown abandoned the reader in favor of hollywood with this one.	1
	i felt like the book was written in collaboration with  the film producers, not an editor.	1
	characters even seemed to be written with specific actors in mind.	1
	it was a long, drawn out read that can be condensed smoothly into under 2 hours.	1
	the good news is that it should translate to the screen better than the last two.       	1
	same ol plot, disappointing story.i dont want to give anything about the book away, but having read all of dan brown's books, i feel he sold this one short.	1
	6 years of hype really built this book up and instantly sent it to the number 1 spot on the new york times.	1
	but once people read it, the masses of reviews reveal that brown did way too much to make the book a history lesson with long drawn out spans of nothingness.	1
	having taken place in the capital of the us i was looking forward to many locations throughout the city and an interesting conspiracy about the capitol, but instead found nothing of the sort.	1
	i found myself force through the last 40 pages to ultimately be let down.	1
	dan brown's first 4 books were really interesting, but this time i found myself getting bored with the same style, which lead to some very predictable portions.	1
	i really felt let down by the book and feel this will lead to a poor movie.	1
	angels and demons was such a fantastic book and this has gone in a completely different direction.      	1
	same plot, different location.does it live up to all the hype?	1
	well, yes and no.	1
	the davinci code was a best seller because, fact or fiction, readers liked all the secrets and revelations contained in the plot.	1
	naturally, if dan brown wanted to replicate his original success, it was necessary for the lost symbol to use the same formula.	1
	this time, instead of focusing on the catholic church and mary magdalene, brown chose to direct his energies towards the freemasons, a veritable treasure trove of symbolism, myth and conspiracy theories.	1
	any-hoo, if you liked the davinci code, you may enjoy this read as well.	1
	but beware that much of the novelty of protagonist robert langdon's revelations have worn off.	1
	instead of riveting you to the page, this time around you may feel a bit tired of the lecturing harvard professor.      	1
	why do we expect so much?.this is an okay novel.	1
	it is a 'bestseller', not a work of literature.	1
	read it on a rainy day for the story (which unfortunately has all the weaknesses highlighted in other reviews), but read with low expectations.	1
	like watching a made-for-tv movie.	1
	i would guess that the movie will solve a lot of the weaknesses, maybe even improving the ending so it is not so obvious.	1
	borrow from the library or wait for paperback if you want more value. 	1
	way, way too formulaic and unbelievable.i really wanted to like this book, the lost symbol, because i enjoyed the first book of his i read, the da vinci code, and i also enjoyed the da vince code movie.	1
	i also read angels & demons and saw the movie, but i liked 'angels' less (i know he wrote angels before da vinci).	1
	i didn't even finish the lost symbol.	1
	the last few chapters were rambling filler and i just got bored to tears with it.	1
	all three brown novels have unbelievable aspects to them that are just unnecessary and take away from the story.	1
	for example, in angels, langdon jumps out of a helicopter and glides down to earth with the helicopter's sunscreen as a parachute(!	1
	)....talk about 'jumping the shark'.	1
	note in the movie this was changed.	1
	in the lost symbol, brown 'jumped the shark' when the character peter solomon, rescued after having had his hand chopped off and then tortured to reveal 'secrets', nonchalantly chatters away about the masons without a second thought about his trauma.	1
	the only reference to his injuries is a suggestion that he should probably go to the hospital at some point.	1
	well, yeah, maybe so.	1
	i suppose i'll see the movie when it comes out, as it surely will, but it'll take a very good screenwriter to make a decent movie out of the book.      	1
	too long coming and just too long.oh, where to begin?	1
	pseudo-science, god, fanaticism.	1
	sound familiar?	1
	it starts out promisingly enough but the scientific overload, hackneyed dialogue, ubiquitous sadistic/masochistic bad guy had me yelling 'enough, already' and wishing the denouement would arrive more quickly.	1
	it's not angels and demons, which i found to be a superior tale to the davinci code.	1
	what can i say?	1
	i was not a big fan.      	1
	loved angels & demons, enjoyed da vinci, hated lost symbol..listened to the unabridged audio book, and i found this book to be the worst of the three langdon adventures.	1
	there is no 'romance' to the adventure.	1
	in the previous books, langdon was in awe and in love with the discoveries.	1
	in this book, he is so skeptical, that even when the proof was right in front of him, after two adventures of biblical proportions, he still found it impossible to believe.	1
	also, the book was waaaaaaay too bloated and ridiculous.	1
	especially the end.	1
	after the threat is isolated, the epilogue is a further 6 or 7 chapters and endless psuedo-science blah.	1
	characters who should be seeking medical and psychiatric help are instead delivering lectures on the nature of god.	1
	very unrealistic.	1
	and a final point, the main villain is insanely 1 dimensional and cliche.	1
	dan brown borrows heavily from tom harris's francis dolarhyde character in red dragon, and is just as underdeveloped as the albino monk and the muslim assassin in the previous langdon books.  	1
	this book is a turkey!	1
	invest your money in a better read..a quick review of the last 10 books that i've read tells me that this is the worst of the bunch.	1
	dan brown sells out in order to keep his publisher happy and maintain their schedule for releasing a new book.	1
	i agree with many of the previous reviewers who point out the obvious, that dan brown just copied and pasted from 'the davinci code,' changed a few names & references, and published this book.	1
	much of the book was suspenseful and enjoyable to read, but i was surprised to find that there were also some really dull sections of the book that made me want to stop reading altogether.	1
	there are definitely several sections of the book where dan brown nearly repeats himself verbatim, particularly when referencing the histories of various religions and civilizations; this is dull to the point that i just started to skim over portions and not even read them.	1
	in addition, the final 10% of the book is an absolute boring waste of time; this was the most difficult portion of the book to read.	1
	i would recommend reading both 'angels & demons' and 'the davinci code,' but i would put this book more on par with dan brown's 'deception point;'  in fact, i would rate this book below 'deception point' because of the dull spots throughout 'the lost symbol.'	1
	what's frustrating is that dan brown clearly has the potential to write good books, but he sells himself short with this one.	1
	i fell for the notion that if this is the #1 selling book on amazon, then it must be good.	1
	my advice is don't make the same mistake that i did because there are many other well-written, enjoyable books out there.       	1
	tired of the same old brown.well, there is a plot, but this book is overwritten, boring because it has these long dialogues that go on and on.	1
	brown needs to come back to earth in his next novel.	1
	it is less creative than his previous novels.it feels more contrived.	1
	there are some good characters, but it's hard to imagine them as they are sloggingalong      	1
	so-so book.i agree with several of the people who recently reviewed this book.	1
	dan brown is not one of my favorite authors, but i gave this book a try.	1
	i don't know how anyone else felt about the last part of the book, but i thought i was back in my undergraduate days at the university.	1
	too much talk, too much philosophy for me.	1
	the climax came and yet the book when on endlessly about the 'mysteries.'	1
	glad i didn't actually buy this book.	1
	my husband is plugging away at it.	1
	bet he doesn't finish.      	1
	long wait and disappointment.this is not a bad story.	1
	it still provided me plenty entertainment.however, it can't compare to the da vinci code or the angels & demons.the previous two books blew my mind, from the beginning to the end.	1
	i couldn't put them down and couldn't wait to see what happened.for the lost symbol, there were some surprises and there were some cliches.i actually guessed some of the big plot surprises before the answers were out.i think dan brown can do better than that.	1
	maybe i love the previous two books too much.	1
	i think it would be really hard totop those two, or even just be as good.        	1
	not his best, not his worst.this is more of a sequel than previous works.	1
	the same symbolism used, the mysterious bad guy, and the lack of character development of all characters involved make me think that this was a novel not from the heart, but for a contract deadline.	1
	it's not a bad book, it's even enjoyable to some extent, but the fact that 'intricate' puzzles are solved in the exact same fashion multiple times and the fact that in the last third of the story the author clearly doesn't know how to end it, changing stancepoint on the center question of the story so often it becomes annoying and highly unbelievable, make it less than it could have been.	1
	mr brown clearly has done some research, but lacked the imagination to deliver a thrilling suspenseful and immersive story, and instead provided me merely an adeqaute one to read before falling asleep at night. 	1
	no surprises.as always, the story is fascinating and the history is what keeps everything moving.	1
	however, there are no surprises or 'twists' in the plot.	1
	i found it all rather predictable and the big scary 'threat to national security' was kind of a joke.	1
	if asked about the lost symbol, i'd say it is ok.  i would wait for the soft cover, though.	1
	on second thought, hold out for the mass market.      	1
	meh....good read.facts are ok, plot is good but not great, action is alittle on the slow side, the ending was also a meh, and the characters were good.	1
	however, the only thing that keeps this book from getting 1 star is the moments in the book that make you think, &#34;ooooh, that makes sence,&#34; or moments when you think, &#34;oooo, thats clever,&#34; or even, &#34;wait.....what??	1
	?&#34; this is probably dan browns worst novel yet, but if your a fan of him, juat hurry up and read it, purely for the sake of getting it over with.	1
	all in all, just go read it.	1
	:/      	1
	entertaining read.the lost symbol is like an action movie, if you don't think too hard about it, it takes you for a fun ride.	1
	the problem is when you start to look deeper, you realize dan brown doesn't necessarily know what he's writing (although his editor should have caught a lot of the details).	1
	i'm no symbolist, but his lack of attention to detail in 'real world' parts of the story is disappointing (especially since these don't add to the story).	1
	'my trace route got blocked, is that even possible?'	1
	- traceroutes typically get blocked at some point.	1
	'this ip has a funky format.	1
	it's written in a protocol that isn't even publicly available yet.'	1
	- then it's not an ip address, and the rest of the internet wouldn't know how to get to the ip.	1
	skids on a uh-60 blackhawk.	1
	blackhawks have wheels, not skids.	1
	i'm sure there are a lot more examples, but after the failed computer speak, i tried to just enjoy the story.      	1
	very tiresome.i was so excited to find this book at costco for around [...].	1
	the first day it came out.	1
	i settled down after lunch in my comfortable chair with a fresh cup of coffee and the book.	1
	a couple of hours later i realized that this book is just tiresome to wade through.	1
	i doubt i'll even finish it.	1
	maybe part of rating it one star is the disappointment i felt when i realized was just not a good book.	1
	it is much too long, i'm about half way through and am all impressed with dan brown's intelligence but not his ability to still write an great book.	1
	i think dan brown saw info on noetics and decided it would make a great part of a plot for a book.	1
	guess what, it didn't.	1
	i've enjoyed 3 of dan brown's other books but this one is a total dud.	1
	if you feel you must read it, check it out from the library or wait for the paperback.	1
	i'll bet in a week or so second hand book stores will have lots of the hardback.      	1
	not bad, but not so good.it was very predictable, and yes, the ending was very lame.	1
	i really hated the last third part of the book (right after the isolation chamber) and all the detailed explanaiton of everything............i better not comment on that.      	1
	the lost time.having read every book written by dan brown i was really looking forward to enjoying another exciting adventure with his characters.	1
	i'm sorry to have to say that this book did not deliver for me.	1
	other reviews in this venue touch on the same issues i would raise with respect to the cliche characters, etc.	1
	but for me, of greater import was my not being able to buy into the premise that was the basis for the whole 'national security crisis' string.	1
	while it was somewhat interesting to read about the masonic rituals portrayed as being part of a secret video that would cause chaos througout the world, i don't think most people would get all that upset.	1
	we have much more to be upset about these days perhaps.	1
	i'm disappointed with this one - sorry!      	1
	is it as good as the da vinci code?	1
	no..there has been so much hype about this book.	1
	amazon even devoted the entire main page to the book's much awaited release.	1
	extra security measures were taken in case someone tried to illegally obtain a copy.	1
	now that i read it, i'm sitting here thinking is that it?	1
	the da vinci code was excellent.	1
	i only read angels and demons recently.	1
	i thought it was fairly good, although i was disappointed when i realized how similiar the two novels were.	1
	if you've read angels and demons and the da vinci code, you will be able to guess who is behind all the mayhem.	1
	it was always the person you least expected.	1
	the lost symbol is a little different.	1
	the identity of the person creating the chaos in this book is so obvious, you would have to be a complete dunce not to guess it.	1
	another gripe i have about this book is why is robert langdon such a skeptic when it comes to religion and miracles.	1
	didn't he meet a descendant of jesus christ?	1
	doesn't he know where mary magdalen is buried.	1
	am i missing something here?	1
	the lost symbol had some entertaining moments.	1
	although, it all became a bit of a mess towards the end.	1
	the writing got just a little desperate.	1
	i think dan brown realized this.	1
	that may be the reason for the cliffhanger ending at the end of almost every chapter.	1
	i honestly cannot picture this book on the big screen.	1
	if it does happen, i don't think tom hanks will have anything to do with it.	1
	i don't know if dan brown is planning another book, but i get the feeling it's going to be all downhill from here folks.      	1
	similar to the dvc, well too similar..i loved dan brown's previous books.	1
	i loved the da vinci code and i loved angels and demons.	1
	i had high expectations from this book.	1
	i pre-ordered it so i could begin reading the day it was released.	1
	pros:the book begins nicely creating suspense about plot.	1
	i like the way dan brown makes you turn pages by scenes where the characters learn something which makes them go :o but he doesn't tell you that, yet.	1
	the writing is definitely good, no doubt about that.	1
	the use of existing places, monuments etc (just like dvc) adds a little more spice to the game.	1
	i like the way the chapters are organized, in few pages.	1
	but thats about it.	1
	by the time the real 'mysteries are revealed', i started to wonder if all of it was worth it.	1
	cons: the plot has some serious holes.	1
	i won't write the details to spoil someones 'fun'.	1
	but there are times when you go huh?!!!	1
	really?	1
	and why did...the ultimate mystery that was revealed, essentially the climax, i found, too obvious, too lame.	1
	when you build up all this suspense and all this excitement, the reader expects the climax to satisfy that excitement.	1
	when the veil is lifted, you expect something breathtaking, because you've been holding your breath.	1
	i didn't find that happening while reading this book.	1
	minor twists and turns are obvious at times.	1
	sometimes too obvious bearing unbelievable resemblance to the da vinci code.	1
	other thoughts: i was waiting for this book.	1
	i wanted to love it, but well, it was all too familiar and the climax was a big let down.	1
	i guess after the previous two stories were based in europe, he was compelled to write something happening within the country.	1
	the somewhat controversial story upsetting the belief of christians with the dvc, is being soothed with something enforcing its awesomeness.	1
	so i'm compelled to think, this isn't more of a follow up, its probably retelling a similar story with a few changes.	1
	i'd give it 3 stars coz 70% of it still made up for good reading.      	1
	let down after da vinci; angels & demons.i am an enormous fan of dv code and thought angels and demons was very good.	1
	read his others and thought ok; lost symbol was a big let down after he spent so many years getting this out.	1
	my advice, read it from your local library, wait for paperback, or read electronically....not worth buying hardcover--this was good but not great.	1
	ending was letdown as was most of the progression of the book.      	1
	just an average book.i read this book with an open mind, that was quickly bored.	1
	there were interesting and somewhat exciting moments but as a total this book seemed to be a weak copy of the earlier robert langdon books.	1
	the story was easy to predict and and some of the characters seemed to be a cliche.	1
	all in all this was a book that you can wait for the paperback to purchase.      	1
	mediocre.brown uses the same formula as in his previous books but somehow the tale is less compelling than his previous.	1
	a bit predictable particularly if you read his previous books.      	1
	not as good as the others.i had great hopes for this book even though i found the davinci code not as good as angels and demons.i was really disappointed in this book.i thought authors were supposed to get better from book to book i feel he is getting worse.the characters are boring other than langdon (who i love as usual) and you don't really care what happens to them i agree with another reviewer that katherine is an idiot to let this guy into her precious lab after receiving only a text message supposedly from her brother.the other two books had great villains that were the fronts for the real villain this one has a supposed bad villain who is just stupid and a zealot who is a front for no one he is just an idiot who wants power boring.i am sorry i had to rate the book this way i love angels and demons and this was just plain disappointing.if you like the other two by all means read this one but don't get your expectations too high      	1
	run of the mill.since the plot has been well-outlined by other reviewers, i'm just going to say what worked for me and what didn't.	1
	i enjoyed the da vinci code and also angels and demons, but i did not think they were masterpieces, just entertaining thrillers.	1
	'the lost symbol' sticks to the formula that has made dan brown a household name.	1
	the protagonist, harvard symbologist robert langdon finds himself in washington, d.c., desperately racing against time to save his mentor, peter solomon, who has been kidnapped.	1
	there is an antagonist in the form of the tattooed man, the mystically named mal'akh.	1
	there is a potential love interest, and a new branch of science 'noetics'.	1
	the action is well-paced, with a fair balance between action and dialogue, and it's easy reading, though at times i felt the writing could have done with better editing.	1
	in comparing 'the lost symbol' with the dvc and a&d;, i think it falls somewhere in between the two.	1
	part of why the dvc elicited so much debate was because of its controversial religious theme that was seen as heretical by religious groups.	1
	in 'the lost symbol', i did not find this great spark of controversy that is going to get people discussing this work as much as the dvc.	1
	the author's writing skills are pretty much the same as in his previous books, and i do not think there has been much maturing in this aspect (i.e.	1
	cardboard characters, tepid dialogue).	1
	final verdict - a fast-paced read, with plenty of action and some food for thought.	1
	fans of action and conspiracy thrillers will find this a good diversion, but i hardly think it's outstanding.     	1
	fun, but formulaic.the difficulty with this book is that of course it can't live up to the expectations that the da vinci code and angels and demons created.	1
	and while i tried to put those expectations aside, the lost symbol wouldn't let me forget them.	1
	while i appreciate the research that goes into his books, brown is now writing to a very distinct formula: 'the ticking time bomb' technique, those who know secrets won't reveal them; the uncertainty of who is good versus who is bad (and at some points in the book, the reader stops caring); the shocking twist that is revealed near the end.	1
	if i hadn't read anything else by brown, i would have enjoyed the book much more--but having read them, i can only say that i feel like i've already read the lost symbol, and the two other versions were better (especially since the 'shocking twist' is fairly obvious a couple hundred pages earlier).	1
	but it does earn 3 stars in my book, because weak dan brown is still better than a lot of the other popular fiction out there.	1
	if you're looking for a fun, fast-paced read, i recommend it.      	1
	another ripping yarn.	1
	'as the driver gunned the car up windsock drive...'  no-one 'drives' their car in dan brown's books.	1
	he loves these 'boys own' phrases and will not win any prizes for literature.	1
	he has however written another clever, ripping page-turner, with many chapters ending with 'as the door opened, they could not believe what met their eyes'.	1
	pure entertainment of which enid blyton would approve.	1
	the plot is sure to stimulate interest in the masons and washington d.c. tourist authorities should be  very pleased with the prospect of hordes of tourists following the trail of the 'lost symbol'.	1
	tom hanks is no doubt already practicing laps in the pool to get in shape for the movie.      	1
	another page turner, another thrilling ride.as usual dan brown takes us on a mythical, historical and a magical journey.	1
	from the first chapter to the last, i was glued to the story.	1
	the final outcome or the message of the story is believable, and encouraged me to do more research on the subject.	1
	now, there are lots of flashbacks.	1
	when i say 'a lot' ...i mean 'a lot'.	1
	almost all of the main characters past history are introduced as flashbacks and....i felt it was bit distracting or unnecessary.	1
	other than that, i have no complains.	1
	still, the da vinci code' is the number one for me.	1
	lost symbol can be put on #2 ...for now.	1
	also, the book has only 133 chapters :-) when you finish reading it, you will understand what i mean....      	1
	the last langdon (i hope).i read 'the lost symbol' out of curiosity about what dan brown would write about the washington, d. c. area and the masons, and to see what the storyline was this time.	1
	admittedly i had very low expectations, and they were fulfilled.	1
	*robert langdon has even less personality than before-his most important personal characteristics are his claustrophobia and wearing a mickey mouse watch.	1
	the other characters are brown's boilerplate cast with different names and nationalities.	1
	over-the-top villain described in disgusting detail.	1
	i like some relation to reality in my fiction-the villain's ability to disguise himself was too unbelievable.	1
	the wig camera is a hoot.	1
	*the 'omg' tone of the characters' thoughts, except where they are ponderous and self-righteous-bad, bad writing.	1
	*the whole book seemed pointless.	1
	it's never clear exactly what langdon's looking for.	1
	there's the lost word, and the map to the ancient mysteries, and the ancient mysteries themselves (which are theoretically not lost at all, if they're contained in the sacred books of the world's religions).	1
	no lost symbol.	1
	the villain already knew the location of the masonic pyramid.	1
	using the severed hand as a puzzle map for langdon is just another 'look how bad i am' moment.	1
	*the reader doesn't know what the cia is doing until very late in the storyline, and the cia wouldn't be involved in domestic matters anyway.	1
	again, no relation to reality.	1
	their real function was to provide someone for langdon to run away from, and provide the authority figure to be an enemy and then a grudging ally of langdon's.	1
	had to laugh at the line about a 'cia inquisition.'	1
	the big, bad cia, rather than the big, bad catholic church.	1
	*plot:  the crazed villain is going to tattoo the top of his head with the lost word, sacrifice himself to the dark side, get revenge on those who wronged him, and embarrass the masons, while preventing the rest of the world from having access to the ancient mysteries.	1
	he plays langdon and katherine solomon expertly; they comply with his requests with no verification (i brought the secret artifact that peter asked me to keep safe with me because someone i'd never heard of or spoken to before told me to?).	1
	the cia at least had a concrete objective, but their portrayal and behavior were ludicrous.	1
	*katherine's secret lab-ludicrous.	1
	peter solomon can dispose of smithsonian space to his relatives without formalities?	1
	katherine has no secure backup for her work?	1
	a carpet path through the dark?	1
	and peter solomon's personal space in the capitol?	1
	come on.	1
	*once the villain was disposed of, dan brown tried to find some point to it all.	1
	there was really nothing lost to be found, but langdon had to be convinced that all of the world's religions for thousands of years had hidden their common central theme from the unenlightened masses.	1
	for what and how?	1
	and now the masons can reveal it because of-katherine solomon's research?	1
	*again, it's fiction, but-katherine solomon, in an astonishingly short time, and with no apparent help except her mostly-unlamented computer tech and the odd volunteer, no peer review, no corroborative research-has proven the existence of the soul, the ability of humans to affect matter with their thoughts, and all sorts of other things, giving everyone access to the hidden ancient wisdom just as soon as she publishes.	1
	all the messy details of competing religions will be forgotten, and we can all become like gods due to our mental abilities, just as soon as this research is released.	1
	bushwa.	1
	*if you're at all familiar with washington, d. c., or even able to use the internet, there's nothing amazing about the descriptions of the capitol and other washington buildings, except perhaps brown's continuous attempts to find hidden esoterica.	1
	for example, the painting on the rotunda of the capitol is entirely understandable in terms of the 19th century view of george washington, with no need for convoluted interpretation.	1
	he was the father of our country, the exemplar of patriotism, civic duty, and virtue.	1
	many other readers have pointed out numerous errors in the physical descriptions and directions in the book.	1
	the one that stuck out to me:  the masonic temple (as it's known to local residents) in alexandria is not across the street from the king street metro station, and that's an easy check.	1
	if you're going to talk about real places, take the 30 seconds it would cost you to get it right.	1
	there was no overriding plot need to change the location.	1
	*nothing about the masons was in the least shocking or surprising.	1
	they filled the bill for a somewhat secretive, not well-understood group who could be connected to vague esoteric antecedents.	1
	instead of the illuminati and opus dei as bad guys, you have the masons as good guys.	1
	check out some of the masonic websites for their takes on brown's descriptions of their rituals and symbols.	1
	*the solomons are superhumans-no physical repercussions from serious blood loss or nonsurgical amputation-no shock, no pain-maybe i'll show up at the hospital after i convince this friend of mine that he can get hidden ancient knowledge out of this stone.	1
	all in all, just a badly written, silly, pointless book.	1
	a fast and fun read.i read this book over the weekend and while certainly not his best book, the book is a fast and fun read.	1
	without spoiling the plot i will say that mr. brown has continued his interest in symbology--this time focusing on the masons.	1
	he displays the ability to handle complex details with ease, and can make otherwise obscure information come alive.	1
	the way he weaves the different layers of plot while at the same time teaching you the information you need to understand the plot works well.	1
	if you liked his other books you will like the lost symbol.	1
	if you have never read a dan brown book, you can start with this one, but you would be better off starting with one of his earlier books--not that this one builds on his earler works, but because it would ease you into his writing style.	1
	all in all it was a great way to spend an otherwise dreary weekend.       	1
	poorly written and moronic.if dan brown was not dan brown there is no way this book would have been published.	1
	the writing was very poor the story was absurd and the ending was nonsense.	1
	a true waste of time.	1
	save yourself and pass on this turkey.      	1
	hate was too strong a word so i gave it two stars.	1
	'character a: have you heard of x?	1
	character b (usually langdon): yes, but i thought that was just a myth.	1
	character a shows or tells b something.	1
	character b reacts with shock.	1
	then, insert scenes of people walking from one place to another, being chased.	1
	then, insert the sentence 'suddenly everything made sense.'	1
	at least for the next ten pages.	1
	repeat. '	1
	i liked this analogy.	1
	one thing i would add though after 'character b reacts wtih shock' --character a smiles at everyone elses stupidity - as it's been under their nose the whole time and makes perfect sense to him/her.--add a crapload of preaching (i love religious books...i hate preaching books).	1
	you can do better dan brown....don't be thinking about the movie when you write the book...think about the book.	1
	eternally self rightous cocky characters grate on my nerves.	1
	if it wasn't a dan brown book...i wouldn't have finished it.      	1
	good but not great.i am a fan of the da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	this book tries to follow the same 'solve the puzzle' formula.overall the book is a good read, it moves well and there are twists and turns.	1
	however, although most of the book hints at a dramatic conclusion  similar  to the da vinci code, i found the conclusion to be not very dramatic.	1
	overall i  still enjoyed reading the book but  would not put it in the same class as the da vinci code.      	1
	don't bother.the da vinci code was insulting to the educated reader.	1
	this book is just plain insulting.	1
	apparently the american public can be easily duped into believing that masons are evil when, in fact, as dan brown makes sure we all know ad nauseam, the masons are godlike and the saviors of the free world.	1
	the book simply has a silly premise, bland characters, and mediocre prose.	1
	i can forgive the prose if i care about the story, but this story is just too silly.	1
	a female scientist sits in her top secret lab, so well protected only her assistant and her brother know how to get in.	1
	she gets a text message telling her to trust a complete stranger and let him into the lab, so she does.	1
	really?	1
	and that's just the beginning of a series of incredibly foolish actions taken by people who are supposed to be really smart.	1
	remind me to never trust the hero, langdon, with anything important - that exceedingly important box - the one that was generations old - the one peter trusted him to keep safe; well, apparently langdon had is kicking around his house ready to toss into a backpack based on the word of, oh yes, a complete stranger.          	1
	over hyped and under written.i was expecting a work of art, a museum piece like the 'the da vinci code', instead i purchased a drawing hanging from a refrigerator, also know as the 'the lost symbol'.	1
	after awaiting the arrival of this book with anticipation of a few nights of terrific entertainment i find myself sorely disappointed.there is not much that i can add that has not already been well hashed out in the other reviews other than save your money on this one.      	1
	waste of time and money.what a silly book!	1
	i like escapist reads as much as anyone, but this one was painful.	1
	i only continued reading it because my husband 'kind of' liked it & my daughter found it engaging.	1
	it engaged my gag reflex.      	1
	such a disappointment!!!	1
	!.i was really looking forward to this book.	1
	i pre-ordered it for my kindle and was so excited when i got up in the morning and it was waitiing for me.	1
	excited, that is, until i started reading it.	1
	about half way through the book i remember thinking 'okay!	1
	okay!	1
	i get it the masons helped found this country and yes they're a super secret organinzation...is that all you have?'	1
	i never felt any of the real suspense that i felt in brown's other books.	1
	the story didn't pull me in like some of his other books.	1
	overall i was profoundly disappointed with this book.	1
	d      	1
	don't waste your time or money.i couldn't wait to purchase dan brown's newest book, the lost symbol, because i really enjoyed reading the davinci code.	1
	wow, what a huge disappointment.	1
	the plot is silly, the writing mediocore and repeditive.	1
	i couldn't even bring myself to read the final pages - it was that bad.	1
	brown raised some christian eyebrows with the davinci code but he must have been trying to appease them with the lost symbol.	1
	if i want to be preached to i'll go to church.	1
	if you think you must read this book i suggest you should borrow it from the library, don't waste your money.       	1
	only thing i can say?	1
	garbage.it's not even worth wasting time typing a review explaining how bad this book is.	1
	i've never been a dan brown fan as his writing is mediocre at best, but lost symbol makes even mediocre sound good.	1
	stupid storyline, overblown writing style and an insipid quality very few books manage to achieve.	1
	all i can say is thank god i didn't buy this book as it was a gift, or i would have felt cheated to have wasted money on such a piece of garbage.      	1
	am i being punked?	1
	!.there must be a book in between the davinci code and the lost symbol that features robert langdon being a casualty of some catastrophic event that makes him suddenly stupid.	1
	you're world renowned specialist in symbology and the like and it's hard for you to believe some not that far fetched mason ideas (in the context of symbology) that are not really all that unbelievable and you can barely figure out each puzzle that is presented to you?	1
	how convenient of dan brown to not only write commercial breaks into the book, but to also put recaps every few pages of what happened the page before... just in case you didn't read it the first time...even though it was like a page and a half ago.	1
	dan brown might as well have just gone ahead and called bellamy morgan freedman.	1
	dan, you know that crazy mysterious obelisk... the one that you make seem so mystical to have here in the us when the origins are egyptian... you do know there's an actual egyptian obelisk in central park right?	1
	how many times does it take for the answer to be 'right in front of you' before you figure out that it might be a good idea to look right in front of you?	1
	and finally, the plot... thin and weak.	1
	the whole 'lost word' concept... weak!	1
	even if it was an actual word with actual mystical powers...	1
	on my--this is disappointing!.i've loved all of dan brown's books--except this one.	1
	ever so slowly, the story evolves requiring the reader to wade through copious lectures and discourses about freemasonry, historical symbols, religions, and other arcane subjects.	1
	brown's books are always filled with a myriad of detail and 'stuff'--but in the past, i found such passages absorbing as brown cites 'fictional fact' that comes across as non-fiction.	1
	in his latest book, the 'stuff' outweighs the story line as the book staggers to an ending by attempting to reinvigorate religious conviction.	1
	afterward, i found myself dog-tired as though i had sat through one of professor langdon's very long and very dry harvard lectures.	1
	come on dan, i've faith in you; try again.       	1
	lost symbol.lost symbol.....i was glad when i put this book down.	1
	i was relieved when ramblimg stupidity stopped.	1
	if this is made into a movie, perhaps they should try a cartoon format.	1
	richard franchi      	1
	the lost symbol.i thought the book was entertaining, although predictable.	1
	until i reached the end, that is.	1
	the end was a real let down for me.	1
	i think i would have enjoyed it more if there were some secret treasure at the end.	1
	the climax of the book did not fit the rest of the action leading up to it.	1
	i was dissapointed.      	1
	it's like clue meets groundhog day in a screenplay disguised as a manuscript..the lost symbol, sadly, is a perfect example of a book written specifically to be turned into a movie--one that would more aptly star bruce willis than tom hanks, i might add.	1
	while i'm sure the overabundance of explosions, hi-tech military equipment, and archetypal good guy/bad guy types exchanging uninspired, cliched dialogue will make the transformation from book to movie very simple, they don't make for a very good novel.	1
	the writing is only ever so-so and the seamless integration of plot, history, and theory that successfully powered angels and demons and the davinci code is gone.	1
	instead, the lengthy symbology explanations in the lost symbol are disruptive and often unnecessary, creating an unsettling and somewhat grating stop-start effect that constantly interrupts the story, slows the pace, and frustrates the reader.	1
	also missing is any cleverness or character development.	1
	although i was never fully able to determine if this book is just not as smart as some of brown's previous endeavors or if his formulaic writing leaves an imprint so predictable that readers are easily able to tap into its patterns, i found myself breaking codes and picking up on plot twists several chapters before the book's hero professor langdon, which detracted quite a bit from the overall believability of the premise.	1
	after three books, i also would like to see langdon's character a bit more evolved.	1
	for someone so stuck on patterns and consistencies, he seems fairly blind to his own: gets summoned to famed historical location usually heavily populated by tourists, finds obscure clue in the midst of mayhem, meets spunky, intelligent woman who becomes side kick, gets chased from one famous landmark to the other in pursuit of answers he claims he doesn't know, realizes he does know the answers, uses answers to prevent super bad guy(s) (usually motivated somehow by religious misconceptions)from changing the world for the worse, everybody lives happily ever after...until the next book, in which the exact same plot ensues.	1
	i don't seek a drastic a change.	1
	i just want langdon to acknowledge that he's been in this pickle before, demonstrate that he's learned something from it, and, for crying out loud, be a whole lot more guarded and a lot less trusting after after so many close calls.	1
	he always acts surprised at his own involvement and even more surprised at the epiphany that ultimately makes it all come together, allowing him to unveil the culprit.	1
	that works for the first novel, maybe even the second, but it's starting to seem like tired shtick by the third.	1
	it's like like clue meets groundhog day and at some point in the lost symbol--i predict around chapter 60--readers will realize they've already read this story.	1
	it just had a different title.	1
	from there, any sort of engagement in reading will almost certainly erode into a 200 page wait for the ending they already know is coming.        	1
	i fell asleep.i don't read dan brown for great literature.	1
	i read him for a good story and suspense, such as he provided in the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	both are lacking in the lost symbol.	1
	i soldiered on because i had paid for the book, but it says everything that 20 pages from the end i turned off the light and went to sleep.	1
	no page turning thriller here.	1
	a real disappointment.      	1
	great for a laugh on a long road trip.i listened to this book on cd.	1
	this book is so silly that it was great listen to on a road trip so that i could make fun of the bad writing and laugh my head off.	1
	when he starts preaching the gospel according to dan brown toward the end of the cd i just turned it off.	1
	i'm so glad that i had checked this out at the library and not spent money on it, otherwise i wouldn't think it was so funny.      	1
	a confused symbol of a lost writer..sadly, this book may mean that dan brown is a one trick pony.	1
	yes, it is his third major book, his third best seller but in all reality his first full novels angels and demons and the davinci code are but one book.	1
	angles and demons was the birth of an idea and the da vinci code the polished refinement of but one theme.	1
	so the lost symbol is arguably his true second main stream work and it is one riddled with weakness.	1
	robert langdon has become a shadow of the bright harvard educator we had glimpsed in his the former stories.	1
	in the moment of his most telling test mr. brown turns robert langdon into the weakest of protagonists and at the same time makes the man tempered in the fire of anti-matter and whose intelligence was tested under the highest levels of duress...  a fool.	1
	during mr. langdon's test of character he had control over his own fate and he failed himself and poor ms. solomon by giving away the very secret that would have saved them.	1
	iron willed silence it the face of his own death coupled to the wisdom that his silence would force his captor to save the life of the one man who could solve the riddle is what we expect from the brave and bright mr. langdon.	1
	instead we are introduced to a coward without intelligence.	1
	he is not the figure whose persona has been fired by the deeds from the other stories.	1
	this robert held the winning hand and folded under pressure while knowing his weak subjugation would surly lead to his death.	1
	in this fight or flight situation he could not flee, he decided not to fight and instead meekly surrendered his only weapon, 'silence' and his life.	1
	he did this under the same pressures he had already faced and overcame in italy, france and great britain...  so the question becomes who is this robert langdon and why does he lack the backbone he displayed in angels and demons or the davinci code.	1
	between this unrecognizable robert langdon and the other weak scenarios in this novel poor dan brown comes across as a lost novelist forced to fulfill his contracts with a story so poorly done that i'm sure he can not be proud of its writing.	1
	oh yes, if your foolish enough to buy and read this work reflect on this one thought...the story ends oh so many pages before the book does.	1
	you'll understand this if you read it...  dan brown tends to run on and on, long after the story is over!	1
	a book with three distinct parts, the good, the boring and the anticlimax.this book starts promisingly, with a apparently good plot, the mysteries of the  masonic brotherhood, the strange villain and the return of robert langdom.	1
	what seems to be a sensational story in the fist part becomes a hunt for a  jason-styled monster in the second part and abruptly changes diection to a third part where the hollywoodian-paced thriller is left aside and  the book begins the philosophical discussion^about who we are, to where we go, the meaning of life, the existence of god etc...it is a good book, really, well written, in dan brown style (i cannot criticize his stylre because the others also have formulas) but somerthing is missing here.	1
	a real finale, maybe, or maybe  something more solid instead of metaphisical theories...      	1
	nice try.even though 'the sequel' took some time before reaching the shelves, it seems that it has been written in a rush.	1
	the book is 'inflated' with unnecessary passages that seem lifted straight out of history textbooks, etc.	1
	a lot of repetitive elements too: i agree that solving puzzles in between action scenes was the main appeal of the ... code, but come on, do you really need to put 'it suddenly became crystal clear...' every 20 pages or so before having the main characters chased again?!	1
	it is also hard to believe that the good professor and co. solve some of the oldest riddles in human history at the speed of 5-6 minutes/puzzle only to fall into the next lame trap that anyone with a grain of common sense would have avoided even while multitasking.	1
	i will speak for myself (even though a lot critics seem to agree): i have never considered d. brown a good writer when it comes to his language usage, etc.	1
	but he always seemed to deliver a story so good that the unpolished writing style hardly ever mattered.	1
	not this time: the rush to complete the book is so apparent that at times it is insulting.	1
	in all truth, i suspect that it might not even be his (db) or his editor's fault: we all know that these days books like this one are 'blockbusters' and they are created primarily to generate revenue.	1
	this book should be read in this context or it will disappoint.	1
	when it is all said and done, i bought it myself, so who is the fool here?	1
	nevertheless, i find a book that tries to spark interest in visiting your own capital before heading off to cancun or paris first, reading the bible through 'modern' eyes, or entertaining the notion that science and religion both deal with the same subject from different perspectives a lot more enjoyable that most of the garbage that you find on bookstore (or electronic) shelves these days.	1
	read it and enjoy it, but keep in mind that by doing so you are making your contribution to converting writing/literature into the next 'special effects and no plot' money-generating industry.	1
	it's a little sad.      	1
	average read... and misleading.the book was ok.  i keep reading dan brown hoping he'll come up with another da vinci code, but the lost symbol was a disappointment.	1
	putting aside the light-weight story development for a moment, brown's take on freemasonry is whacked.	1
	his interpretations of our symbols, the assertion that the 33rd degree is the highest degree, and other 'facts' about the craft are just plain wrong.	1
	this isn't like the da vinci code in which the people who might have been able to prove or disprove brown's assertions were long dead.	1
	instead, brown could have spoken with one of millions of freemasons who would have helped portray the fraternity correctly.	1
	i should have know that the book was going to be a problem for me when the first thing i saw upon opening the book was a quote from 'the secret teachings of all ages.'	1
	as an amateur masonic scholar, i've read that book.	1
	i can tell you definitively that it falls short as an authoritative work on freemasonry.	1
	finally, i understand this is fiction.	1
	however, too many people will believe what is in this book.	1
	and although i give brown credit for making a point of the undeserved bad press the fraternity has received over the years, i wish he would have spent a little more time with actual masons in good standing. 	1
	anti climactic....i have to say i am a tentative fan of dan brown.	1
	i really enjoyed angels and demons, and the da vinci code was pretty good.	1
	i have to say that this book was beating the da vinci code until the last 50 pages.	1
	the ultimate resolution, or twist just seemed like a cop-out to me.	1
	like he was trying to think of something really clever and then gave up and explained it simply.	1
	up until then, it is suspenseful.	1
	the code breaking is fun and was i even able to figure small pieces out.	1
	one thing i thought was interesting about the book was how it dealt with freemasonry.	1
	i, like many thought this book was probably going to be anti-mason, but i was completely wrong.	1
	if anything i would say that the book had only positive things to say about the freemasons.	1
	in the interest of full disclosure, i am a freemason and i have to say he hit a few things in the craft right on and other things seemed to be a bit exaggerated, at least that is not the way we do things in my lodge.	1
	for obvious reasons i am not going to specify.	1
	but i will say that i do not think most freemasons will have any qualms with what brown put in the book.	1
	one final comment.	1
	it seems that in some ways this book was written to be turned into a screen play.	1
	the chapter breaks and shifting perspectives seem made for dramatic music and sudden cuts to black.	1
	i also think there is an overuse of flash backs which sometimes seem like tangents and pull you out of the suspenseful story you are supposed to be reading.        	1
	huge disappointment!.i love dan brown books!	1
	i've been waiting for this one for years and what did i get?!!	1
	a huge disappointment!	1
	come on!	1
	he is a very creative writer, he does tones of research before he starts writing and all he could think of a turkish prison from 'midnight express' and japanese director from 'the incredibles'!	1
	not to forget the abyss' of course... it's very lame!	1
	he should have put more thought in to this!	1
	also, he is global!	1
	his books have been selling for millions around the world... he should try and be more careful when making quotes regarding other cultures, countries and religions.	1
	dr.solomon does not even know how to use his new i-phone, he doesn't even know how to text message and his sister believes that he is really sending her a message!	1
	there are a lot of nonsense events in this book and i did not even finish reading it because it was so predictable.... you got the idea!	1
	while reading the first page i knew whatever he would be looking for would end up under the monument!       	1
	does not live up to hype.	1
	i read the whole book and was sorry i wasted my time.	1
	yes there are a lot of symbols and a 'big' mystery.	1
	the problem is (warning spoiler) after everything is finished in the end there is no 'word'.	1
	in fact the end is just nothing.	1
	no big revelation, no mystery solved just the revelation that all religions worship the same god.	1
	blah!	1
	if you read the 'da vinci code' and liked it, don't read this book.	1
	you will be severly disappointed.      	1
	disappointing.in a word: disappointing.	1
	in two words: very disappointing.	1
	the book feels contrived, totally implausible and the ending makes no sense at all.	1
	after reading it i could not help but ask myself for a few days afterwards: 'why did dan brown write this?'	1
	and 'was his editor on vacation?'	1
	not worth it.i have read all of dan brown's books,and enjoy most of them.	1
	the lost symbol is a lost cause.	1
	within the first 30 pages the telepgrpahing of the story was obvious, as were all major plot points.	1
	there is nothing new in the book.	1
	boring.	1
	don't buy it - if you must read it borrow from someone, get form the library, buy used on ebay....mr. brown called this one in.      	1
	skating a little close to saw x.i definitely love the crypto thrillers, but i am just hitting chapter 104 and this thing is starting to seem like torture porn.	1
	is drawn out torture and the threat of more the only way that the author can think to get the reader emotionally invested in our heroes?	1
	the book starts out with that shadow over it and seems to embrace it throughout.	1
	not liking this book at all.        	1
	enough already.i first read the davinci code and thought it was a decent beach reading book ala john grisham.	1
	after reading angels and demons and now the lost symbol, i found out they are all the same book with slight variations.	1
	the lost symbol was the poorest of the lot.	1
	i couldn't wait for chapters to end; fist because i thought i would get some questions answered and then just to move on.	1
	dan brown has obviously become a legend in his own mind.	1
	for the life of me i don't understand how anyone could give any book more than 2 stars.	1
	this one didn't rate that.	1
	like james patterson and robert ludlum, i will not waste my time reading another dan brown book.      	1
	i never thought i would complain about it.alright, i never thought i would be complaining about this book, especially once i was like 40 pages into or something, anyway, it became a huge letdown, the whole noetic science thing kind of blew for me, and the ending is huge letdown... dan brown shouldnt release a book unless its really good and this isnt      	1
	i get madder the more time goes on - spoilers.this truly is a work of fiction: 1) we know the setting is present-day, because there is constant mention of google and iphone - the redskins in the playoffs?!!!!?	1
	now that is a stretch.	1
	2) at the beginning of the book robert langdon flies from harvard to dulles airport - which is 30 miles west of washington dc - what kind of flight path did the private jet take that afforded him to see the washington monument from his window?	1
	oh that's right, that was only so dan brown could reveal the final destination of the book - which was completely obvious - i kept thinking to myself 'why couldn't a harvard professor put the pieces together when a simpleton like myself nailed it from the first few pages?'	1
	if he had just gone to there from the get-go, we could have avoided the torturous 400+ pages in-between and gotten to the pitifully disappointing ending.	1
	now for more bad news: 1) the true identity of the antagonist is painfully obvious - why is he so personally committed to destroying peter solomon?	1
	it only takes a few moments of recollection to figure that one out.	1
	2) the 'data backup' 'twist' was also obvious, which left the explosion of the lab lackluster.	1
	anyone in the technology/data sector knows you always have an off-site backup - in fact, everyone who has lost data due to a hard drive crash would realize the importance of an off-site backup, or at least a thumb-drive.	1
	yawn.	1
	3) that the architect of the capital (forgot his name) was so compelled to protect the mason's 'secret', even at the cost of the life of his life-long friend peter made sense - but then as soon as he saw that video, he folded.	1
	that makes no sense.	1
	that 'damning evidence' was nothing compared to real-life blunders that politicians and world leaders commit.	1
	the once you realize what that 'secret' really is, you'd think 'this guy is a sucky friend - he would let me die for that!	1
	- he's not invited over for dinner ever again'.	1
	4) more on that 'secret' - it's only the most widely published book in the world - what's so secret about that?	1
	very disappointing.	1
	5) the 'rest' of the smithsonian collection (the other 98% of the collection not on display, according to the book) only has 1 idoit security guard?	1
	really?	1
	thieves - take note of that!	1
	6) they are taking the blue line!	1
	obviously not!	1
	come on, 30 pages were wasted on that obvious 'twist'.	1
	7) i know, robert langdon has claustrophobia - every situation in which langdon encounters trouble seems to involve him being caught in a tight corridor or box....  8) katherine solomon, supposedly a brilliant scientist, is actually more gullible than my 2-year old son.	1
	9) there's more... [new chapter, focused on a completely different book review].... but i have to catch up on my work since i wasted several hours reading this disappointing book.      	1
	good story, but disappointing woo propaganda.this story has great potential, and is enjoyable if one can ignore most of the absolute bu115h1t promotion going on throughout the book.	1
	the only salvation for this book is turning it into a movie, in which case most of the nonsense can be skipped in favor of telling the awesome story underneath.	1
	dan brown likes to put a statement of what is 'fact' in the front of his books, and most intelligent people have the ability to separate the fact from fiction, if research is carefully done.	1
	he was more careful in this one than in 'the da vinci code,' but there was one point on which his 'fact' statement failed: science.	1
	all of the science mentioned in the book is not true science.	1
	specifically, the noetic science, is not science at all.	1
	he apparently did not research adequately, or is just especially prone to woo.	1
	probably a third of this book appears to be a propaganda piece for things on the level of 'the secret.'	1
	please.	1
	nothing has been proven about the mind causing matter to physically materialize or change -- the closest thing we have come to that is the placebo effect.	1
	thinking 'good' thoughts won't cause nice orderly crystals in freezing water any more than 'bad' thoughts will cause chaotic crystals.	1
	i thought brown was setting these notions up to later shoot them down with a skeptical langdon.	1
	unfortunately, that is not the case, and it will take stellar reviews on the next book brown comes out with to get me to even consider purchasing it.	1
	pre-purchase is from now on out of the question.      	1
	disappointing work.	1
	seemed very forced and repititious..just read 'the lost symbol' by dan brown.	1
	major disappointment.	1
	he is repititious to no end, there is barely a plot, and it really reads like he's kissing up to the freemasons.	1
	terrible book.	1
	don't waste your time.	1
	no suspense, you know what is going on from the beginning, and you hope against hope there is more, but there isn't.	1
	this truly was a chore to read and based on his other novels you keep reading it hoping it gets better but it doesn't.	1
	the lost symbol itself is a letdown and the book truly reads like an apology to the freemasons for any issues he caused them in his previous works.	1
	this novel may have been better if it was half as long by removing the many, many repeated statements and definitions.	1
	it was a chore to read this book and we all expect better from dan brown,      	1
	so glad i borrowed this instead of paying for it.if i had bought this book as i previously planned, i would be demanding my money back.	1
	thankfully i have good friends that don't mind loaning me a book before they read it.	1
	i returned it with no comment.	1
	i will let my friend decide for himself that this book is awful.	1
	if i want to be preached to, i will go to church, not read a book that is supposed to be a thriller.	1
	i can give my entire opinion in one sentence.	1
	when it appears that robert langdon is dead, i was truly hoping he was gone for good so there can be no more books with him as the central character.	1
	die already, i don't even like you anymore.      	1
	could not wait to put it down!.i am a big fan of dan browns previous books but with the lost symbol i could not decide whether to finish it fast and end the pain or just put it aside.national treasure the movie has this beat.      	1
	the lost dan brown.	1
	most of the previous reviews got it right: this book is not for readers, a rather pedestrian story, little plot, and i wish i had gotten the library copy.      	1
	disappointing, poorly-written book.after anticipating this novel for several years, i found myself bored with it almost immediately.	1
	between the neo-science terminology, choppy chapters, cartoon characters...it's all very mediocre.	1
	maybe because i have read daniel silva, carlos ruiz zafon, pd james, elizabeth george in the years since 'davinci code' and 'angels & demons', i find his work to be lacking in so many ways. 	1
	a huge disappointment.when i started this book, i wasn't expecting quality like michael connelly or dennis lehane provide, but i was hoping for more than brown gave us with this novel.	1
	the twist was unbelievably transparent, and really should be picked up by anyone who read the book that was paying any type of attention.	1
	the plot is a carbon copy of the previous brown books (both langdon and non-langdon related), where a supporting character is brought in to a dire situation in order to have the main character (langdon for this book) explain every detail that is happening in order to be able to communicate it to the readers, instead of writing it in such a way that the readers can figure it out themselves (or trusting that the readers are smart enough to do so).	1
	even if you can see beyond those issues, the plot is convoluted and the last act reminds me of 'the shack' by william young, not something you want from a supposed action-oriented novel.	1
	overall, it was a huge disappointment.        	1
	the lost symbol.initially i found the lost symbol to be an enjoyable, fast paced novel.	1
	i thought the subject was exciting.	1
	however toward the last third of the book i found it tedious...so much religious justification that it became a tired lecture on the commonality and unification of all religions.	1
	the discourse simply continued and continued...points driven in repeatedly until they became tired and repetitious.	1
	i believe the last third of the novel could be removed and it would be much more enjoyable.	1
	frankly i am convinced that very few readers will seriously read the last third with any depth of understanding...they'll slide their eyes over those pages looking for the end of the novel.	1
	i liked the lost symbol...glad i read it...but found it pedantic and boring a good measure of the time.       	1
	what happened here?	1
	?.the lost symbol is a huge disappointment.	1
	most people reading the book probably enjoyed the da vinci code & angels & demons, and the let down here with this book is tremendous.	1
	i am among the probably many readers who happened to love the dvc & a&d.	1
	;  the books were exhilarating - it felt as if i were dashing through the many sites in paris & rome with robert langdon, trying to decipher the mysteries.	1
	the pacing of those books were perfect, almost breathless, & both books made readers feel as if they were watching movies in their heads.	1
	which brings us to the lost symbol.	1
	at first, it felt like the national treasure movies with nicholas cage, but less interesting.	1
	the pace was missing in the book; it had none of the thrilling components of the previous two books featuring langdon.	1
	as other reviewers noted, there were tiresome patterns in the book (revelation, disbelief, revelation, more disbelief).	1
	robert langdon also seemed less of a mystery solver this time, & more of a straight foil.	1
	the symbols involved seemed overwrought.	1
	the end, where it tries to tie up the loose ends, lost steam, especially since the plot involved malakh was over.	1
	it was hard to maintain the interest to last through the final pages of the book.	1
	not sure exactly what went wrong, but if i had to list the major shortcomings, they would be lack of pacing, langdon's character being different from previous books, the symbols not being interesting enough, & a sense that the book was trying to incorporate too much (katherine's noetic science research had the potential to be interesting but did not figure prominently in the core of the book... so why was it even included or mentioned?).	1
	dan brown can certainly do better.	1
	someone said that this book was too much of the same, as in formulaic dan brown, but i think this one jumps out as being different, as in lacking that special ingredient found in the previous books.   	1
	new age quasi-religious masonic blather.after properly heaping abuse on christianity in 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code,' dan brown appears to offer an abject apology to christians in his new and very boring 'the lost symbol.'	1
	the symbol that is lost is the bible itself, the 'word,' with an eerie quasi-scientific 'noetics' new age bent.	1
	it's a long, long way to a very little house - this story.	1
	filled with inaccurate facts, populated with boring to mind-numbing characters, and a plot that goes nowhere very, very slowly, brown has created an unreadable and pitifully inadequate commercial product with his newest (and failed) endeavor, 'the lost symbol.'	1
	the so-called story line is borderline ridiculous.	1
	as bertrand russell once wrote, 'it has been said that man is a rational animal.	1
	all my life i have been searching for evidence which could support this.'	1
	unfortunately for the reader, russell's observation is oh-so-true here.	1
	all of the characters from the evil mal'akh, to peter solomon, to katherine solomon, to robert langdon and to cia director sato and other minor players are jokes, stick figures, irrational, uninteresting and totally unlikable.	1
	too many of the pages are filled with bizarre, violent, grisly and inhumane descriptions of people at their worst, while they abuse and terrorize others in the extreme.	1
	not one of the torture or abuse scenes was readable.	1
	brown uses the literary technique of dialogue to teach the reader arcane (and inaccurate) stuff, all of which is immensely boring and obtuse: architecture; masonic history; and washington, d.c. geography and architectural history.	1
	as a result, almost all the dialogue is unrealistic and mind-numbing.	1
	you will, as i did, scan and skip over most of it, in order to keep yourself from throwing the book to the floor in frustration and disgust, while trying to retain the thread of the story.	1
	there is way too much comic book style 'eek!'	1
	'egad!'	1
	'gosh!'	1
	'holy cow!'	1
	stuff.	1
	whenever you see that many exclamation points in a supposed literary text, you know the author is in trouble.	1
	and, the silent thoughts (in italics no less) of the characters are all - repeat all -- stupid or worse.	1
	this is not the worst book i have read in the past 5 years, but it's a close runner up to other publications i have endured to the end, but those were admittedly known to be trash to begin with.	1
	this new age nonsense rates only a 1.  dan brown, what on earth were you thinking of?	1
	your 'the lost symbol' is a joke.	1
	i forced myself to finish it only because i promised that i would loan it to my neighbor.	1
	he need not return it.	1
	it would be absurd if it weren't so boring.first off, i liked angels and demons and davinci code.	1
	i am not easily offended by 'goofy attacks on religious beliefs'.	1
	and, as a disclaimer, i must say that i read both of the above before they 'hit it big'.	1
	so i was free of all the hype.	1
	i wondered if all the hype would now taint me for the lost symbol.	1
	answer:the hype doesn't matter.	1
	this book shatters right through any pretense of excusing it for having 'too high of expectations' or having to 'live up to the da vinci code.'	1
	brown's writing has gotten much worse.	1
	either that, or he is trying to invent a new way of telling a story.	1
	you all know the plot, so i'll jump right in to my issues with the book.	1
	before i do, i will admit that i do think it could make a good movie.	1
	it needs work: a new ending, a good dialogue writer, actors who've never read the story, or can at least create their own interpretation of the cardboard mannequins in the book, and a half-dozen other major changes... okay, in no specific order: 1. sato.	1
	ridiculous.	1
	completely unbeleivable.	1
	laughable.	1
	every time she opens her mouth i questioned her credibility.	1
	no way a cia director acts like that, or is that inept.	1
	2. inner dialogue.	1
	dan brown needs to lose about 90% of it.	1
	3. cliffhangers / suspense.	1
	an author simply cannot show that a character discovers something, have everyone else see it, acted shocked by it, talk about it, but then not tell the reader what just happened.	1
	brown does this over and over again.	1
	if the pov character is in the dark, then it is okay for the reader to be in the dark.	1
	otherwise, it is annoying at best, but usually just a lame attempt to build suspense.	1
	4. shockers.	1
	the more you build them up, the better they need to be.	1
	and these were duds.	1
	and, they were built up to the max.	1
	astounding!	1
	incredible!	1
	langdon (and his tweed jacket) never could have imagined such a thing!	1
	it would rock the world!	1
	destroy nations!	1
	cause armageddon!	1
	ummmmm really?	1
	why?	1
	some dudes participate in rituals, so what?	1
	5. shockers part two - the big 'payoffs' in the revelation of the final location and of the character were both easily guessed hundreds of pages earlier.	1
	even if someone didnt figure it out, i can imagine them saying... so what?	1
	final comment - in the immortal words of that ancient philosopher of the mysteries, he who is known as spongebob squarepants ..... 'ummmm mr. brown?	1
	would you mind writing your books a little bit.....	1
	better?'	1
	what's the symbol for tedious?.when the dust jacket is the most artfully crafted element, there's a problem.	1
	true, creating a good work of fiction is not easy, but this novel really stinks.	1
	that said, i'm not going to blame dan brown exclusively.	1
	there was a cabal of co-conspirators responsible for this hot mess.	1
	1. heidi lange (dan's agent) - ms. lange, after the success of dvc, selling this had to be the biggest no-brainer of your career, even if the final product took six years to materialize.	1
	but since the lost symbol is now likely to send dan plummeting to the mid-list region (who'd of thought that was possible), i suggest you simply take the money and run.	1
	oh wait, you can't ... you'll want to stick around and be sure ron howard and akiva goldsman don't opt out.	1
	(they'll have their hands full making this film turn a profit.)	1
	2. jason kaufman (dan's editor) - jason, did you even read this thing?	1
	there are entire chapters that could have been nuked, superfluous povs, repetition on top of repetition, mindless banter, annoying forays into minutiae (for example, the origin of neckties), interior monologues or statements that do not adequately serve to break up extraneous exposition, a reveal that's more anticlimactic than any in the history of literature, and a protag whose role becomes as neutered as the villain.	1
	maybe chapter 44 is eerily accurate and like jason kaufman, uh, i mean, faukman, you didn't receive pages in enough time to properly review them.	1
	it could definitely take more than a few years to have fixed this manuscript.	1
	(i'd have thrown my hands in the air!)	1
	3. blythe brown (dan's wife) - this interesting woman does a lot of research for the hubby.	1
	and, girlfriend, i'm right with you on adding esoteric and arcane tidbits to spice up the story.	1
	(with degrees in linguistics, archaeology, and philosophy, that stuff is soooo up my street!)	1
	however, using every iota you uncovered bogs down the pace and results in serious nausea.	1
	listen to dan -- the book should be a roller coaster ride, not those freakin' teacups at disney.	1
	4. dan brown (our intrepid tour guide, but no george bernard shaw) - let's face it, dan, there was little to no chance this tale would outshine dvc, but kudos for tryin'.	1
	go on vacation, lick your wounds, regroup, spend time in an isolation tank, or hang like a bat, but don't pack it in yet.	1
	you still have fans and we know you're capable of better tales than this.	1
	(for those of you who don't know why i'm citing shaw, decode the back cover of the book.)	1
	so there it is -- dan was trying to please too many people with symbol.	1
	heidi's claims of easy money lured him and, even though he knew he couldn't top the sales of dvc, he felt obligated to his agent.	1
	then there was dan's special sense of obligation to his wife (whose ideas for dvc helped catapult his work into the stratosphere), but his misguided amour resulted in a hapless plot built to include (what seemed to be) every one of blythe's precious factoids.	1
	which leads us to jason, who should have had the brass ones necessary to whip out a blue pencil and save dan from himself.	1
	but as we all know, jason failed.	1
	and poor dan, shunned by countless catholics, laughed at by literary critics, and weighed down by his loyalty to the people listed above, was then expected to produce a flawless tome featuring some secret group and a dead president so as to, ironically, drive more dead presidents into the coffers of publishing and hollywood.	1
	the perfect storm?	1
	a recipe for disaster?	1
	a million cliches apply, but 'no pressure' seems most apt.	1
	like i said, there's plenty of blame to go around.	1
	(and if you want to read a less caustic but truly entertaining review, check out valannin's.	1
	it's clever and way too funny!)	1
	pure junk!.i've read better star trek novels..true!	1
	this is pure junk , a rip-off of the national treasure series, and made for the movies, not reading!	1
	don't waste your money!	1
	glad i only paid $4.05 as an ebook (also true!).	1
	if you have to read it because you bought it, be prepared to feel deceived.	1
	sorry, but either i'm getting too old or writers are selling their souls these days for the bucks.       	1
	this ain't no da vinci code!.i'm a huge fan of dvc, and have re-read it several times.	1
	however, this highly anticipated new book is boring, boring, boring.	1
	it took me almost a week to plough through it - whereas i read dvc in one sitting.	1
	the writers of 'national treasure' should sue brown for plagierism!	1
	anyway, the gruesome and violent torture scenes were over-the-top - just not necessary!	1
	i'm glad i borrowed it rather than spend $20 on this rubbish!	1
	i can't believe it took 6 years to write this book - i guess the author and publishers thought that this lengthy anticipation would fuel sales.	1
	hmmm.	1
	be warned though, we won't be fooled again!	1
	!        	1
	torture in print form.i was looking forward to  great read.what i got was a lot of historical mishmash and the actions of people who were supposedly highly intelligent.	1
	oh, my!	1
	what bumbling idiots.	1
	and the whole book is about 200 pages too long with all the mumbo jumbo and mystical meanderings.	1
	don't wast your time with this one.	1
	the movie will probably be better and at least, you can watch it without having to wade throough the mire of the book.	1
	gag.      	1
	poor!.i was looking forward to this new book, but i must confess i have rarely been this disappointed.	1
	this book is incredibly slow and overly complicated.	1
	it is like a flight that never takes off.	1
	it is not worth the money.	1
	there are thousands of other books that are signficiantly better.	1
	pardon me, but i do not understand the hype!      	1
	m. night shyamalan of the book world.this book 10 years ago would have been pretty good.	1
	da vinci code and angels and demons had a certain x-factor about them the same way the sixth sense did.	1
	they spoke to something that most people found very interesting.	1
	this book falls flat.	1
	it feels like a re-tread of his first two average works with nothing interesting thrown in.	1
	there were no original or often overlooked concepts that challenged your pre-conceived notions about anything.	1
	considering he took 4 years to write this and it came out after national treasure... well let me say i think most people, myself included, had higher hopes.	1
	maybe he had to re-tool it to be different than the movie national treasure and that lead to delay and some unbelievable plot resolutions?	1
	for me the set up just doesn't make any sense.	1
	why anyone would keep that particular secret so hidden, set up that many riddles, , under so many levels of intrigue with such elaborate codes, for that 'treasure' is beyond my ability to suspend belief while reading a fictional book.	1
	it just wasn't plausible for me.	1
	nor was the bad guy.	1
	it was predictable and impossible all at the same time.	1
	not only that, but i would guess most people knew where it was hidden almost from the get go.	1
	lastly, there was too much 'i'm an expert and i'm going to give a pointless monologue to show off how much i know [read: research the author did] about this topic...' to sum up: had this been dan browns first work it would show great potential.	1
	had it come out 10 years ago when some of these concepts weren't quite as main stream, and before freemasons became so popular it would have been intriguing and maybe original.	1
	in light of all that, and as his 5th book, an that most people reading it probably watched national treasure and have read other mason-lore books, and having taken 4 years to write it was a major let down.	1
	not a classic, but great storytelling.if you read the davinci code and if you enjoyed it, then you'll probably enjoy the lost symbol.	1
	it is not literature, but then how much of popular fiction is?	1
	dan brown is not a solid writer from a technical point of view, at least i don't believe he is, but then how many novels have i published?	1
	zilch!	1
	but i do recognize good storytelling and that is where dan brown's talent lies.	1
	even angel and demons was a great story, though i get bored with his anti-catholic point of view.	1
	that being said, the lost symbol is a great story.	1
	shifting from rome to washington d. c. robert langdon is on a quest to discover a hidden pyramid in the nation's capitol.	1
	the idea that there is a secret link to free masonry given that so many of our founders were themselves masons, is the bedrock on which the story is based.	1
	with apparent masonic symbols everywhere and with even the grid of the city forming masonic symbols you can see how much fodder dan brown has.	1
	this is not new material.	1
	there has been at least one program of the television exploring this idea (tlc or the history channel).	1
	like another reviewer i have a credibility problem with a harvard professor engaged in some of the stunts dr. langdon is called upon to undergo.	1
	i'm not sure i can continue to suspend believability that much.	1
	after a few chapters i also saw the similarity in the story to national treasure.	1
	i have to believe that this is a coincidence since all of browns recent books are stamped with a similar imprint.	1
	if anything, it is national treasure cashing in on the davinci code.	1
	the secret to brown's success in the lost symbol is the twisty, turny way he spins his tale.	1
	there's always something out there that is needed to solve the puzzle.	1
	if it's not a symbol on a building, it is a person who holds some information that is needed.	1
	these devices get old after a while, but they do string the reader along.	1
	eventually, you find yourself at the end of the story having followed the storyteller through the maze.	1
	the lost symbol is not classic literature but it is a good dose of modern storytelling.	1
	you could do worse in picking a book to read.	1
	i recommend.	1
	peace to all.	1
	so sad.well, i have to go along with many others here.	1
	this is a very sad follow up to a fine series.	1
	this book is so poorly written, it is painful.	1
	the plot devices are reruns of his prior novels.	1
	the 'science' is so twisted and unbelievable as to be laughable.	1
	it is so obvious that db wrote this under pressure just to write another langdon novel.	1
	there is zero orginality, total rehash of plot, and mindless idiocy of the protagonists that at one point i actually tossed the book across the room i was so frustrated.	1
	don't waste your time on this.	1
	if you want a good read, reread dvc.      	1
	poor.weak compared to other dan brown books.	1
	begins to improve in the last tenth of the book only to have a truly awful ending.	1
	disappointing despite low expectations.      	1
	ridiculous.one word is enough: ridiculous.	1
	it's a pity because the plot could be nice, even if kidding the reader is never a good idea.	1
	but there are so many faults that sum up in a very poor result.	1
	brown's problem is he is not umberto eco, so he can't invent books like foucault's pendulum or the name of the rose.	1
	read the fp if you want a real esoteric thriller.	1
	after so many pages of symbols, personal stories, different narration planes lost symbol ends with the bad one dead, the good ones alive (against all odds and kidding the reader again)and the meaning of the book totally vanished.	1
	i read it in english for the first time, and i must say that the italian translations did brown's writing a bad service.	1
	but the story is still non existing.	1
	much ado about nothing.forgive my poor english.....       	1
	howlingly awful.little did i know that dan brown would be able to actually write a worse book than digital fortress, but here it is.	1
	the main 'plot' is stupefyingly, indescribably idiotic and could be summarized in a single sentence; the rest are pointless asides and clunky, repetitive descriptions interspersed with flashbacks and 'stunning' revelations the reader sees coming from hundreds of miles (or pages) away.	1
	second worst book i've ever read; avoid at all cost.      	1
	the lost cause.i'm about halfway through the lost symbol.	1
	usually when i am at this point in reading a good book, i look forward to my next opportunity to continue the story.	1
	but that, unfortunately, is not the case with the lost symbol.	1
	in fact, i'm not sure that i am going to invest the time that it will take to finish this turkey.	1
	one of the first things that normally hook me into a good mystery/thriller novel is plausibility.	1
	if the plot elements are at least logical and possible, then i can immerse myself into the story and have a good time.	1
	but on this main point, the lost symbol falls flat.	1
	one of the first scenes in this novel takes place in the capitol, where a severed hand is discovered on the floor of the rotunda.	1
	logically, you might think that the capitol police would now consider the rotunda to be a crime scene, that they would block all the exits and call in forensics teams to gather evidence.	1
	well, you would be wrong.	1
	the sinister director of an internal cia investigative branch comes in, pulls rank on the capitol police and takes over all aspects of the investigation concerning the severed hand.	1
	that's in one of the set-up scenes of this novel, and that's where dan brown lost my interest.	1
	here's why.	1
	i worked for the federal government for 35 years, and i can tell you with certainty that the capitol police would never have allowed anyone from the cia to interfere in a crime scene in the capitol.	1
	and, the cia certainly has no rank to pull to get the capitol police to do anything.	1
	the cia is prohibited by law from conducting operations within the borders of the united states, and it certainly has no police powers within the capitol.	1
	that is common knowledge, and is certainly well known to the capitol police.	1
	if a cia director had tried something like a takeover of a capitol police investigation, every cia person involved would have been immediately arrested by the capitol police or the fbi.	1
	believe me, the capitol police are accustomed to dealing with powerful people and their powerful egos, because they do it every day.	1
	dan brown has used this cia takeover of the investigation as such a key element of his story that i just can't get past it.	1
	it makes the rest of the plot look completely ridiculous.	1
	this book makes me angry.	1
	angry that i wasted time and money on it, and angry because dan brown could have done so much better.	1
	i really enjoyed davinci, as well as angels.	1
	but, the lost symbol is a lost cause.	1
	ho-hum humanism.a famous princeton professor once received the following evaluation from a student whose father had clearly lectured him on the value of an ivy education:  'the lectures were boring, but long.'	1
	my academic friends make fun of me for reading dan brown, but, you know, i enjoy a good conspiracy yarn.	1
	and - although the stuff of angels and demons and the da vinci code is in my professional ballpark - i like seeing the material framed in a populist narrative, even if it's a bit abbreviated and gently twisted.	1
	news flash:  ironically - sadly?	1
	- my students are more receptive to brown than to elaine pagels as an authority for the mary v peter shaping of christianity, so there's actually a dan brown bonus in the humanities classroom.	1
	but this is a boring book.	1
	boring boring boring.	1
	it has all of brown's weaknesses and none of his strengths.	1
	there are the flat characters, the unlikely plotting, the absurd chronology, but there's no zippy secret agenda compelling the reader's attention.	1
	the didactic passages fall with a dull thud and the dialogue is gruesomely banal.	1
	tattoo man simply doesn't stack up against the roman church as a worthy opponent.	1
	washington dc is a poor third to paris and rome as a setting, nor does brown offer us anything to up the stakes.	1
	i liked sato and wanted to like katherine, but the whole solomon thing was just too cheesy for (even) escape reading.	1
	the material on noetics is mildly interesting, but badly presented, and the masonic stuff is sadly ho-hum.	1
	brown's strategies for down-loading info have not grown more graceful with time - nor, indeed, has his writing --  nor have his editors offered any amelioration.	1
	i anticipated it;  i ordered it;  i eagerly opened it.	1
	i have tossed it aside.	1
	save your money.	1
	for a book that heralds the apotheosis of the human intellect (well, of the male human intellect with a touch of star wars) this makes a decent paperweight.      	1
	the lost lunatic.i've read the da vinci code.	1
	it's brilliant, amazing plot and a great ending.	1
	but this book goes from 'ok' to 'really bad' in no time and is tedious to flip through.	1
	as a dan brown fan, i'd say this book is 'same old candy in a new wrapper' but leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth.	1
	sad.	1
	i knew it would be nearly impossible to top da vinci code, but this turned out to be the worst of his books.	1
	# spoilers ahead # the lost symbol is about a lunatic's dream to become god.	1
	this lunatic is really wealthy, has a loving family, all the comforts you could imagine.	1
	but he's a ... lunatic.	1
	lunatic loses his mind thanks to drugs, watches a documentary on freemasons, gets every mm of his body tattoed, becomes invincible thanks to tons of steroids which actually seem to make him superhuman, but wait, there's more... he wants to be god.	1
	so lunatic decides to go after  his family to get hold of the legendary pyramid, kills people, cuts hands of people, oh and kills birds, rats, rodents and performs all sorts of evil sacrifices.	1
	in the middle of all this melee, a group of people must protect the lost symbol, no wait.. it's the lost word... no, no, the lost mind, the lost language, oh wait.. it's actually a book = the bible !!!	1
	you got that right !	1
	and the cia has a job too... to prevent the lunatic from uploading a video to youtube or whatever.	1
	lunatic finally gets the pyramid and tells dad to kill him with a $1.6 million knife.. alas, knife breaks into two but lunatic has his wish fulfilled anyways.	1
	so you're thinking, what's the moral of the story..... easy, say no to drugs.	1
	don't get me wrong, this is a page turner... the first few hundred pages have exciting moments but as the story nears the end it becomes a drag.... and the biggest letdown is the secret that was being protected for which so many people had to die.	1
	turns out we can channel our mind to reach unimaginable potentials... and other philosophical mumbo jumbo.	1
	that's it, that's the secret.	1
	the secret, was a much better book than this.	1
	it actually tells you how to channel your mind properly.	1
	but this book is a waste of time.	1
	the climax made me want to tear apart my hair, but it's too precious a thing to lose.	1
	maybe if the secret was a hair growing cream, wouldn't that be something?      	1
	cartoon full of clichs.starting with the first few chapters i sensed that we were subjected to a formulated dan brown book.	1
	with all my goodwill i thought it was ok. it is kind of normal and expected from a novel to be formed using a best selling technique, which in fact in this case is the 'comic-book structure' with the intellectual main character, a well-educated, wealthy and powerful mason, his scientist sister and of course the mysterious villain chasing them in a historical city.	1
	the book proved to be a painfully boring read but i forced myself to go on until chapter 51. dan brown had copy-pasted his previous novels up to that point but using the turkish prison as a setting with the 'obese, alcoholic, spineless, sadistic prison administrator' clich???	1
	this character was exploited, actually sucked up to its bones over 30 years ago by a movie already!.so, i believe dan brown has googled 'best-sold clichs ever' and has come up with this caricatured warden.	1
	as a proud turkish woman i'm so bored of the mentioned movie and the prejudice that it caused, i didn't let this book which is full of circling repeats, tire my eyes anymore...      	1
	reads like a poor imitation by another author.as other reviewers have said, this is a repeat of brown's other books.	1
	i enjoyed the da vinci code and angels and demons so i made the mistake of pre-ordering this on my kindle so i could read it immediately on publication.	1
	i now wish i had put my money into a far better book - virtually any book would do - i ended up speed reading the final third of the book just to get it over with.the introduction of noetics i found particularly out of place - and it will only stimulate renewed interest in third ageism based on readers assuming that everything written here is true, like many did with the da vinci code.	1
	i hope that people will realise this is a work of fiction and not quote the ideas in here as absolute fact.if this had been published under another name, i would have assumed it was one of the plethora of derivatives which followed brown's other books.	1
	perhaps after the professional reviewers/critics are finished with it, he may wish he had used a pseudonym.        	1
	labyrinthically boring.boring... it's the less i can say about this book.	1
	i purchased the book on tuesday.	1
	i gave up on thursday.	1
	i couldn't finish it.	1
	i'll donate it to my local library.	1
	i'm not interested in what the secret is or what the symbol represents.	1
	one doesn't expect a literally masterpiece by dan brown.	1
	he declared that he gave up trying to write serious literature long time ago.	1
	but, come on, with all the money he has, he could have paid somebody to polish his style.	1
	most chapters have a flashback; the book is full of 'oh, my god' in italics; all the characters think in italics; and all 'important' information is in italics, each in a new line.	1
	i understand mr. brown doesn't want to bother his readers with such stuff as stream of consciousness, but the result was that each time i read something in italics i wanted to throw the book.	1
	he treats his readers as mental handicap persons.	1
	as for the plot, i don't expect a novel, something that for definition is fiction, to be accurate in all details.	1
	but, again, the absurdity of the story is just too much.	1
	even kafka would have found this book totally nonsense.	1
	the most exciting scenes are people staring at computer screens or at cell phones looking for information on the internet.	1
	i read somewhere that google is making people more stupid.	1
	i'll add: especially some novelists.	1
	of course, there are the required explosion, the murder, the murdered, the chasing, etc, all the stuff found in the average thriller, but this obsession to fix actual 'facts' in a story, just make it unbelievable.	1
	all the characters are cartoon-like, stereotypes.	1
	the villain, for example, is a eunuch!	1
	mr. brown seems to have a fascination with physical malformation and thinks that evil is attached with it.	1
	i wonder why novelists don't make their villains 'normal' clean-cut, wall street executives, who leave countries bankrupt.	1
	of course, the 'science' is all mumbo-jombo.	1
	the so called 'quantum effect' in our brains has been refuted by all respected scientists until exhaustion.	1
	read, for example, 'quantum gods'.	1
	only, oprah's fans, the ones that find 'the secret' inspiring will find that something important is said here.	1
	please, don't waste your money and your time reading this.	1
	maybe, the obligatory upcoming movie will make some sense of this spaghetti thriller.	1
	at least, tom hanks is a likable character. 	1
	the real disappointment!.when i purchased this work i had done so because i have read all of dan browns works and with the exception of 'deception point' enjoyed the writing and the character development.	1
	however when this very, large book hit my hot hands and i began to read i was devastated.	1
	first i bought the book while i am as i write this review in our nation's capital washington dc.	1
	i read the book in my hotel room 2 blocks from the white house.	1
	as i read the opening lines of the story the first glaring problem was the extravagant travel of langdon and the fact that he sees the washington monument as he flies into dc and lands at dulles international airport.	1
	now anyone who knows dc knows that the only way you will see the obelisk or the 'washington monument' is if you land at regan national airport in dc.	1
	if you land at dulles you see nothing but green pastures and a great view of virginia.	1
	the book goes downhill from there.	1
	i spent two days reading the book and to be honest by the middle of the work i wanted to pitch it.	1
	then i realized i would be better served to finish it and then return it to amazon because it was horrible.	1
	while i understand mr. browns fame his research and science is faulty and his character development deplorable.	1
	his antagonist is a tattooed version of his albino in angels and demons and the rest shall we say is history.	1
	i would suggest that if you want a good read, read any action fiction work other than this one.	1
	the lost symbol.starts offas anadventure and turns into a redundant lecture.	1
	you will hate the fact that you were drawn into this book by the authors reputation and a fast start only to be &#34;sucker punched&#34; with a rotten ending.      	1
	ending was a disappointment.let's be honest - we're not looking for great works of literature when we read dan brown novels.	1
	however, we do expect an engaging story with lots of interesting twists and surprises.	1
	i really enjoyed deception point and angels & demons, and i found the davinci code to be a bit of a letdown (mainly because it seems to be a novelized version of holy blood, holy grail; there is no question that it was the primary - and possibly only - source for the davinci code.)	1
	this novel reminds me of angels & demons; it gets off to a great start and it's very hard to put down.	1
	unfortunately, brown's novels are becoming a little too formulaic (you can easily guess 'who' mal'akh is well before its revealed) for my taste.	1
	i hope he does something entirely different with the next one.	1
	the other major negative, as a lot of other reviewers have pointed out, is that the ending is a huge disappointment.	1
	the novel does a terrific job of building up to something truly amazing, and at the end you kind of think, 'oh, that's it?'	1
	consider waiting for the movie....dan brown's long awaited novel 'the lost symbol' follows the dashing robert langdon through 12 hours in washington d.c..  why it takes 500 pages to describe the events of 12 hours remains a mystery, though, probably not the sort of mystery brown had in mind.	1
	brown's latest novel is formula driven.	1
	first, establish that langdon is fit and attractive - check.	1
	next, add a beautiful, intelligent, and possibly available woman to the story - check.	1
	ensure that langdon and his leading lady are crossed and double-crossed - check and check.	1
	it's all a bit tiresome.	1
	brown's books are known for surprises.	1
	i was 400 pages into this one before i was surprised, but at least there was (finally) a surprise.	1
	the book isn't bad, but i found it disappointing.	1
	that said, if you enjoy thrillers, give it a try.      	1
	bestsellers that disappoint.i just received my mfa in writing and literature, which some would say makes me a snob.	1
	ok, i'll take it.	1
	but in my own defense, i actually liked the davinci code a little.	1
	it was worth at least 3, maybe 3.5 stars.	1
	but the writing in this book is ridiculously lazy.	1
	there's nothing that captured me about it.	1
	i'm only giving it two stars for the ideas that drive the book.	1
	there, i think dan brown is awesome.	1
	writing-wise, come on.	1
	why are these the books that make bestsellers?      	1
	page turner, but in the end, it was mostly worthless calories.i enjoyed reading the book - it moved quickly and the story was interesting.	1
	but the writing was weak and often cliche.	1
	a good beach or airplane book, but not written well.	1
	get the book from a friend or the library if you want to read it.      	1
	no one really talks like that.....three stars means i liked it, which i am willing to admit.	1
	kind of like eating a twinkie, i feel a little guilty but enjoyed it nevertheless.	1
	i'll give brown two thumbs up for his research on freemasonry and symbology.	1
	for me, that was the best part of the book.	1
	the story was very similar to brown's earlier books, exciting but superficial.	1
	the dialogue was the most lacking part of the book, but then i wasn't really expecting much or reading for the dialogue.	1
	i'll consider this the last read of 'summer reading' and get back to work now... :)      	1
	easily his weakest book, but not a completely lost cause.i'm probably being overly generous giving this book three stars, but it did hold my attention and taught me a few things, and any book that can do that is not completely devoid of merit.	1
	that said, this is easily dan brown's weakest effort (and yes, i'm including deception point and digital fortress here).	1
	there are a number of problems.	1
	first and foremost, the 'mystery' just isn't that interesting.	1
	nor are the clues that are gradually discovered and unlocked.	1
	the masons may make for an informative wikipedia entry, but as a plot device, they just don't deliver.	1
	i found all the intrigue and history and secrets rather ho-hum.	1
	brown hits on far more exciting stuff in his earlier robert langdon novels.	1
	and speaking of r.l, the good professor is a problem here, too.	1
	he is by turns a genius and an imbecile, whatever works to advance or detour the plot.	1
	he suddenly remembers a lot of important details -- there are way too many eureka moments that seem disingenuous.	1
	oh, and the villian -- aka problem number three.	1
	is his backstory -- unveiled at the end but seriously predictable right from the start -- really supposed to be a twist?	1
	my dog could have figured that one out.	1
	and she's been dead for 12 years.	1
	i've got one last gripe, too.	1
	while i don't think brown's writing is as awful as others contend (it's not poetry, to be sure, but it (usually) doesn't make one cringe), he does have one annoying habit that ruins what could have been a few interesting twists.	1
	as they say in poker, he has tells.	1
	when a character is lying, or pretending to be someone else on the phone -- or when an event that is assumed to have happened in fact did not -- brown words the action, or dialogue, in a way that raises red flags.	1
	it's as if he wants to hint that something is not what it seems here, but isn't able to hint subtly enough.	1
	there is no doubt that this book as a whole is a phoned-in effort.	1
	but it's not the disaster some claim, and perhaps now that brown has put davinci code and the follow-up behind him, he can move on and create something that doesn't try quite so hard -- and delivers more.	1
	that's something i'd look forward to reading.      	1
	great, great book.this book blew me away.	1
	i've done a lot of reading, from milton and shakespeare to the vedas and the bible.	1
	i'm familiar with symbology and quite a few esoteric religions.	1
	being a screenwriter, i also know good writing from bad, and strong storytelling from weak.	1
	dan brown's latest book is stellar.	1
	the critics love to pick at his style, but frankly i don't think their comments are relevant.	1
	this book sucked me in and held me until the last word.	1
	the writing is compelling; the story is motivating; the mysticism is fascinating; and the puzzles are downright genius.	1
	way to go dan brown.	1
	keep 'em coming!      	1
	the lost symbol.as i sat down in the empty corner of my room, i picked up this book sometime saterday afternoon and closed it sunday.	1
	in the past i have read the other two robert langdon books and thought that this one went above and beyond.	1
	the book begins when robert langdon recives a call  from his old freind and a free mason peter solomon's butler, who tells him to go to the capitol building.	1
	when he goes into the room to have his meeting he finds it desserted, on his way out he finds something very framiliar, a hand, a hand of peter solomon...      	1
	e pluribus unum.symbologist robert langdon is once again called out on a mission, but this time it seems for an innocuous reason.	1
	of course, it can't be, or there would be no new novel.	1
	there is not much new here, other than the setting in dc and its monuments.	1
	langdon is plunged into a maelstrom of a hunt for a deranged, sadomasochistic villain who is close to learning the masonic secret of the universe and will probably use it for no good.	1
	because 'symbologism' is such an intellectual topic, every time a new clue pops up, it's necessary for langdon to run a mini seminar, which breaks into the action and the tension.	1
	as usual, his cohort on this wild chase is an attractive, brainy woman, but at least in this go-round, she's middle aged like langdon.	1
	if i hadn't already read da vinci and angels, i'd probably have enjoyed symbol more than i did.	1
	this book is better than most of the clones cranked out by others have been, langdon is a very engaging protagonist, and lots of the material he deals with is fascinating.	1
	for that reason, i was tempted to rate it 4 stars, but settled for three.	1
	but i do hope that brown breaks out of this mold next time around.      	1
	lost symbol.i had enjoyed dan brown's other two books di vinci sode and angels & demonds they both kept you turning the pages.	1
	the lost symbol has been a disappointment to me it is slow to get started and i find it fragmented.	1
	i bought it when it first came out and it is still not completly read.	1
	for me it doesn't hold my interest.	1
	i am 35% into it so hopefully it will get better.      	1
	interesting book quality purchase.this is a typical dan brown novel.	1
	i think he does well with his research and certainly keeps the adventure going.	1
	i think he ran the ending a little long and i had figured out the twist before i was halfway finished.	1
	i enjoy his books, but know that i am reading them for fun.	1
	there is certainly some information that i may further research out of interest, but again this won't become a 'classic'.       	1
	good but not as controversial as previous best sellers.i like it, sure i did.	1
	i still can discuss it for hours if someone can hold my conversation.	1
	but in the end i think it applies more to american (meaning usa focus community) rather than everyone.	1
	the davinci code and angel and demons were kind of 'i needed' to talk about.	1
	still, mr brown is shortening the time of their thrillers, from days (the davinci code) to a day (angels and demons) to hours (the lost symbol) through intelligent flash backs, congratulations!!!	1
	by the way it was my first experience on kindle for iphone, even though i miss the paper i think it improves my reading speed.	1
	congratulations amazon for massifying lecture habits!!	1
	!      	1
	not worth the time or money.i am an avid reading and couldn't wait for the next dan brown book.	1
	i even bought in hard cover which i do for very few authors.	1
	i wanted to love this book.	1
	i kept reading thinking it has to get better but it didn't.	1
	to say the lost symbol was a disappointment is an understatement.	1
	now to be fair some of the masonry information was interesting and quite accurate.	1
	but the endless descriptions of traveling from one place to another and the ridiculous way the police act including giving robert a ring from a crime scene just wasn't worth my time or money.	1
	the ending was just stupid and insulting to anyone who has the least bit of intellectual thought.	1
	if you have to read it defiantly wait for the paperback.      	1
	not a good introduction to dan brown.my 8 year old asked me what i wanted for christmas and i wasted no time in saying the lost symbol - i loved both the da vinci code and angel and demons movies(never read the books) and really looked forward to reading this book and introducing myself to dan brown's writing.	1
	the book gripped me in the begining - i fell asleep in the middle- and said wtf at the end.	1
	i think everyone before pointed out the obvious flaws in this novel but i am really trying to understand what in god's name i read and it took me a while because i have two young ones.	1
	i feel as though someone has played a bad joke on me and i got a dummy copy.	1
	this could not be the real book.	1
	yes it has a few twist and turns but why is the brilliant robert langdon so dumbed down in this book?	1
	he is supposed to be the hero yet i felt as thought every other character carried him along the over 500 pages.	1
	tom hanks will never reprise in role for this crap.	1
	and the never ending preaching..........the last few chapters after 'the big revelation' were torture to get through - was this part really necessary - it was like a bad sunday surmon.	1
	i am a life long catholic and have always questioned certain things in the bible but while reading this novel he had me wondering what exactly he was trying to prove or disprove - what was the point.	1
	i knew from looking at the dvc and a&d; that there were strong religious links but i think he went overboard with this one - the bible- 'the hidden word'- are you kidding me?	1
	i have to say that i did like mal'akh - he was the only interesting character in this book.	1
	he was so messed up you could not help but pitty him.	1
	another thing how was peter solomon able to go on a field trip with robert after being tortured and getting his hand chopped off..........did i miss something?	1
	i think my expectations were too high and now i'm sorely disappointed- but my kids will never know 8)      	1
	a let down....contains spoilers!!!!	1
	as someone who really enjoyed both the da vinci code and especially angels and demons i was initially very excited for this book to come out.	1
	however as i began reading it just wasn't holding my attention.	1
	this book spends a lot of time explaining historical background and there is not a lot of action, and when there is it seems drawn out and silly to a degree.	1
	there were several different points through out the book that i simply found myself bored.	1
	this is something that never happened in the other two robert langdon novels.	1
	another problem i have with this book is the presence of so many different sub-plots that don't do anything to advance the characters or major plots.	1
	the whole aspect of the tattoo guy being peter's son, i saw no real point to that.	1
	the presence of noetic science seemed to have no real link as well.	1
	in angels and demons the science was woven into the plot very well but in this one it kind of just makes an appearance every once in a while with no plot connections.	1
	i do have to say that the overall idea of the story is not a bad one.	1
	it was just not told in the best way.	1
	i did sort of like the characters of directer soto, and dean galloway, but the others seemed rather flat, even robert.	1
	i think a lot of dan brown fans will be a little disappointed with the lost symbol.	1
	i know i was.	1
	i hope his next one is more up to par with dc and a&d.	1
	;        	1
	excellent read!	1
	!.like many readers of dan brown, i had been anticipating his newest release for quite some time.	1
	one of the aspects of his writing that i have always enjoyed is the amount of research that goes into his novels.	1
	i love the imagery that he creates with his descriptions of people, places and events.	1
	as with angels & demons and the davinci code, i found myself wanting to be where he was writing about.	1
	the story itself grabbed hold of me and didn't let me go until the end.	1
	it had enough twists to keep me from putting the book down when i should.	1
	i always love an ending that i didn't see coming and dan brown masterfully did that in this book.	1
	it is a great book...worth reading 2 times at least.	1
	as i re-read it, i found more intricacies within the story that i had missed the first time, reading it as fast as i could.       	1
	june nolen author of in reverse time.much of this book is about the freemasons and how our country was planned and built by our founding fathers who were mostly freemasons.	1
	a secret order with secret meetings held behind closed doors.	1
	the entire book takes place within a twelve hour time period in washington d.c.in this book robert langdon was again helped by a woman, a scientist, this time named katherine.	1
	he is not an expert in everything and katherine is allowed to bring her expertise into the relationship.	1
	they do become close as they respect each others' fields.	1
	robert is at times a bumbling human like the rest of us.	1
	he has claustrophobia after falling down a well as a child.	1
	he isn't a super hero as betrayed in the movies made of dan brown's other books.yes, there are several chases and many long explanations of symbols, ancient history and rituals.	1
	that's what makes this story.	1
	it is the search for 'the hidden word'.as robert and katherine try desperately to save her brother's life by solving mysterious, puzzle clues they are watched closely by the cia.	1
	their journey takes them through washington's streets and into the bowels and heights of her most famous buildings and monuments.	1
	these insights in to places, we the public, will never see nor have probably  heard of, is exciting and mind-blowing to say the least.the  church is again involved along with a blind reverend.	1
	the many dimensions of the church are explored once more.	1
	many books of the bible, by chapter and verse, are spoken about and mulled over as they look for hidden meanings.there are many reviews and opinions about this book.	1
	i personally like the way dan brown writes.	1
	the twists and turns in this book kept me guessing and off balance, eager to turn to the next page.i bought the large  print copy because i plan to re-read this book many times as my eyes age along with the rest of me.	1
	i can't imagine the amount of research that went into this book.	1
	as a writer myself, i would love the chance to sit down and pick the brain of dan brown.	1
	this book is definitely a keeper!      	1
	well written, great start, boring ending ....this is pretty standard dan brown fare.	1
	the book is extremely well written in terms of style, sequence and content-arrangement.	1
	brown's background in formal academic writing comes through clearly.	1
	if you have read the usual fare of thrillers from the likes of clive cussler, james rollins, tom clancy et al, you'll definitely see that the writing style is definitely superior; no cheesy contemporary jokes or macho bs to make you groan.	1
	the downside seems to be that the book seems unnecessarily inflated with a lot of pointless chapters that add no value (perhaps to make it easier for the inevitable screenplay??).	1
	'the lost symbol' starts off reasonably strong and carries the plot well initially.	1
	however, two thirds of the way in, you start to guess as to the identity of the villain, but dismiss it as being too far-fatched.	1
	not so; like many of brown's earlier books, the ending seems a bit lame after all the initial build up.	1
	also, brown seems to be smitten by the freemasons; after about 200 pages of non-stop vindication of everything the masons may or may not have done that was perceived as evil (i was not aware that they were such a controversial bunch!	1
	), i was getting a little tired of hearing how the masons were all-knowing and seemed to have answers to all of life's questions!	1
	brown aslo seems to be under the impression that his readers are looking for existential answers and for the true meaning of god in his books.	1
	sadly this reader was just looking for a good thriller, nothing more.	1
	given my mild disappointment after all the hype, i can't rate this higher than 3 stars.      	1
	unabridged audio symbol.if you enjoy author dan brown's two previous robert langdon  novels (angeles & demons and the da vinci code), you will love this book.	1
	it is filled with those entertaining asides and historical information that his main character , our favorite symbolist,  seems to know so well.	1
	the amazing information as well as history asides are woven into this text, which sometimes  feels too heavy handedly.	1
	i am in love with the storytelling talents of paul micheal's narrative abilities.	1
	this is why the unabridged version is the novel is better to get than the abridged one.	1
	the abridgement is also by random house audio.	1
	one may assume that this unabridged seems overly padded.	1
	in this reviewer's opinion, i agree.	1
	however, micheal audio talents are a treat, so you can overlook the author's padding.	1
	it  takes a long time to get to the solution, so is the puzzle that this audio is worth it.	1
	i would say so.	1
	the end of the audio (and the novel) seems slightly overkill.	1
	also you can see some of the red herring so bad that they smell fishy before the listener gets involved.	1
	also the  brazen overkill that law enforcement/government agents  play in this story makes them this side of the keystone cops.	1
	part of the twist you can predict and see them , right before they hit you in the eyes.	1
	for those who seek a historical  adventure  thriller similar to national treasure or indiana jones film, this audio book is a good choice.	1
	this heavy handed work is slight overkill but is still entertaining.	1
	i still cannot wait until tom hanks does the film version of this book which is fast tracked for next year.	1
	bennet pomerantz audioworld      	1
	huge letdown.i liked , and i thought was a fantastic read...fun, great twists, cool story, nice little historical mystery deal.	1
	great.	1
	fast-paced with lots of cliff-hangers, which i totally dig.	1
	lost symbol has plenty of cliff-hangers, but this time the pay-off just isn't there.	1
	the bad guy kinda sucks, he's weird and that's good, but his big motivation is telegraphed way early on so his big reveal was kinda spoiled.	1
	also, the shocking revelation that would overturn the entire country?	1
	really?	1
	that's all you could come up with?	1
	bleh.	1
	then the big final mystery...i really felt cheated.	1
	that's it?!	1
	that's all there is?	1
	wow, what an amazing let down.	1
	and the epilogue was just a waste of 30 pages.	1
	everything about the book prior to that was good.	1
	but the ending was so deflating and uninteresting that it demolished everything that came before it.	1
	what a shame...i still like dan brown and robert langdon, but i hope they didn't just jump the shark on this one.	1
	solving the codes and stuff on the cover was more fun than reading the ending of this book.	1
	maybe if you only read the first 350 pages and let the ending be a mystery...that might be the best way to enjoy this one.	1
	one of the worst endings to a fun book that i have read in a long time.      	1
	langdon lost a step.i loved the previous two robert langdon novels.	1
	the hype surrounding this book probably contributed to a let down.	1
	the symbol was a good story, but far from the level of intrigue dan brown got us used to.	1
	the characters and plot seemed unfresh here.	1
	langdon didn't seem as interesting and there was altogether a lot of lecturing instead of the rich facts contributing to an effective imagination.	1
	i'd likely give this book better ratings if the expectations weren't set so high.	1
	that said, it's a decent read.      	1
	hey, it's fiction.it's always amusing to read how some people can take dan so serious.	1
	he's a fiction writer.	1
	problem is that in a world where logical thinking is not taught in school anymore, people really can't distinguish where dan takes a left.	1
	and another, and another.	1
	sure, he made a couple of back handed swipes at my personal beliefs, but much of his message is agreeable.	1
	but, on to the story.	1
	the characters were plausible for the most part.	1
	as usual some parts of the story just did not line up.	1
	the plot itself was kind of silly, but dan has a way of building up expectation so when the bomb is dropped you feel like it must be important.	1
	the bad guy always takes you by surprise, unless you understand how dan likes to twist the end by dangling it in front of you the whole time.	1
	the wrap-up of the story serves more as an apology to everyone he offended during the story.	1
	apology accepted.      	1
	give dan brown some credit.i've read the book and had no problem being sucked into the story.	1
	and he has a knack for giving us information through conflict.	1
	the teacher has to win over the students, the mentor has to convince the hero, etc.	1
	he also makes the novel feel important.	1
	for those reason, we should credit dan brown - he does a lot of things right.	1
	obviously - he's selling millions of books.	1
	i will probably read his next one.	1
	this one was a good way to break in my kindle - i knew i'd be able to read it no matter what screen it was on.	1
	but he does a few things wrong.	1
	at times he's so melodramatic, especially the bad guys thoughts.	1
	the characters are so black and white.	1
	he uses a similar twist (that i saw coming a mile away) that he used in angels and demons.	1
	his writing is full of redundancies that need to be cut.	1
	and for the love of god, stop the preaching.	1
	the final 10% of the book is completely unnecessary.	1
	that 50 plus pages of trying to convince langdon to be a bible follower because the bible is written in code - only langdon doesn't change his mind.	1
	it just ends.	1
	still, i enjoyed it and at times couldn't stop reading.	1
	it was fun.        	1
	a lost great novel buried in fluff and preaching..the first 300 pages should have been only 30, enough to set the scene.	1
	the other 270 pages were just fluff.	1
	the next 150 pages were very well done, exciting action, surprising revelations and creative twists, with a satisfying conclusion.	1
	and then there are 50 pages of new age preaching....reminded me of 'the celestine prophecy'. 	1
	kept my attention, but.i usually enjoy getting lost in dan brown's books, but this book, i felt, had way too much unnecessary information.	1
	sometimes it seemed to babble on & on & on.	1
	though it was a page turner for me, i really struggled towards the end.	1
	i was more excited about finishing the book then learning what happened; and even after finding out the ultimate end, it was extremely anti-climatic.	1
	dull.	1
	no expressions of 'no way!!!'	1
	or 'wow!'	1
	will i be purchasing other books written by brown in the future, yes.	1
	but this book is strike one for me.      	1
	extremely disappointing, even by brown's standards, a flop.i got this book a long time ago for my birthday.	1
	like others, i had read the da vinci code, and i found it interesting, really i did.	1
	it interested me in secret societies for a while and i think sparked a greater interest in symbolism, and intrigued with with the carefully tied concept, and the beautiful art, architecture, and scenery.	1
	then i read angels and demons, the prequel, and literally could not put it down.	1
	the plot was so pulse pounding, the theme was awesome, and the setting was great.	1
	that's not to say i didn't detect less than stellar quality in the writing itself.	1
	that's obvious.	1
	but i was happy.	1
	spoilers ahead!	1
	i waited patiently for 'the lost symbol' aka solomon's key and frowned at the delay.	1
	then i get it...and i was hit by trash.	1
	the first line by the villian 'i am a masterpiece' just made me hate him, and to be honest, the villian did not interest me or stimulate my imagination, he made me convulse in disgust and he made my imagination feel dirty.	1
	i mean ick.	1
	i really wanted him to die but he kept on going in his idiotic ramblings.	1
	langdon's lecturing tone was really bad here, an understandable problem but one that needs toning down.	1
	other charatcers also displayed encyclopedic dialogue that was uninteresting.	1
	the descriptions of noetic science were underwhelming in what was said with no big possibilities given.	1
	so a bunch of people could potentially move the tide, that sounds inefficient.	1
	so you made molecular crystal formations.	1
	big deal.	1
	some nerd may be excited somewhere but i yawn, and i am familiar with new age concepts, though i don't believe them.	1
	the first real substantial possibility suggested for the powers of noetic science and the abilities of the mind (aka psychic ability) is a reference to the power of faith healers.	1
	that's something significant, giving weight to the intangible power they believe in.	1
	but that comes on a page in the 300s, way too late.	1
	the architecture wasn't properly worked in, dan brown seems like he rushed, the end was idiotic.	1
	dan brown spends so long defending masons he takes no time to build them into something else, which he could.	1
	he got caught up in their 'no religion' policy.	1
	in fact he makes the masons, including the oh so incredible (sarcasm) peter solomon look like morons.	1
	this thing was so bad i had to skip a lot to get to the end, which i hardly ever do, and have never with brown.	1
	i am being very gracious in giving the thing shelf space but dan brown has forever lost me.	1
	i will never look at a book of his with a critical eye.	1
	dan brown: minus one trusting fan.	1
	don't buy this pile of garbage and give him more money.	1
	it's not worth it.       	1
	disappointment without reading.as a reader i truly loved angels and demons using my kindel text to speech.	1
	in saying this, i have wanted to have that same enjoyment with this novel.	1
	however, dan brown has decided not to allow this choice as of yet and that breaks my heart.	1
	which forces me to go onward to other authors such as stephen king.	1
	in my research this author has no issues how his novel is read as long as the public reads.	1
	great choice by stephen king!      	1
	formulaic and predictable but entertaining - 2 and a half stars.not a big surprise here - if you enjoyed the da vinci code and angels and demons, you'll probably enjoy the lost symbol, although brown's formulaic approach will likely tire on you by the third in the series.	1
	i'd rate da vinci code about a 4-star work, and angels and demons 3-star (like most i read tdvc before a&d;, so part of it's appeal was that brown's writing was new to me at that time).	1
	pros: like the first two in the series, brown feeds out information one bit at a time, with each answer leading to more questions.	1
	this leads to a very suspenseful, entertaining read.	1
	also like the first two, it's packed with puzzles that do appeal somewhat to my nerdy side.	1
	cons: repetitive, formulaic writing style grows old in this 3rd (and hopefully last) installment in the series.	1
	writing quality is about that of a b average high school student - i can't figure out for the life of me why brown's editors can't help him with this.	1
	the biggest con is the subpar character development - langdon isn't exactly the most exciting hero in the fiction world, and the supporting cast wasn't much better.	1
	the villian is a forgettable hodgepodge of bad-guy cliches.	1
	while the writing is suspenseful, i don't know if the lost symbol is more predictable than the last two installments or if i've just become accustomed to brown, but i found many of the 'surprise!'	1
	moments in tls to be more than a little predictable.	1
	overall - it's an entertaining read, but not great fiction by any stretch.	1
	if you enjoyed the first two, you might as well pick up a copy of tls, just don't expect to be blown away.	1
	bring it along on a long flight or something - it's more the type of forgettable entertainment best suited for a beach or airplane read.      	1
	predictable and disappointing.i've read all of dan brown's books and have no one but myself to blame.	1
	i first read angels and demons and enjoyed a good suspensful story; however, every book after and before (i don't know the order of publication) follows the exact same formula.	1
	the first time you meet the 'secret' villian when he is not described simply as the shadowy voice or figure (that is someone trusted and known to langdon or the main character) you always know that he will end up being the bad guy at the end of the story.	1
	dan brown is a lucky man to make a living writing, a very good living, for such predictable 'suspense thrillers'.	1
	this is of course just my opinion.      	1
	the money has gone to brown's head.i picked up the lost symbol the day after it was released, finished it two days later, and, well, it really was lack luster.	1
	sure there was some suspense, a twist here and there, but mainly it was a lot of fluff.	1
	it seems that with the success of brown's previous two novels--if you consider making poor movies a success anyway--he has completely given up on writing a novel.	1
	the entire set up of the lost symbol is nothing more than a screenplay dressed up as a novel, that's it.	1
	i'm sorry but when you have chapters that are less than two pages, you are not writing a book.	1
	the thing that makes it worse is the fact that we all know it's not his style; if you read any of his other books you actually see real chapters, with real descriptions, but in his latest book it is merely a hash up of what tom hanks will be doing in the movie.	1
	i'm sorry dan brown, but you were better at writing novels than you are writing screenplays.	1
	we do not need to know how every character moves from one place to the next in excruciating detail for the cameras.	1
	the other major drawback of this novel is the blatant use of product placement.	1
	every other page of the novel has someone pulling out an iphone or a blackberry and marveling at how amazing it is.	1
	sure it's kind of neat to know what various characters use, but we really only need to be told once.. after all we can all remember considering you mentioned it a mere 4 pages (or 5 chapters earlier ha).	1
	i will admit that one or two of the twists was actually pretty cool, but overall with the short chapters it was horribly easy to see what was coming.	1
	i really, really enjoyed angels & demons with it's critique of religion, but come on, did brown get coerced by the church or something?	1
	the lost symbol is almost a total reversal of his stance back then, instead of pointing out the idiocy of the church, brown now praises the bible and it's historical significance.	1
	not to mention the fact that the masons are not connected to any one faith, it's kind of silly for them to use the christian bible as a cornerstone of their secret empire.	1
	i was truly excited for this book, but like everyone else money has corrupted dan browns creativity.	1
	i seriously doubt i'll pick up another robert langdon novel again, if you think there won't be any, check out this quote from entertainment weekly: -'do you have a lot of ideas for future books?there is no shortage of secrets and adventures for robert langdon to take.	1
	i have ideas for about 12 books.	1
	i know i won't have time in my life to write them all.	1
	for a symbology professor, someone who understands iconography, ancient mysteries, there is no shortage of material for this character.'	1
	with his new short chapter style i'm sure he'll be able to pull another 4 or 5 books out of the air for more poor movies.      	1
	waste of time reading this book....this book was a complete let down not worth the time reading it.	1
	the story of malakh was predictable.	1
	some of the symbols were just forced.	1
	if you skipped a chapter and read the next you would not miss anything.	1
	the reference to history and symbols were not well connected like those in da vinci code.	1
	overall dont bother reading it instead go read da vinci code again.      	1
	this one fails the hype for me..i couldn't wait for this book and had it read within 1 week of its release.	1
	but, i guess i just didn't get it.	1
	first, it is time for new material - this one seems to do-over angels and demons and davinci code.	1
	same old same old.	1
	second, i kept plodding on, just knowing that the ending would be worth it, that the secret would be awesome.... but it wasn't.	1
	i don't want to refer to that secret here and spoil it for others, but i was let down and just thought - 'big deal'!	1
	i've read all of dan brown's books and loved them all, but this one just wasn't good for me.	1
	i'll wait for the next one and hope he picks up a different subject and comes back with something as great as angels and demons.      	1
	not worth it at all.	1
	dan brown's worst novels.yuk.	1
	what a disappointment.	1
	this is easily dan brown's worst novel.	1
	having read and loved da vinci code, i read all of brown's other novels.	1
	angels & demons was even better than da vinci code, and the other two were interesting, albeit not great.	1
	but this latest novel, the lost symbol, is just plain bad.	1
	did brown use up all his good material in prior novels, or was he pressured to make an untimely release?	1
	who knows, but it is undeniable that this book is a failure.	1
	it reminds me of an awful movie sequel, and comes across as some cheap copy-cat trying to imitate real art.	1
	ironic that brown is both the cheap copy-cat and the earlier artist.	1
	the various earth-shattering-if-discovered secrets are ultimately more boring and pedestrian than even the typical washington sex scandal.	1
	the mal'akh story was so painfully obvious that i felt insulted as i discovered it was really being set up as the climax.	1
	i kept thinking brown would surely come up with some strange twist, but he didn't; the novel just continued toward its inevitable, obvious, boring conclusion.	1
	but perhaps most annoying was the endless, irrelevant parade of gratuitous symbol discoveries.	1
	at least in da vinci code the symbols had some plausible reason and purpose in the plot.	1
	here, they were just an endless hodge-podge of meaningless signs and symbols.	1
	and the events leading to their discovery, let alone the discovered symbols themselves, were meaningless to the plot.	1
	this book was too forced, contrived, predictable, and just boring.	1
	by the last several chapters, i was so annoyed i just skimmed through it, and finally i couldn't even continue that ... i could not tolerate to waste another minute of my life.	1
	i respected dan brown far more before reading this book.	1
	if you're fortunate enough to have not yet read this book, do yourself a favor and skip this one.	1
	read his better novels, or something else, but do not read this.	1
	enjoyed it,but found it predictable.okay, i have to admit that on a cold, cloudy day, this book was a good escape.	1
	however, i also found that the plot was too easy to figure out...the evil bad guy?	1
	didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out his true identity halfway through the book.	1
	the demise of the main characters?	1
	come on,you knew this wasn't really the end for any of them (and did they check their brains at the door when they fell into the trap?)	1
	i did really enjoy the first 2/3 of this book-it had a good pace and interesting twists, but toward the end, i had to wonder, like others, where the editor was.	1
	i think the book could have been wrapped up rather nicely if it had edited down by about a 100 pages.      	1
	high school evaluation.the lost symbol by dan brown is an extraordinary read for young adults who are seeking thriller writing with a twisted plot.	1
	there are so many unexpected surprises and revelations within the characters that make this novel such a fantastic read.	1
	it is brown's best work yet that his fans will absolutely love!	1
	we enter the story witnessing an ancient ritual that a secret spy is undergoing in effort of learning the most vital secret that exists within the brotherhood, or the masonry.	1
	robert langdon, a harvard symbologist, is then requested to hold an evening lecture at the u.s. capitol building where he is forced to uncover ancient mysteries that few know of.	1
	he is immediately plunged into the world of masonic secrets and hidden history that will ultimately uncover the truth that so many have died protecting to keep secret.	1
	dan brown challenges his readers to a whole new intellectual level with his twisted plot development.	1
	he is the master of intertwining history with fiction; he makes us reevaluate what is real and what is not.	1
	his characterization also deserves applause.	1
	robert langdon is the character we know and love from brown's other novels.	1
	this claustrophobic, intelligent, and genuine character really makes the novel worthwhile - he's that important.	1
	the other characters also play major roles.	1
	their unique personalities show brown's range as a writer.	1
	moreover, the symbolism that he provides is a bit overwhelming but still enlightening once understood, hence the title of the novel.	1
	readers will find codes within codes within codes that reveal all sorts of fictitious truth.	1
	needless to say, the lost symbol is the best thriller dan brown has ever written.	1
	the novel benefits from his skills in developing the former literary elements because they are what make the story complete.	1
	his extraordinary use of plot development, characterization, and symbolism add so much to the story as a whole.	1
	this is why it is a best seller across the nation.	1
	another amazing, mystical robert langdon adventure!!	1
	!.i have never read any of dan brown's works, but i did see both feature films 'the da vinci code' and 'angels & demons' and absolutely loved them!!!	1
	'the lost symbol' is a spell binding, drama filled adventure, and it so exciting action packed, it was hard for me to put down the book to take breaks!!!!	1
	the book is fantastic, including pictures of certain things to help you get an understanding and feeling of what is actually going on!!!	1
	the book keeps you on your toes throughout, with suspenseful action and amazing events which will keep you glued to this book throughout its entirety!!!	1
	hopefully ron howard and tom hanks will team up to bring this excellent piece of fictional literature to the big screen, but hopefully they will do it justice!!!	1
	!      	1
	bad novel.this is the worst dan brown book i have read (i read angels and daemons and davinci code).	1
	davinci code was excellent.	1
	angels and daemons was not that great because of dan brown's 'fake science' that was not necessary at all.	1
	the action was still mostly good and believable.	1
	the lost symbol has a lot of bad 'fake science' and the action and puzzles are not very good.	1
	action does not flow well and a lot of the puzzles are either obvious or not interesting at all.	1
	the book is not captivating and i almost stopped in the middle.	1
	i would not recommend this book and if i had read some of the reviews here i would have never started reading it. 	1
	okay, well then..okay, well then.	1
	dan brown is amazing.	1
	his first book was a super yarn!	1
	angels and demons.	1
	yikes!	1
	(i'm sorry, i don't really know if that was his first book, but its the first i know of).	1
	then there was davinci code.	1
	good.	1
	solid.	1
	didn't have the delicious implausibility of angels, but then again, some would say that's an improvement.	1
	i would probably disagree.	1
	then there was the lost symbol.	1
	wow.	1
	i was primed.	1
	ready for some answers, some insight; enlightenment.	1
	and that would be...i can't tell you, it would ruin the book.	1
	but i was underwhelmed.	1
	yep.	1
	sorry.	1
	it just didn't pan out for me, i'm sorry.	1
	the symbol stuff?	1
	good stuff.	1
	masons?	1
	cool bunch of dudes.	1
	hearts' seem right.	1
	but the book.	1
	the scenes, from one 'magnificent' room to another.	1
	'special cia' treatment.	1
	going from enemy #1 to holiday hero.	1
	i don't know.	1
	its all just too much!	1
	sorry!	1
	i wish i knew what i was hungry for.	1
	maybe it was some way to correlate all this deep, secret stuff with who i am.	1
	or why i'm here.	1
	or what is happening in the world today; i mean, really happening.	1
	how can you write a book, any book, fiction or non-fiction, and not have some of the truth of life, of you, of us, of this great turning we are in, leak through?	1
	because that's what it felt like - a great idea gone awry.	1
	so much talent, so...undirected.       	1
	not quite as good as the preceding books.	1
	first let me say that i listened to the audiobook version so i'm taking that into account when i review this latest chapter in the robert langdon series.	1
	paul michael, the narrator for the audiobook version has always done a great job in my opinion, however in this book.	1
	.	1
	i think it was because of sato having throat cancer and what that did to her voicebox.	1
	..ugh!!	1
	it kept jarring me from the story.	1
	while i am seeing a definite and somewhat predictable formula in brown's works, this book was disappointing.	1
	there seemed to be a lot more narrative exposition in regards to the free masons and the symbology behind the pyramid.	1
	for me, it kept detracting me from the story.	1
	heck, as i'm writing this review, i'm finding myself struggling to remember it.	1
	the only thing i can say on the positive side, is that there's a nice twist toward the end that i wasn't expecting.	1
	with da vinci code and angels & demons, i fell into both stories  but this one left me cold and i couldn't wait for it to end.       	1
	ho-hum....read all other dan brown books, this ranks last.	1
	last week i saw a copy in the junk bin at the tj max store, it fit, beacuse thats where it belongs.dont get me wrong, it was entertaining, but shallow, and bland.	1
	seemed hurried.	1
	better to see national treasure.	1
	if they make a movie of this boring book, it would'nt suprise me, beacuse if it doen't make sense, hollywood will do it.deception point and digital fortress would have been oscar worthy in thier dayif made into a movie.	1
	but it's too late for those, the technology is passing them up.  	1
	speechless in dc.just finished this wonderful book, set in my hometown of washington dc.	1
	about all i can say is that this is probably the best of brown's books.	1
	it has more truths in it than the rest, although 'the davinci code,' rocked my world.	1
	brown takes the reader on a real life fictional story that is based all on facts that he has spent hours researching.	1
	it is amazing.	1
	it is unbelievable and it will give you a sense that we all are loved by our creator and while that love is taken, we also need to be aware that our own religious beliefs may not be as we have been told.	1
	simply put,'god is love,' and we have been created in 'his' image, not physically but mentally.	1
	just a breathe taking journey to places where i have never been, physically and spiritually, but would love to go.	1
	read it!!!!!!	1
	!      	1
	it's ok.many of the reviews really go on and on.	1
	if brown is such a bad writer than why don't some of these 'critics' try to write a novel?	1
	they nearly have in writing a review, you would think they get paid by the word!	1
	the lost symbol is not as good as da vinci code, why?	1
	is something every one needs to find out for them selves.	1
	i feel that robert is not as smart in the lost symbol, the story does not move as fast.	1
	i do feel that dan brown puts a lot of research into the books he writes.	1
	the science of noetics, i've not heard of, i may do my own research or not, does it have bearing on the plot, maybe not but the lady needed to be researching something, right?	1
	why not pick a area that not many have heard of?	1
	anyway if you like dan browns books you will read it, you already have i'm sure.	1
	if you did not read da vinci code, don't bother with this one.      	1
	great book.having read all of mr. brown's books, i have to say, i waited impatiently for this one to arrive.	1
	i was not let down.	1
	i believe mr. brown does for literature what star wars did for cinema.	1
	where the actual story good vs. evil, boy and girl, whatever (now that's good english) is fairly simple, however mr. brown is able to interject history, background and theory that said in other forums would be dry and boring.	1
	i never had an interest in the masons, or washington d.c. until reading the book.	1
	i am fascinated now, and will be planning a trip.	1
	the argument over previous novels is bull (again, good english) and only opened the door for lively debate among intelligent people.	1
	it strengthened my faith by an increase in knowledge of theories and history.	1
	as as novel and loosely based on theories and innuendo, all of mr. brown's books have been very enjoyable reads.	1
	i look forward to the next one.      	1
	worst book yet.my husband and i enjoy dan brown's books and purchase and read them regularly when they come out.	1
	we read this one together, and we were very disappointed.	1
	the plot was much less believable than those in his other books, we found the 'twists' to be predictable, and the writing just wasn't as good as usual.	1
	the end of the book dragged on and on, and we were so relieved when it was finally over.	1
	we will still read his future books, but this one has already been deleted from my kindle, never to be downloaded and read again.      	1
	smart, mysterious, and crazy fun!.i don't know what was true.	1
	i don't know what was real.	1
	but dan brown certainly made every aspect of this novel jump off the page with lifelike authenticity.	1
	and that's all that matters.	1
	i'm not a symbologist or an historian or a student of a particular religious faith.	1
	i'm just a guy who likes to spend a few hours every now and then sitting on his couch reading a good book.	1
	documentary makers and people who write books about books will scrutinize and analyze the facts, pseudo-facts, and myths in the lost symbol for years to come.	1
	but i think if you simply accept that this novel is what it is--a piece of an extremely imaginative and diligent writer's fantasy--then you'll agree with me: this is one very good book.	1
	the lost symbol is a smart, exciting, and fast-paced novel that i found incredibly hard to put down.	1
	besides dealing with freemasonry and ancient codes, it also discusses the relationships between science and faith, humanity and the divine.	1
	this book is not a simple thriller--it's also a book that will leave you with a different perspective on reality...or at the very least washington d.c.!      	1
	it's a repeat of angels and demons but in our nations capital.it's a book that if you are not well informed on the freemasons you will read this book in front of your computer to help you decipher most of the information.	1
	don't misunderstand me it's a great chase and codebreaking story but once again langdon is lectured and then 'everything makes sense' or he see's the picture, even while facing death.	1
	you will also get a history lesson that i'm pretty sure if we had paid attention in high school we would know what and where they are talking about.	1
	it does make you want to visit washington d.c. which is amazingly full of mysteries and hidden history and awesome art and architecture.	1
	langdon gets a call to lecture in washington d.c. but when he gets there he realizes that his friend is missing or rather kidnapped.	1
	a severed tattoed hand in the rotunda,at the precise moment robert langdon gets there and gets one of the many phone calls of the night, the cia who decides it's a matter of national security and on a need to know basis and you don't need to know, and a mysterious man who taunts and orders robert langdon around via cell phone, a couple of 33rd degree freemasons a pyramid( here is where knowledge of masonry comes in hand) the kidnapped peter salomon sister katherine and a few other people who really don't make sense as to what they are doing there but that is part of dan brown's way of writing adding unecessary characters.	1
	you will also know exactly where you are even if you have never been to the nations capital.	1
	noetic sciences play a rather confusing role in this story but it really doesn't give you much information you need to look it up too and by the way it really isn't a science at least i didn't think so.	1
	the history of the freemasons was rather interesting but being a woman there is no way i would be able to join them.	1
	good thing i did not pay full price i got it believe it or not on clearance for a fraction of the cost.	1
	would i read it again?	1
	most likely not.        	1
	great reading !.short chapter style works for me.	1
	unbelievable detail includes thoughts and emotions, location and action, out of box picture as well as minute details.	1
	it wasn't not tiring at all to me.	1
	i loved the way he placed direct thoughts from the characters minds italicized.	1
	the story line was great and the way each chapter revealed more and more but not too much and certinly not too little.	1
	excellent ending and epilogue.	1
	i recall several spot on keeper lines of humour.	1
	i also found the author was equally merciful and evil (both angel and a demon haha) in the latter chapters regarding the fate of the protagonist (that is all i can say without giving anything - you will know exactly what i mean when yor get there).	1
	beware that no matter what you are doing or where you are you will not be able to put this book down.	1
	again, the ending was greatness.	1
	i've never read dan brown before.	1
	this was enough for me to buy his other works.	1
	i hope to see this one as a movie.      	1
	langdon returns!.personally, i absolutely love dan browns books, espacially the slight plot twist involving the villan.	1
	*spoiler!	1
	* for example, in the da vinci code the teacher ended up being teabing, and janus was carlo.	1
	in the lost symbol, ma'alkh is zach solomon (i thought there would be that sort of twist, but since there wasnt really the figure of a &#34;commander&#34; so to speak in this book, i must say that this twist was a bit of a stretch.)	1
	still, this book is great, and i would reccomend reading it if you are a brown fan.      	1
	from triump to turkey.yes, this review is on 'the lost symbol', but i need to begin with 'angels and demons' (contrary to what one reviewer in this section wrote, it was written before 'the davinci code').	1
	a good solid novel it was.	1
	i liked langdon right off.	1
	if i don't like the main character, i can't stay interested.	1
	it's a weakness of mine i suppose, but i have to care about the hero.	1
	i had to skip reading 'the davinci code' when i quickly discovered that brown claimed doggedly that certain foundational elements of the story were fact, when they were not.	1
	'i can't read this!'	1
	i exclaimed to my wife of 50 years.	1
	'i love fiction, but don't try to fool me with nonsense about something as serious as christianity's path to the present.'	1
	i dropped the book with a thud on the coffee table.	1
	she picked it up, read it, and said it was a 'triumph' of story telling, even if it was based on bunk.	1
	that brings me to 'the lost symbol'.	1
	i wish it had stayed lost.	1
	langdon was still there, and i was still rooting for him, but the story was muddy, full of confusing aspects, and i couldn't make myself care enough to give it a good mark.	1
	therefore can't give it more than 3 stars (which means 'okay', i gather) only because of my high expectations.jess duboy, author: wings of forever.	1
	decent storytelling, but predictable and similar to other works.dan brown's latest would've gotten more stars had he cut out about 150 pages or so.	1
	i expected this to have the same 'formula' as 'the da vinci code' and 'angels and demons', and indeed it does.	1
	the usual copious references to all the research brown has done is again evident throughout the book.	1
	if the reader is not a fan of brown's dismissal of christianity, then this is not the book for him/her!	1
	however, from the standpoint of fiction/entertainment, it was a pretty good holiday read.	1
	it goes pretty quickly, as you'll find yourself skimming quickly through some of the chapters since a lot of the storyline is somewhat predictable in many places.	1
	in hindsight, i probably would've borrowed it from someone to read through it instead of the paying $10 to get on the kindle...or just wait for the dvd of the movie to come out...      	1
	easy read, but redundant.i enjoy dan brown because he is, generally, a mental escape from my 'work reading' and such.	1
	his formulae is consistant and predictable, but generally veiled better than in the lost symbol.	1
	over half of the book replayed the same scene from a different character's perspective, adding tidbits and subplots throughout.	1
	the pace of advancement for the storyline seemed lacking; so much so that i began counting down chapters to the end.	1
	the large plot twist was predicted by me to my husband within the first 40 chapters (there are 132).	1
	the book is sub-par for brown, but if you need to read something to keep your mind of your flight's three hour weather delay, it will do nicely.      	1
	written to be a movie.i feel that this book was shamelessly written to be a movie script.	1
	in some places i can imagine it saying on the sidelines 'enter villain'.	1
	that being said, i enjoyed it anyway for the light reading it is.	1
	it is not a religious text, it is not a philosophical text, it is just a thriller/mystery.	1
	if you don't like the man's slant on life then don't read his books.	1
	also, i have to agree that he was getting a little 'robert jordan' with the symbology.       	1
	not sure about all the 1 stars, i thought it was pretty good..sure, this book wasn't as good as the davinci code or angels and demons, but it was still a good read.	1
	it kept me intrigued throughout and the short chapters made for easy reading.	1
	i will admit the last few chapters seemed to drag on a bit.	1
	once the big 'twist' occurred, which i didn't see coming, and the villain was out of the picture, the book kind of slowed down and started to get quite repetitive.	1
	i just wanted it to be over already!	1
	overall, i would recommend this book.      	1
	a screenplay, not a book.i loved angles and demons and the divinci code but lost symbol falls well short of his earlier books.	1
	clearly the author wrote this book (or was commissioned)to write a screenplay for another movie.	1
	as a result the flow of the book is choppy and almost impossible to follow.	1
	my best guess is dan brown as fallen into the trap of success where he found a book theme that works and he's trying to continue the run.	1
	however, he's not a good enough author to pull it off.        	1
	same book over and over again.let me preface my remarks by saying that i admire dan brown's ability to write these thrilling robert langdon tales.	1
	with few exceptions i find his books hard to put down (deception point - not so much).	1
	but my beef with this book is that i feel like it's the same story (or formula for a story) as many of his other books.	1
	it's the same habit that has turned me off of john grisham's books.	1
	the story takes place over a day or two.	1
	robert langdon is enjoying some weekend time and then suddenly he finds himself in the middle of a quest that turns into a chase.	1
	there's a girl.	1
	she's smart and pretty.	1
	there are powerful friends.	1
	there's a conspiracy.	1
	langdon saves the day at the end.	1
	don't get me wrong - i like this book, but i don't know how many more books *just like the da vinci code* that i will be willing to continue to buy.      	1
	slow start, thrills all the way, but ultimatly rather a let down.well, this is dan brown, right?	1
	you're not going to get deep psychological insights or rich characters.	1
	but it does give you a thrilling ride.	1
	this novel actually starts slowly, far too slowly for me, and then picks up pace and leaves you at the end of every chapter dying for more.	1
	however, the details about the masonic links to the us and washington's geography get tiring and pedantic.	1
	and the great insight about the power of human thought is a bit of a let down.	1
	having just read 'while the gods sleep' by j fincham and before that, 'a day in the life of ivan denosivich,'by the russian author, a solzhenitsyn, the first of these an sf novel about the power of human thought and the second a book with incredible characterization, i felt this book was a bit of a let down by comparrison.       	1
	homoerotic awfulness....my wife and i spent several evenings reading this book together, and here are a few observations: 1. after reading the book, i still have no idea what it is 'about'.2.	1
	if real harvard professors are as dumb as robert langdon, i'm glad i went to a state school with 25,000 other morons.3.	1
	dan brown is one sick puppy who wrote this book simply to see how many times (and in how many different ways) he could describe male genitalia - 'fleshy shaft', 'neutered sex organ'?	1
	... gross.	1
	i can't wait for the movie - it should be straight-to-dvd in your local gay adult video store by spring!      	1
	not much different than the others, but still good..i was a bit nervous to read dan brown's new novel because i thoroughly enjoyed his last two so much and it would not have surprised me if this one was not as good.	1
	but to my delight, the lost symbol began with typical fast-paced mystery and intrigue which did not stop until the very end.	1
	i tore through this book at lightening speed.	1
	the lost symbol is different from the davinci code and angels and demons in that it follows robert langdon as he scurries across washington d.c. as opposed to countries in europe.	1
	but it is the same in that symbology, mysticism and secret societies abound.	1
	there is a crazy evil genius as in the last two books and i will be interested to see who plays his part in the movie adaptation (because we all know a movie will be forthcoming).	1
	essentially, the lost symbol has pretty much the same plot as brown's other two books but i still couldn't put it down.	1
	all in all, i enjoyed reading this book a lot, but i am pretty sure this is the last time dan brown can write the same book with different characters and slightly different story lines and get away with it.	1
	i enjoy brown's style of writing and the fast-paced excitement of the plots he creates, but i hope he can come up with something new next time.      	1
	excellent read.as with other notable dan brown novels, the lost symbol has a very imaginative story line, is well researched (although literary license is employed), keeps you guessing and coming back.	1
	although i don't agree with the primary premises of enlightenment, i found the thouoght process and storyline interesting and provocative.	1
	this book was a fun read!       	1
	amazing... what a book!!	1
	!.the lost symbol was probably the best book i've ever read.	1
	i couldn't wait to get off work to read this book, i was walking to work.... reading the book, in my car on my breaks...reading the book.	1
	i would recommend it to anyone.	1
	it was a work of art.	1
	i loved it.	1
	i can't say enough great things about this book!      	1
	not trash, but disappointing.i'll try not to take the low (albeit easy) road and trash this book and its author dan brown.	1
	but, i do admit to being pretty disapointed with it.	1
	i'm not saying it is not a good read, or that i regret the time spent reading it... but it fell short of my expectations - expectations that i think were realistic and fair.	1
	if you picture a common bell curve, with davinci code at the apex, then it gives you a visual indication that the lost symbol begins the turn downward for dan brown's books.	1
	let's hope that this is not a traditional bell curve, and this book is just a depresion in what will be an otherwise good writing career.	1
	i use the bell curve analogy because i have read each of his novels, and i felt that davinci code was the product of a stedily progressive writing skill.	1
	unfortunately, lost symbol takes a turn for the worse.	1
	at times i almost felt i was reading a book on par with deception point again.	1
	what i didn't like about it:    from the early stages of plot development, this book seemed a little weak.	1
	i found myself not really caring that much what the big mystery was, how professor langdon was going to solve it, and what obstacles would confront him along the way.	1
	not that i didn't want to - mr. brown just made it very difficult.	1
	his descriptions of the mundane events and actions in this book are far too wordy and detailed, yet he cuts away sharply at times when further detail and color would be nice.	1
	professor langdon is reduced to a drooling idiot in this book (the reason for my reference to an earlier novel 'deception point').	1
	the good professor is bewildered and befuddled through the entire story - never once taking charge and having purpose.	1
	seems odd that his character is involved in the story because 'only he' can solve the mystery, and 'he alone' is the subject matter expert... meanwhile, he has to have everything explained to him for the entire book.	1
	if tom hanks has read this book, he is surely telling his agent to get him out of any obligation to play the role in the inevitable film, unless he is in the mood for a forrest gump reprise ('momma always said that life was like a ancient symbol'...).	1
	the character of katherine in this story is stupider yet, even though she is a brillian scientist.	1
	she makes all the typical 'dumb woman' moves and decisions that one would expect from a 1950's horror movie.	1
	what a step backwards for women in this character.	1
	and finally - what i liked the least - was the letdown.	1
	hard to describe without spoiling the story, but the payoff just isn't there at the end of this book.	1
	i'm not saying it has no value, but next time mr. brown writes a book, i might just wait for the movie to come out (on cable) - because it seems that he is less concerned with writing a good book and more concerned with following a mediocre hollywood formula.      	1
	disappointment after disappointment after disappointment after disappointment.the first 3/4 of the book give you exactly what you want from dan brown: a lot of fun.	1
	the last quarter of the book gives you: nothing.	1
	if you're like me and find yourself so put off by the astonishing predictability that recurs throughout the book (culminating in an insulting obvious climax), that the last quarter of the book is absolutely painful to read.	1
	put it down.	1
	the last part of the book reveals absolutely nothing.	1
	it rambles and reiterates on and on in meaningless drone.	1
	the last part of the lost symbol completely ruins the whole experience.  	1
	another brown slam dunk....the lost symbol has its own special place in my dan brown 'favorites' list.	1
	i'm a huge dan brown fan, and yet have mixed thoughts about the lost symbol.	1
	i started this book, like a lot of people, with enormous anticipation.	1
	i'm ranking this book #2 on my dan brown list - behind angels & demons, for a couple of reasons.	1
	i was not able to read the lost symbol is large quantities, like i did angels & demons.	1
	a couple chapters here, a couple chapters there...it took me three months to get to page 250.  that being said, i didn't find the first half of the book to be the page turner i expected.	1
	however, because of some down time around the holidays, i was able to read the second half of the book in two days.	1
	i really enjoyed the second half and was unable to put it down!	1
	the ls met my dan brown intelligent writing expectation with another religion/science/secret brotherhood story.	1
	the lost symbol was well researched and written in an interesting style that keeps your attention and keeps you wanting more.	1
	i give the book four stars and recommend to anyone who is intrigued by technology, religion and secret societies.       	1
	fast interesting read.similar to brown's other books in the weaving of historical facts and secret society tid-bits into a fast-moving storyline.	1
	living close to dc with family members in the masons, found this book to be particularly interesting.	1
	even though brown's books are fast easy reads, they typically contain some profound and provocative thoughts.	1
	this book cuts to the heart of religion and the notion of 'god'.	1
	found that fascinating and has led to some great discussions.      	1
	the lost symbol.dan brown has done it again.	1
	the lost symbol grabs you from the first paragraph and takes you on a ride of ups, downs,  twists and turns.	1
	you're never sure what will happen next and cannot anticipate the next change in direction.	1
	brown gives a positive representaion of the masonic mysteries and beliefs.	1
	washington, d.c. is shown as most of us have never seen it before and the ending of the novel is teriffic, giving us the meaning of the 'word.	1
	'i highly recommend this book to those interested in science, mysteries and hidden meanings in the bible, the koran and other religious books.      	1
	this is not the da vinci code!.this book was not as enthralling and wonderful as my favorite brown, the da vinci code.	1
	i am a strict, staunch catholic, but i loved the book as a piece of fiction.	1
	i remember reading it a few years ago on our boat, and being called to have dinner with others.	1
	i could hardly wait to escape to get back to the story!	1
	this volume took me 3 months to read.	1
	granted, i was working daily (read da vinci during summer, off work), but it didn't hold my interest as did his other books.	1
	i have read all his books, and enjoyed all of them a lot (i want to see the movie angels and demons, but i want to re-read the book first; always find the book much better than the screen version).	1
	i liked this book the least of all his other titles.	1
	i will still buy his next title, but this was my least liked of all his other books.	1
	sorry, dan!      	1
	loved the setting but disappointed.it is a huge effort to write a novel, and i respect the process and effort, so rate it 3 stars.	1
	i really did enjoy the tidbits about washington d.c., especially the capitol and the washington monument, and descriptions of the art works.	1
	i wish there had been more engagement with details of place, as in the earlier novels.	1
	i loved the settings of smithsonian pods 3 and 5 - that was great.	1
	wish there has been imaginative constructions about what research katherine was doing and what her findings were.	1
	actually, i was left with the feeling that ideas/material on katherine's noetic science are being saved for a sequel, instead of being included in this novel.	1
	i think more detail about what went on in pod 5 would have made this book much more compelling.	1
	basically it seems that brown is following the 'michael crighton path'  - writing something that is more screenplay than novel.	1
	i was so disappointed.	1
	i read this in 1 day over the holiday, which helps get a clear sense of pacing.	1
	--my first reaction was that the pacing was forced (and made me think 'screenplay').	1
	framing the action with a very short time period was enjoyable, but many action sequences were rat-tat-tat and choppy.--my second reaction was that brown was following advice to 'dumb down' the writing, including changing the way langdon speaks and inserting improbable sequences to push the narrative forward (e.g., dialogue between katherine and character posing as psychiatrist -- completely unbelievable that she would fall for that....)     seems to me brown's writing has changed since the early novels.--my third reaction was that the book was rushed out the door too quickly, with no help (or with bad advice) from the editor.	1
	the concluding 'big insight' was underwhelming, but the overarching metaphor remains powerful and interesting.	1
	it touches on a subject currently getting talk show attention again  -- mind vs. brain (is the mind 'caused' by brain processes or is it embedded in cross-dimensional and/or multi-organism collective consciousness, etc.	1
	).        	1
	do not overanalyze it, just enjoy reading it.i have read the reviews by people who have given this new brown's work a single star.	1
	the reasons?	1
	he is thinking about making a movie out of it; his is using a too structured and repetitive writing style; the characters are supposed to be intelligent but act stupid; ideas were stolen from old movies; the ending was lame; etc.	1
	well, that might be the case but these reviewers have been overanalyzing it.	1
	my personal view of this book, which i had to force myself to put down from time to time so i would not finish it too quickly, is that it was entertaining, sprinkled with science, history, religion, symbology (of course), twists.... and i did like the end!      	1
	a good story, but lacks pizazz.the lost symbol, while interesting and informative (well, to the greatest extent a fiction book can be), lacked the pizazz that angels and demons and the davinci code had.	1
	i loved reading about dc and the capitol building, especially since i was a page and had the opportunity to explore the building.	1
	the sections about the capitol building were accurate.        	1
	an ending to be savored or spit upon.writing a review for this book is difficult, because by the end you will be fixated on the last twist and whether or not you found it believable or cliched.	1
	however, before that one final twist, the lost symbol is an enjoyable ride.	1
	as always brown's play on words keeps you entertained as he 'reveals' facets of history lost to the average person.	1
	his new look at american history and the role masons play is engaging and will drive mason critics and conspiracy theorists wild.	1
	this time langdon has to help out a friend who belongs to the powerful solomon family.	1
	as expected he has a gorgeous mature sister who will join the wild ride as the two are fighting against a mad man who is convinced he has unveiled a powerful mason secret that only the older solomon has access too.	1
	get ready for wild riddles, pyramids, and entertaining play on words, facts, and history.	1
	brown is able to intersect several stories into one novel taking you back and forth from villain to langdon's perspective in no time.	1
	some of the novel's weaknesses include the overuse of the phrase, 'my god!'	1
	and side characters whose roles seem not to be clearly defined are they villains or simply hindrances?	1
	and most of all the final twist revealing how everyone is connected in this huge puzzle, left me disappointed.	1
	i can only assume it is a type of revelation that readers will either love or hate.	1
	i certainly was no fan of it.	1
	the ending seemed frazzled.	1
	why isn't peter going to the hospital and taking his time to reveal this last ridiculous mason secret.	1
	uh...you're missing your hand, sir.	1
	i think secrets can wait or be shown after you're seen by medics.	1
	the mason secret seemed too sugary of an ending.	1
	i think brown wanted to go for a moment of patriotic appreciation, but it seemed force.	1
	this definitely is no da vinci code, but it's an easy beach read.	1
	expect nothing more than that and you'll be satisfied.      	1
	not worth it (your time, that is).i loved angels & demons, da vinci code, and deception point.	1
	this book however, was a different story.	1
	most of the detailed reviews (esp the one by garvinstomp) have covered it:- the ultimate reveal is pathetic.	1
	in fact, it's not really a reveal at all.	1
	throughout the entire book, langdon tries decipher a pyramid object that promises to reveal an 'ancient mystery', the source of a great wonderful knowledge, one that the masonic society has closely guarded for generations.	1
	when you finally realize what this wonderful knowledge is, you can't help but wonder: really?	1
	hardly worth guarding with your life.	1
	and unlike the other brown novels, there isn't any big 'twist' at the end either to give you a sense of satisfaction at having finished the book.	1
	- why is noetic science even in this plot?	1
	it barely has anything do with the main plot.	1
	take it out and get rid of half of the useless words.	1
	- seriously, do yourself a favor and read the plot summary on wikipedia.	1
	that is all the 'meat' in the book (the rest is mostly frivolous details like how many bulbs were in a chandelier, or the color of the doorknob).	1
	then decide if you want to read 500 pages to find that out.	1
	you'll thank me.	1
	- overall, the plot is slow, the characters spend too much time in very few locations (unlike the other two langdon books where he kept running around, here they simply talk, and the author fills the gaps with descriptions of the surroundings i couldn't care less about), and the ending isn't much of an ending at all.	1
	it really feels as if dan brown has run out of mysterious symbols and ancient legends to make stories out of.	1
	unfortunately, he really doesn't need any of that to make a good story (think deception point).	1
	instead he attempted to cash out on the da vinci code fame by continuing the here-are-some-more-startling-ancient-myths-that-are-true-and-have-shocking-consequences theme.	1
	unfortunately, the glaring lack of material and substance showed.      	1
	the symbol got lost as well as the meaning.as a member of ions (institute of noetic sciences), i read 'the lost symbol' to see how well dan brown would write about noetic scientists' consciousness research, about symbolism, and of course, i also read it for entertainment value.	1
	i noted that brown spent quite a bit of time at the beginning of the book setting up the details of the research lab used by noetic scientist katherine solomon; however, he never does a thing related to noetic science with this intriguing set-up nor does he connect solomon's work in any way to the sub-text of symbolism and mysticism running through the book.	1
	brown doesn't demonstrate understanding of consciousness research and i found myself having to read through endless pages, looking for a depth that simply doesn't exist in this book.	1
	i usually don't read thrillers and i have not read 'the da vinci code'.	1
	i am therefore an easily-drawn-in novice and i allowed myself to be pulled forward by the action in spite of some pretty gruesome violence and some pretty silly so-called 'esoteric' moments with the masons.	1
	i was expecting a meaningful payoff that never came.	1
	certainly i am now more intrigued by places in washington d.c. that i now would like to visit, but dan brown completely forfeited the opportunity this novel gave him to provide genuine spiritual wisdom/insight and current information on the scientific research into consciousness.	1
	instead, he went for masonic ritual (yikes!)	1
	and then for some shallow statements in the last few pages of the book where he named a few sacred texts and general concepts.	1
	however, none of the characters in the book are made capable of providing insight into spiritual practices nor into their research results.	1
	concepts like 'thought', 'mind' and 'energy' are all run together in about 5 sentences as if they're the same thing; how they relate to whatever 'symbol' is found (or not found) is completely oblique.	1
	quite a bit of text in the last few pages is devoted to generalized discussion and then to talking about the bible as a text providing spiritual wisdom; the character katherine solomon exclaims that the bible contains 'scientific information' when in fact any in-depth student of the bible knows that the early mystery teachings containing the practices which can and have been researched and that can lead to realization of god within, were taken out of the bible by the church and can now be found only in places like the nag hammadi library [...].	1
	also, brown's statement 'the science of noetics .	1
	.	1
	.is the study of human thought' (pg.	1
	498) is not accurate.	1
	i recommend looking into the real institute of noetic sciences [...].	1
	i would not recommend this book to anyone who really wants to understand what our lost symbols are or what they mean.	1
	one of the book's themes - that it's a national security threat if the public learns that some of our leaders practice masonic rituals - is pretty silly.       	1
	not worth the time or money.dan brown has become formulistic (ok - not a real word, but hopefully you get the point).	1
	the plot was predictable and the ending - well just lousy and didn't even make sense or resolve the plot line!	1
	definatly not worth the time or money to read it!	1
	i won't be reading another dan brown book!      	1
	dan brown does it again!!	1
	!.i've read all of dan brown's books, i would say this is probably tied for my 2nd favorite.	1
	my favorite is angels & demons, t-2nd is deception point.	1
	in addition to being entertained, when reading his books, i feel like i'm learning something.	1
	the lost symbol continues in that tradition.	1
	i always find myself google-ing things from the book to learn more.	1
	though many of his books have had some religious components, the component in the lost symbol is truely unique!	1
	if you're a fan of dan brown's, you must add this to your collection!	1
	if you've yet been introduced, this is a must read as well, but i would start in the order of their chronology: angels & demons, the davinci code, and then the lost symbol!	1
	happy reading!!	1
	!      	1
	huge disappointment-hard to top davinci code, but not even close.i agree with some of the more detailed descriptions so i will keep this short.	1
	i loved the da vinci code, i found angels and demons terrifying and gripping.	1
	deception point was pretty good too.	1
	i was absolutely disappointed in this book.the characters didn't make sense and you can't connect with them.it read like a stilted movie script.the ultimate meanings of the symbols was a huge let down.it read like a stilted movie script.the ending was weird and awkward.it read like a stilted movie script!i almost didn't finish angels and demons because the evilness was so overwhelming.i almost didn't finish this one because it was boring.i am really glad i borrowed this from the library.      	1
	formulaic, repetative letdown.i liked robert langdon in a&d;, but in symbol, i find my self bored by him.	1
	my main problems with dan brown and his writing is this (and really it's not as bad in these latest books of his but if you have ever read dp or df by him, you will know what i am getting at): he will imply something, then he will tell it to you, then he will tell it to you in more detail, then he will go in to torturous amounts of detail explaining every little deduction, analysis, and fact as to why what he's showing you is what is happening.	1
	i didn't mind as much in a&d;, perhaps because i was actually extremely fascinated by the science supporting religion theory, but in dp, df (especially df!	1
	), dvc and ls, all i could think is why am i reading this?       	1
	too many flaws to be a good read.first, the pros: the book is a reasonable page turner, and some of the historical concepts are well researched.	1
	also, it is probably the only known book that glorifies washington, d.c. the cons: 1. dan brown's writing style - he writes a novel like a screenplay, almost like he is visualizing the movie that will (inevitably) be made from the book.	1
	2. i won't get into details here, but the reason for all the action in the book (cia involvement, et al) left me cold at the end of the book.	1
	dan brown really needs to think long and hard about what exactly constitutes a 'national security crisis'.3.	1
	after all the criticism he got for going against one cult-like organization in the da vinci code, he seems to have decided to go hog-wild in favor of another one in this book. 	1
	c+...major letdown after.....the da vinci code and even angels and demons.	1
	maybe it was the pedestrian atmosphere of dc compared to the historical intrigue of paris, london and the vatican.	1
	maybe the implications of discovering/revelation of the 'ancient secrets' in the lost symbol is pale compared to the fidelity of the ideals of western civilization or the destruction of the vatican/rc church.	1
	prominent us leaders acting like drunken frat boys at a cult meeting?	1
	maybe cable coverage for a week?	1
	and the role of katherine is murky, as opposed to sophie and vittoria, who are intricately linked to the plot.	1
	she is a researcher in noetics, the science of the mind, and the main plot is based on the masonic tradition of symbols and codes, and why is mal'akh so obsessed with her and her work?	1
	she had nothing to do with his past and her lab was unrelated to his quest, which is even murkier.	1
	what was his ultimate goal?	1
	we do not really know, even at the end, unlike silas or the carmelengo.	1
	maybe the masons (ben franklin and harry truman?)	1
	just do not evoke darkly mysterious images, like the templars, priory of scion, opus dei or the illuminatti.	1
	maybe the secret word does not galvanize the imagination as much as the holy grail or anti-matter.	1
	maybe the melancholia cannot match up with the mona lisa or the last supper.	1
	so, let's all 'hope' that db and the professor earns a better grade next time, and especially, that tom hanks passes on this one.       	1
	the lost $ymbol.okay, it's christmas, i feel generous so i give dan brown four stars.	1
	robert langdon seemed to have become a bit slower than he was in angels and demons and davinci code.	1
	he is frequently sought for his knowledge, yet he often seems to think, 'no itt can't be, but then again, i guess it is!'	1
	the violence appears to be written for hollywood.	1
	and yet, well, if there's a popcorn movie then there's such a thing as a popcorn book.	1
	and this is it.	1
	dan, this must be more fun than teaching at a prep school.       	1
	a page turner that leaves you disgusted at the end, one of the worst novels i have ever read.i read this book in one continuous session - finished reading it at 5 o'clock in the morning.	1
	i am a huge fan of all previous dan brown's works, as they were fairly well-written, sophisticated, and entertaining reads, with believable and reasonably well developed characters.	1
	somehow, for me, 'lost symbol' was also impossible to put down.	1
	a page-turner?	1
	apparently, when nothing makes sense, it may resemble a puzzle.	1
	in reality, this book as a well-disguised pile of trash, rigmarole, and hallucinatory almost sick fantasizing on religion, history, and mysticism.	1
	i regret buying and reading this book and would not recommend it even to the most faithful dan brown's fans.	1
	no matter how much you may have loved 'da vinci code' and 'angels and daemons', chances are, 'lost symbol' will hugely disappoint you.	1
	first, most characters are bleak, weak, undeveloped, and their motives and actions are poorly substantiated and rather irrational.	1
	robert langdon's character is so boring that it is difficult for the reader to feel for him or to care about his ordeals.	1
	moreover, the plot becomes utterly ridiculous at times.	1
	for example, i can't believe a person who has just lost a quart of blood, a person who nearly drowned, and a person whose hand was cut off several hours ago may engage in a long in-depth conversation on historical and philosophical matters while running for their lives several hundred steps up and down the stairs.	1
	second, the plot concept is so far-fetched and overloaded that the characters had to engage in numerous several-pages-long conversations to provide the reader with sufficient information about particular aspects of masonic history, legends, etc.	1
	without these history lectures inserted into the text to assist the reader in plot comprehension, reading simply cannot continue.	1
	third, towards the end, the ritualistic elements overwhelm the plot, and the story becomes completely idiotic and unbelievable.	1
	the reader continues mainly in fading hope of eventually being able to make order out of increasingly chaotic mess of historic facts, legends, and sick fantasy.	1
	yet, the ending is so bad and anticlimactic that i felt intellectually insulted.	1
	strongly not recommended even to those who consider 'da vinci code' to be a masterpiece.	1
	dear hollywood, please, don't bother with a movie version of this crap.  	1
	painful read.the 'lost symbol' was a very, very painful read.	1
	i kept turning the pages hoping for something to arrest my attention and found nothing.	1
	about half of the book is absolutely unnecessary.	1
	up to about a third of the way through the book, i still had no clue where we were headed.	1
	the plot was fuzzy, characters were shallow and the language was limp.	1
	it had no pace except that the author managed to but enough words together to fill page after page with nothing.mr.	1
	brown needs to take a loooooong break before putting words in print again.	1
	this one was really horrible.      	1
	shallow characters, terrible theology, but some good twists..dan brown's latest novel spins a good tale with some good twists.	1
	it's also a great read before visiting d.c., and will help you narrow down the myriad of places to tour.	1
	that's all the good i have to say about it.the characters are shallow.	1
	the pace of the book is so unrealistic that it pulls you from the dream we usually enjoy while reading a novel.	1
	you would think they evacuated washington in order to do all that is done in this book.	1
	i don't care if it's midnight - there are always people everywhere in d.c.  you can't blow up the smithsonian and the library of congress and then expect to drive across town without seeing ten million emergency vehicles, and at least that many tourists.	1
	but that's not what bothered me.first, let me say i could care less about the controversy of the davinci code.	1
	i didn't read the book and didn't follow all the clamor.	1
	i thought the counter-publishing of works like the davinci deception were reactionary and overkill, not to mention probably did much to promote anything brown subsequently wrote.second, it's a novel - got it.	1
	the views expressed herein don't necessarily reflect those of the author, bla bla bla.	1
	but there's no way you can read this and not sense that the philosophy within the writing goes far beyond backstory, character or scene development.	1
	it sounds more like soap boxing.	1
	so, what philosophy?brown levels the differences among religions, stating that they all have value and originate from some ancient, vague mysticism.	1
	the book is gnostic, wrapped in the most recent package.	1
	'truth' originates from secrets kept from centuries past within a small circle of masons, or other secret organizations.	1
	even within those groups, only a few people really understand the truth, which is guarded within enigmatic symbols to protect the world from the destructive effects that would come should the unworthy gain access to these powerful secrets.	1
	hold on a second - i've got a fair question: what secrets?	1
	what exactly is the secret?	1
	well, he never says.	1
	at the end he references (and, baby, does he twist scripture here...) the logos (see john 1:1).	1
	but even here he takes what scripture makes fairly clear, and casts a cloud around it in order to manufacture a mystery.	1
	this reminds me of finding forester, which was a wonderful movie.	1
	in this flic sean connery plays a famous, best-selling author in the vein of harper lee, who only wrote one novel.	1
	connery mentors a talented kid from a poor, inner city neighborhood.	1
	throughout the movie your told how incredibly talented connery is, how wonderful his book was, and you wonder what else he has published, and how good it is.	1
	the problem - you can't demonstrate how good literature is in a 90 minute movie.	1
	so you have to believe that connery is that good, because they're never going to prove it through prose.	1
	brown does something similar when he spends an entire novel debunking orthodoxy while lauding gnosticism that he refuses to explain.	1
	it's a secret.	1
	if i tell you i'll have to kill you.yeah, right.	1
	i find the novel arrogant.	1
	i had to exert will power to finish the book after the third time one of his characters pontificated on how `simple minds actually take the bible literally.'	1
	what does he mean by literally?	1
	well, for starters he's not just talking about believing in a seven day creation, or a literal flood, or some other doctrine typically held by fire-breathing fundamentalists.	1
	he extends it to include believing in a literal resurrection, a literal christ, etc..  he places jesus on the same level as mohammed and some obscure prophets from religions known only by harvard anthropology professors, in spite of the fact that they teach contradictory things.	1
	(e.g.	1
	did jesus die on the cross?	1
	koran says no, bible says yes.	1
	it can't be both.	1
	was he resurrected?	1
	koran, no, bible, yes.	1
	they can't both be correct.	1
	and the entire religion of christianity hangs on the answer to these.	1
	they are not trivial doctrinal issues.)	1
	jesus (and mohammed) for brown are just good folks who had a better grasp on some grand ancient mystery than most people.	1
	unfortunately most of their followers have twisted their teachings by actually believing them, rather than grasping the enigma behind what they actually taught.	1
	oh - if only brown had gone so far as to draw a cartoon of mohammed, we might be spared some future experiment in thrashing orthodoxy!such is gnosticism redressed, a heresy dealt with centuries ago by the early church.	1
	it basically says, 'i have a secret, and if you have the secret, you can know salvation.	1
	but to really be saved, you have to know the secret.	1
	so i find it arrogant and frustrating that he insults christians (and most other faiths) for being simple-minded because they believe their scriptures.	1
	if you shoot down one answer, you should at least offer your alternative.	1
	he doesn't.	1
	instead he offers vague references to some hidden mystery.	1
	he can't disclose the mystery because he misses the point.christianity is a mystery.	1
	the logos he refers to is certainly mysterious, but not in the way he intends.	1
	he is guilty of his own lust for enigma, claiming christians were staring straight at the answer and yet miss it.	1
	i would say this is the case for mr. brown, since we stare at the mystery and walk away with the answer.	1
	he twists the mystery and walks away with another mystery of another mystery of another...  he walks away with air.	1
	nothing.	1
	gnosticism.	1
	humanism.	1
	weak philosophies build on shaky foundations.	1
	still, it could be a good book if you took all the empty philosophical trash out of it, built more complicated characters, and adapted the setting to more accurately reflect a really cool capital city.      	1
	lost plot.let's see there robert langdon the ever so bland, tweed jacketed protagonist that every female protagonist in the books seems to have some sort of ambiguous romantic connection with.	1
	a couple of characters who you are not sure whose side they are on and of course the gimp-like s&m;, muscular religious psychopath.	1
	how many of these books can we take?	1
	i can't take anymore.	1
	the plot was a ridiculously jumbled mass of history and legend.	1
	the book should have probably ended 100 pages earlier.	1
	i would rather read a nicholas sparks book before reading another dan brown book (and that is really bad).      	1
	i wish i hadn't found 'the lost symbol'.oh my god.	1
	can you say tedious?	1
	i just finished listening to the audio book, yes all 17 1/2 hours of it, and i felt like throwing myself out the nearest window and hoping i would impale myself on an obelisk aka pyramid.	1
	holy christ can this guy blow wind.	1
	this should have been a 9 hour book max, but it drones on and on and on and on.	1
	i wouldn't listen to this again at gunpoint!	1
	i wonder how many times the words: mystical, mythological, symbol, ancient wisdom, etc appear.	1
	after listening to this i had to do some self-electroshock therapy.	1
	i'm now listening to the best of yma sumac!	1
	haha.      	1
	reminds me of a talking heads song.we're on a road to nowhere .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	come on inside.	1
	taking that ride to nowhere .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	we'll take that ride.	1
	yep, this book was a road to nowhere.	1
	absolutely absurd.	1
	a totally empty and disappointing ending to a supposed 'thriller.'	1
	it took me a month of on-again, off-again reading to make it through the first half of the book.	1
	finally i committed to plowing through the rest and seat-belted myself to the couch until i finished it.	1
	thus the second star.	1
	ugh.	1
	just typing this review is heightening my frustration over this book.	1
	so regardless of the depth of redunculous thought i could share about the one-dimensional characters, silly plot, empty premises and repetitive literary devices, i think i'll just stop now.         	1
	i read the whole book for that?.not to rehash what others have said, but in a nutshell, the big secret isn't a secret at all.	1
	langdon goes through all these efforts to decipher a legendary, mythical pyramid and it points to ... an everyday object.	1
	it's like brown had a good idea (sort of) for a new symbologist book, but nothing in mind for the end.	1
	when he got there, he just threw something in that sort of fit with what he'd already written.	1
	without totally spoiling the book, the end is a dramatic letdown, and a waste of time.      	1
	more plot holes than swiss cheese... absurd!.no big plot spoiler here for those of you who haven't read it (why do people do that here in amazon reviews???)	1
	so you can read on and not miss any thrills.	1
	i'm going to reference a couple specifics which give you the tone of the whole book - the reader is expected to go along with any of dan's plot devices, no matter how amazingly absurd.	1
	the unecessarily pitch-dark pod 5: early on we here the the gigantic outer area leading to the research room can't be lit because an electric power grid would disturb their delicate experiments.	1
	however there's plenty of power in the room where said experiments go on, thanks to a hydrogen power cell.	1
	i assume this power is used in bulbs of some sort, as well as powering lots of equipment.	1
	power gird.	1
	and why can't a hydrogen cell be used to create low lighting out in the pod, unless dan is setting us up for a dramatic chase-through-the-dark scene?	1
	so having survived the chase through the unecessarily pitch-dark pod 5, catherine gets to her car.	1
	now we know she's lost her coat because she has no door key-card so, um, how's she gonna drive?...	1
	'her keys were where she always left them, in the center console'  what???????	1
	yep, she's part of a zillion dollar research project so this is a $50k+ car and she leaves it unlocked with the keys in it.	1
	nice little escape device, dan - i mean your escape, not hers.	1
	two small examples of the absurdities in this very weak followup to da vinci.	1
	enter at your own risk, it's mildly entertaining so long as you don't mind sloppy pop fiction. 	1
	interesting concepts, boring delivery.if you thought this book, a cornocopia of interesting washington/masonic facts and  metaphysical philosophical concepts, would keep you hooked even if the writing was sub-par...how wrong you would be.	1
	it quickly becomes apparent brown sent a team of interns to go washington and then crammed their research into a book, regardless of whether it added to plot of the story.	1
	did we need to know every street sign in dc?	1
	did he have to try so hard to appear like he understands how simple technology (like google search engines!)	1
	works?	1
	i think not.	1
	this disappointed reader wonders whether brown is going to keep pumping out books for the money, or, like his earlier books, will actually take the time to publish something of value.      	1
	the lost reader.i'm a big brown fan.	1
	i can't put his books down until i've devouredthem...until this one.	1
	it was a bad sign when i couldn't read more than 10chapters in one sitting w/o getting disgruntled, disturbed or plain bored.	1
	thepremise is the freemasonry history and its connection to dc which should'vehooked me in.	1
	and although i learned a lot, it seemed like i had a long way togo to learn what i did.	1
	the last 3 chapters, after the big reveal, was nothingbut dan brown realizing he still had research material that he hadn't used so hehad his characters just spouting of exposition after exposition.	1
	painful.	1
	as for the mystery.	1
	we learn that the mason's have been protecting the ancientmysteries which have been handed down from ancient egypt.	1
	all religions haveguarded the ancient mysteries.	1
	the masons don't have a faith and they havemembers from all religions.	1
	so it is made clear repeatedly that the masons arenot a christian order.	1
	but they've constructed this pyramid that has the key tofinding the ancient mysteries to a great power source.	1
	the worthy who canunlock the code of the pyramid and its capstone will have the power of a god.	1
	enter the most 'awesome' of all brown villains.	1
	he's bald and secretly tattooedand has joined the masons to get access to the highest branches to find thesecret.	1
	he doesn't get it so he kidnaps the high master and throws langdon intothe fray to help solve the mystery or else his friend dies.	1
	so there are codeswithin codes, symbols within symbols, and at the end s p o i l e r s you realize the villain is the high master's long-dead son who was offered theanswer to the ancient mysteries and turned it down.	1
	he's so altered now bysteroids, drugs, tattoos and dark arts that even his father and aunt neverrecognize him.	1
	okay...so a great deal of irony there.	1
	and i guessed his identity the minute he refused to give his name.	1
	now for the ancientmysteries.	1
	what were the mason's hiding in d.c.?	1
	what is the power source?	1
	what will make the worthy have the power of a god?	1
	wait for it....it's the bible.	1
	yup, the freemasons apparently have been guarding this pyramid since the age of ra to protect what is buried in a land that had yet to be discovered, in a city that had yet to be planned, at the base of building that had yet to be built, hiding a book that had yet to be drafted while all the while proclaiming that freemasonry is not a christian order.	1
	it.made.no.sense.	1
	the lost symbol should be re-titled as the lost reader.      	1
	the formula is getting tired.dan brown really needs to try a new direction.	1
	his novels are a replayed formula that's growing increasing tired.	1
	the davinci code was original and thought provoking, but he keeps reapplying the same formula to every subsequent novel.	1
	robert langdon, check; intelligent female partner, check; singular, super-dangerous antagonist, check; wealthy benefactors, check; race against time in the course of one evening, check.	1
	seriously, thats the plot to davinci, angels & demons, and now lost symbol.	1
	the only thing that changes is the city and the nature of the threat.	1
	in this case, however, the antagonist is not only singular and super-dangerous like an albino assasin, or a hired assasin, he's a totally shaven, tattooed, weight lifting mystic, but at least he's not an assasin - he just kills people at need.	1
	i did find the historical bits about washington dc interesting, but otherwise this is just rehashed dan brown.	1
	it was entertaining, but his novels are beginning to read like madlibs.	1
	pick a city, pick a threat, pick a womans name, pick an antagonist, and crank out a novel.	1
	i've come to expect better from brown, and he's let me down.       	1
	left cold ....while i loved angles and demons .. liked the davinci code .. the lost symbol left me lost.	1
	i was disapointed in the lack luster role given to robert langdon.	1
	i agree with the idea of looking into ones self in order to find a greater connection with god ... but i felt the plot of the lost symbol never really got off the ground and for some reason langdon just seemed to be playing stupid in this novel.	1
	i will not recommend to anyone.      	1
	typical dan brown entertainment.	1
	'the lost symbol' is pretty standard fair from brown.	1
	it contains all the basics--some mutilation, a pretty female scientist, an ancient mystery enshrouded by symbols that will change the world and a creepy bad guy.	1
	oh, and of course, langdon--the expert symbologist.	1
	that being said, i did enjoy the book.	1
	it's fast and fun and packed with interesting tidbits of history, symbology, rituals and secret societies.	1
	it's exactly what i expected from brown--fascinating entertainment and thrills with some intellectual stimulation on the side.      	1
	brown knows his symbols!.i have read all of dan brown's books and couldn't wait for the release of the lost symbol.	1
	though it started out with the usual excitement and intrigue of his other books, it seemed to rely increasingly on the unbelievable as the book progressed.	1
	there were several times when i actually threw the book down and said 'this is just ridiculous' out loud.	1
	my husband asked which part i had just read, and then agreed with me.	1
	having said that, i still recommend this book; the author gives an incredible amount of information about the symbols and religious origins of our nation.       	1
	could have been written in half as many pages....i must say i agree with some people here.	1
	while the lost symbol is interesting, it is long winding and leaves you with a definite feeling of anti-climax.	1
	while i was prepared for the book to be a bit redundant at times (his books always are), this book had way too many pages to process.	1
	does anyone else think all his books featuring robert langdon essentially have the same storyline?	1
	robert langdon gets caught up in something and has to crack some kind of code from centuries ago while being coerced by an perverted, sick lunatic.	1
	i liked parts of the book, especially about arcane symbols, codes and centuries-old plots.	1
	but couldn't it be set against a different backdrop?	1
	he knows his art and architecture, but the science part can get a little fuzzy.	1
	all in all, definitely not worth the money spent...but is a nice one-time read.      	1
	a solid book..you've been hearing a lot about this book.	1
	i know this because, as we've established, you have an internet connection, which means you live near civilization, or at least somewhere that people are saying things.	1
	if not, well...ugh, i don't have anything witty to say.	1
	i liked this book.	1
	i'm kind of pissed at the critics who had their reviews written before it even came out (or before they even read it), jumping on the 'i hate dan brown' bandwagon.	1
	then there are the people who call him a bigot or an anti-christ or whatever they want to make up.	1
	usually these are people who read the da vinci code and had their christian belief system challenged for the first time in their lives, and somehow thought that complaining about it would do damage to mr. brown.	1
	well, it didn't, and those people are kind of foolish.	1
	the best way to give notoriety to something is to make it controversial.	1
	if you don't believe me, check out the sales of all the books that people have tried to ban from public schools, starting with obscure titles like the adventures of huckleberry finn.	1
	anyway, to the actual book: it was well-done.	1
	it was still a signature dan brown novel in the sense that some of the writing was outright crap, meaning either brown still hasn't proofed his own writing, or his editors are just thinking 'why should i try?	1
	it's got brown's name on it.	1
	it'll sell.'	1
	i got kind of tired of him saying his own characters' names over and over again--first and last together.	1
	'kathleen solomon did this, and then kathleen solomon thought about something else.	1
	like robert langdon.	1
	meanwhile, robert langdon was walking down the hallway.	1
	robert langdon looked down at robert langdon's watch.'	1
	seriously dan, it's okay to use words like 'he' and 'she' once in a while.	1
	also, we know there's only one robert you'll ever be referring to.	1
	it's cool, man.	1
	in comparing this book to the other two langdon novels, i'd say it's better than da vinci code and tied with angels & demons.	1
	a&d; remains his smartest book, whereas the lost symbol is going to make the best movie.	1
	i think the villain in this one was extremely well-motivated.	1
	he probably won't have the 'shock value' of the a&d; villain, at least not when you find out who he is, but his actions throughout the book made you really hate him.	1
	like, you want a bus to just completely run him over.	1
	that's the mark of a well-done villain.	1
	the plot centers on the society called the freemasons and a secret they carry.	1
	supposedly it's the key to 'apotheosis', or becoming a god.	1
	the villain wants to know the secret, and he tricks robert langdon into figuring it out for him--or at least, he tries to force langdon to find what he needs.	1
	from the big shocking intro, you have a few things that are trademark dan brown: long intros of important characters with backstories, a brutally long and drawn-out drowning scene, a few chases, and lots of flashbacks into previous lectures langdon has given as a harvard professor.	1
	still, in this story, langdon has to get his hands dirty, and he goes through a lot more physically than he did in the other books.	1
	it takes place in washington dc, making this the second dan brown book to do so (the other being deception point--still my favorite).	1
	it shouldn't surprise me that his two best books take place in america :-) all patriotism aside, i am pleased with the outcome of this book, and for one major reason: it actually has meaning.	1
	da vinci had some controversial application, but was ultimately fiction; a&d; supposedly stoked the coals of the science-versus-religion argument, but most (if not all) of the religious people i know have no problem with science and its pursuit.	1
	lost symbol, on the other hand, has a really great message about religious tolerance, and opening one's mind up to exploring the existence of god.	1
	it's not in the form of heavy-handed lecturing from the all-knowing langdon, either; langdon himself finally has to confront his own atheism, which is nice to see.	1
	brown pulls him out of the role of a static character, and langdon does some nice self-evaluation.	1
	when he does argue, he does it in defense of the freemasons--a society whose purpose and practices are grossly misunderstood by the masses.	1
	when characters in the book refer to the masons as a cult, or as satists, langdon forces them to back up their claims and not be so judgmental--after all, the practices and tenets of nearly all religions can be made to sound cultish and sinister if told with the right slant or bias (a point which the langdon character handily illustrates in a flashback scene).	1
	i could go on and on about that, but the point is, this book (despite its technical flaws) was better than i expected, and i'm glad brown's main character had to learn something for once.	1
	it helped the reader to really learn something as well.	1
	if you liked his other books, you'll be more than satisfied with this one i think.	1
	oh!	1
	and funny side note: he takes a pot shot at his own book digital fortress in lost symbol.	1
	it was rather comical.	1
	if you've read df, you'll know it when you see it.       	1
	disappointing, though freemasons will love it.i wanted the lost symbol to have the same 'couldn't put it down, stayed up till 4 am to finish' quality angels and demons, da vinci code and deception point had.	1
	alas, it took way too long to get into the story and it went on well past the point it should have ended.	1
	it was easy to figure out the real identity of the villain and having done so, his motive and actions just weren't credible.	1
	the lost symbol would have benefited from a good edit.	1
	i think it would have been a much better read at 350 pages.	1
	at 500+, the suspense was diffused, and it was easy to find flaws.	1
	it seemed to me that the characters were flat and the action scenes padded to draw them out.	1
	my major complaint was the lack of character development.	1
	perhaps if we knew what events had shaped sato, katherine and katherine, or if we knew exactly why mal'khi turned out the way he did (the reason given wasn't enough), it would have been more convincing.	1
	as it was, the reader wasn't invested enough in the characters to make for compelling page turning.	1
	the bad guys who turn out to be good guys or is it the other way around?	1
	who are mr. brown's specialty weren't very interesting.	1
	other flaws include a tattooed villain weirdly reminiscent of a thomas harris character without enough at stake to justify the story, some not very interesting tangential story lines and the earthshaking threat was 'meh, so what?'	1
	and what could have been a riveting late night chase through dc was sidetracked too many times and in too many ways by too many bumblers.	1
	there were some good elements.	1
	the research into noetics was interesting, if tangential (i kept hoping katherine would save everybody with a little practical noetics), there were some nice scenes inside national landmarks (though how weird is it that robert langdon would fall asleep on the catwalk under the capitol dome), and mr. brown's trademark gimmick of turning the familiar on its ear was there, if dimmer than hoped for.	1
	the nice elements seemed to be buried in filler, though.	1
	the lost symbol will be interesting for freemasons, if only to check mr. brown's facts and i don't doubt it will make a great movie.	1
	the right script will tighten up the story, and good actors will create convincing characters.	1
	it just didn't make a very good novel.	1
	i apologize.	1
	the lost symbol.another typical dan brown book, this time leading us on a 10 hour tour of washington dc's monuments and their ancient symbology.	1
	the capital comes to life as brown describes in exquisite detail the nation's monuments and the artwork found within.	1
	this aspect of the book is always what i have found most fascinating in his novel, and the lost symbol did not disappoint in this regard.	1
	langdon's long time friend and mentor, peter soloman, has summoned him to washington to speak at a conference.	1
	much to langdon's suprise, when he arrives he finds that a mysterious man has kidnapped peter and was actually the one to invite him, but not to speak at a conference, but to solve an ancient mystery in exchange for peter's life.	1
	i was disappointed a little by robert langdon himself.	1
	i'm getting a bit tired of his character.	1
	i enjoyed him in angels and demons and da vinci code, but he has not grown thoughout these stories and he needs a little something extra added to his character if brown intends to continue the series.	1
	the journey through the capital is fast paced and draws you in, i had a hard time putting the book down when i needed to.	1
	the cast of characters are wonderful, but the suprise twist is was a little too easy to figure out if you paid attention.	1
	while i greatly enjoyed the story, the last 50 pages or so seemed more like an addition to the story after the fact.	1
	they did not quite fit with the rest of the story and kind of ruined the ending for me.      	1
	a disappointing sell-out....it pains me to write this, but this book was awful.	1
	i've waited for dan brown's next installment for what seems like forever.	1
	i bought a copy as soon as the bookstore opened on its release date, blasted through the first 300 pages, then realized, &#34;i'm not enjoying this.&#34;  the langdon character mimics tom hanks' portrayal much more than previous literary installments.	1
	the controversial noetic science is simply boring and can't stand up to the captivating nature of the cutting-edge religious fodder of the previous langdon books.	1
	i had the highest hopes of reading the next great dan brown book.	1
	what i got was a sell-out, published for the sake of piggybacking off the success of two lackluster movies.      	1
	disappointing effort by brown!.on a positive note, the subject matter was interesting and some historical facts in it were fun.	1
	the scientific facts were very interesting and the symbology was fascinating.	1
	having said that, this book was a huge let-down!	1
	i loved davinci code and angels and demons was at least plausible (most of it) but the story line itself of the lost symbol is completely unbelievable.	1
	the main villain in this story is absurd, i think a high school student could come up with something better.	1
	most of the time, i was turning the page hoping it was going to get better.	1
	and most of the time, i was saying 'oh, come on!'	1
	and was just amazed that dan brown would put his name on this book.	1
	what happened?	1
	he needs to fire his editor and anyone else that had a hand in this crap!	1
	if i was mr. brown, i'd be embarrassed!	1
	if it comes out in a movie, i don't even know that i'd watch it, especially if they follow the storyline because its completely unbelievable!	1
	dan brown is assuming that his readers are idiots.	1
	anyone that reads books today implies some level of intelligence; a level that dan brown did not meet in his latest book.	1
	i was sorely disappointed, after being excited.	1
	i was amazed i made it through the book.	1
	it had alot of parts in it that were completely unnecessary... literary fluff.	1
	i felt insulted as a reader to think i would buy such a poorly-turned story.	1
	really, if you're a dan brown fan and want to stay that way?	1
	don't bother!	1
	seriously!      	1
	better luck next time.after reading angels and demons i read all of his books.	1
	aad was by far his best work, and an incredible one at that.	1
	the other books were not bad, but not memorable.	1
	this one however was terrible.	1
	i lost interest about half way through.	1
	it took me awhile to actually finish.	1
	i did not understand, or care about the ending.	1
	i don't even remember the ending.	1
	it it too bad because he is a good writer and he took so much time to research the masons.	1
	he could have just read 'rule by secrecy' by jim marrs and then pumped this book out in 3 months rather than making us all wait for 5 years.	1
	you're a great author brown and you know we will buy your next book, so please just try to write a good one.       	1
	a good weekend read.a fine addition to the dan brown series.	1
	i finished this book in a cold winter weekend when staying inside was the best option.	1
	much easier to visualize if you have been to washington dc.	1
	overall, a good fiction read.	1
	a complete letdown.i have been a big fan of dan brown's all previous novels.	1
	the plot of his previous novels are thick and although too descriptive have always a good 'cause.however this book has no plots and puzzles that just keeps going on and has a complete dud end.	1
	also the characters come out as extremely weak.	1
	for e.g.	1
	why would the hero just bring a critical artifact along without as much as an after-thought.	1
	why would they break a seal which was kept unbroken for more than a century, with many sacrifices just  to save a man.	1
	the explanations given show the characters as very weak individuals.and the ending was a complete failure..  and i agree with the another review comment - fire the editor.	1
	frankly after reading this, i don't think i am gonna read another dan brown novel for a long time       	1
	a pleasant read, but ending falls flat.i read da vinci code and angels/demons and they were excellent.	1
	this is a good read - not great, but good.	1
	the adventures and historical clues are similar two the other two books and sometime in dc i'd be interested in checking these locales out.	1
	i felt the plot started a little slow, but the pace picked up quite a bit and didn't want to put it down.	1
	the climax of the book was surprising/excellent, however the conclusion was flat and uninspiring.	1
	the religious references were clever yet the lack of detail to explain such references was a letdown, as if dan brown didn't quite know where to go with them once he brought them up.      	1
	disappointed.dan brown's lost symbol reads almost like a book report on dc and the symbolisms described.	1
	i find it too academic.	1
	i've lived in the dc/va/md area for 4 years and am familiar with most of the places dan brown described.	1
	it's disappointing that the places are described devoid of the human factor - i don't get the sense of the pulse of the place - living and thriving with people, events, traffic, accidents, power - the center of the us' political hub; where a majority of the country's federal structures are located - with at least 5 military installations within 10-30 miles of each other - the south and north of the civil war - home of the old colonial rich - there's so much to talk about to give the story flesh and blood.	1
	i think dan brown also tried to be religious towards the end of the book - a discussion and interpretation of christian tenets which could be misleading.	1
	i also got confused with when the story is supposed to be taking place - mainly because of confusing references to technology.	1
	the appointment made with dan brown was made via voice mail and then fax - does anybody still make appointments via fax as a backup reminder?	1
	this made me think maybe the story was set in the 80's.	1
	then towards the end, there was a reference to twitter - w/c made me realize the story is supposed to be current - like 2008/2009.	1
	the plot seems to be revolving around a lot of the characters just taking things for a fact  and not verifying or validating the information or situation presented.	1
	given the high degree of intelligence of most people involved, and the wealth they possess, one would think that it takes just a few minutes of their time to verify things for security purposes - it would seem the characters are gullible, or reckless or naive.	1
	the one high point in the book for me is the revelation of the killer's identity - w/c i think is a good twist and threaded the events together.	1
	however, it would have been better if dan did not use the first person reference in the introduction of the killer - w/c seemed to be an inconsistency when the killer was revealed.	1
	a third person or passive narrative of the events at the turkish prison would have provided more integrity to the plot and consistency to the build up towards the end of the story.	1
	am i missing something here.i like dan's work but i have to agree with the other people who have posted their opinions about this book.	1
	i was excited when i heard about it but disappointed when i read it.	1
	i'm not expert but i've enjoyed his other works so much and was just wondering what i've missed while reading this one.	1
	on the upside of this, there are good stories in all of us.	1
	some are just better at writing a book than some (like me lol) but hey, i'm a huge fan of dan brown and will keep reading his books.	1
	sometimes we need to look beyond the bad words and editing problems and just enjoy a good story, right? 	1
	what an absolute let down.there are only a very few authors that i call my favourite and mr. brown was one.	1
	it is unfortunate to see the quality of work go down this fast this badly.	1
	i don't know if its because his hollywood deals or some pressure to produce more books in short time, whatever it was, the outcome is bad and i think mr. brown would concur himself, that is if he can bare to read this book himself.	1
	i firmly believe that the book was written so it may one day become a movie and that intention in itself is enough to kill the quality of the book.well this would be last time i read his book, same thing happened to john grisham, an a-list author who started mass producing books and lost quality and fans.	1
	the novel, if you do get to the end wil leave you with the huh-what the ....	1
	expression!!!	1
	i'm actually sad to have lost yet another talented author to hollywood!	1
	captivating, but characters are flawed..first off let me say that the story is captivating and the subject matter interesting.	1
	a very fast past read.	1
	however:(i'm going to try not having a spoiler but just in case, you may not want to read further.)	1
	this book contained the worst characters ever written in fictional literature.	1
	especially robert langdon.	1
	i must say that his skepticism in the story was tying and sickening;  i mean come-on.	1
	your are robert langdon.	1
	what have you been doing in the past two books?	1
	dealing with antimatter, church vs. science, finding decedents for jesus and so many fantastic and outrageous situations that we love so much.	1
	in this book however, he does not believe anything to be possible.	1
	what happened, did dan brown murder your sense of adventure.	1
	furthermore, he became the wimpiest character of all time,  god bless falstaff.	1
	if i were to give mr. tom hanks any advise i'd tell him not to do this movie for the sake of his career.	1
	mr. brown please don't feel as if you need to commercialize yourself to win audiences, you already had us at 'da vinci code.'	1
	what we (at least i) loved about you was your controversial sense of adventure and set of brass balls.	1
	it seems as if you are softening up and tried to please certain groups (you know who i mean.	1
	)this next comment may be a spoiler:i'm confused;  if i had a friend who was in danger and all i had to do was decipher something i did not believe in (because i'm such an skeptic)  to save him, i'd do it; not argue with terrorist about how untrue it is and i won't do it because it is not true:me:  i won't do it it's not real,terrorist:  decipher the code and your friend will be safe.me: but it's not true.terrorist: all you have to do to save your friend is decipher the code for me.me: but nothing will come out of it.	1
	it's impossible.      	1
	he has done it again....all of dan brown's books are amazing.	1
	but this book ranked first in my database of at least a thousand books.	1
	dan brown has spun an intricate tapestry of the freemasons.	1
	the amazing thing is that dan brown has used truth, but also strayed from the truth while making a completely believable tale.	1
	katherine's work made me want to try it out myself.	1
	i found myself longing to become a mason.	1
	his story is completely believable.	1
	maybe he is right about us being god ourselves and that we are creators.	1
	i, myself am a very scientific person, an athiest.	1
	i believe that religion is just a way for people to get away from all of the bad stuff.	1
	even so, all of a sudden, i found myself wondering and believing that this type of thing, however unfathomable may be true.	1
	dan brown is my favorite author, for he makes me think hwile entertaining me with a somewhat true story about things that people have been pondering for years; things that scholars never figure out.      	1
	the ending ruined it all for me..the lost symbol early-on worried me with its phd heroine concluding that her break-through research has 'proven without a doubt' that prayer and the mind-alone can cure diseases.	1
	for more on this futuristic technology read the 1875 book, science and health with key to the scriptures, by mary baker eddy.	1
	worse, after all the truly absurd escapades are finally resolved, dan brown sermonizes a lengthy diatribe about man-god-nature and vague musings on how the bible is a misinterpreted lost symbol.	1
	on the plus side, brown vigorously absolves freemasonry from any wrongdoing, and acknowledges that all religions are essentially equal.	1
	thanks, dan.      	1
	reviews from brizmus blogs books.the lost symbol will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with bated breath, wondering what's going to happen next, fingers crossed that it's not what you think it will be.	1
	it's an intriguing fast-paced read that will sometimes leave you short of breath.	1
	dan brown masterfully weaves old myths and truths about the freemasons into his extraordinary tale, thus giving the reader an exciting history lesson along with this fabulous read.	1
	it will leave your imagination running wild.	1
	i found his presentation of noetic science to be fascinating, and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.	1
	on the surface, 'the lost symbol' is just another thriller, but, especially towards the end, dan brown turns it into so much more for the attentive reader.	1
	he asks intriguing questions that have no answers.	1
	and then he proposes answers.	1
	he preaches the importance of unity, open-mindedness, and understanding, and he manages to do this without proselytizing (although it did at some points feel didactic).	1
	one of the key themes of 'the lost symbol' is religious tolerance, and dan brown presents a convincing case that really, all religions are one and the same.i'll say something i've said before: there has been quite a bit of hoopla over whether or not dan brown is actually a good author or whether he just got lucky with 'the davinci code.'	1
	i can't say.	1
	i don't feel i have any kind of qualifications to judge whether or not an author is 'good' or 'bad.'	1
	what i can say is that i loved 'the davinci code,' i liked 'angels and demons,' and i loved 'the lost symbol.'	1
	it kept me excitedly turning pages until the very end, and for me, that's what's most important about a book.	1
	it also taught me something and made me curious to learn more, which, again for me, is also extremely important in a book.that's not to say that it was perfect.	1
	there were times when it got extremely repetitive.	1
	someone had a revelation, and in the next chapter a different person had that same revelation, and in the chapter after that, another person would be having that revelation, and so on.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	you catch my drift.	1
	there is also the small problem of robert langdon himself.	1
	i get that he's a skeptic, but i think dan brown took his skepticism too far in this book.	1
	he would take ages to come to some completely obvious understanding, just because he didn't believe it could be true.	1
	he's supposed to be a smart man, but at times, in large part because of his over-played-out skepticism, i sort-of thought he was an idiot.	1
	still, in the end, it was exciting and anything but slow.	1
	an utterly enjoyable and informative read.      	1
	starts with a bang... ends with a whimper.-----spoilers----- the plus is that for the most part, the lost symbol kept my attention and i was able to finish it in three days.	1
	it was fairly entertaining in that i could see it like a movie, which it will probably be made into.	1
	on the minus, it was formulaic, predictable and repetitive.	1
	as with any dan brown book, it was chock full of interesting facts and information but after a while, it became a repeat lecture of the same facts.	1
	the biggest disappointment, however, was that there was no big secret.	1
	the 'lost word' is nothing more than the bible hidden beneath the washington monument.	1
	breaking news: this is what the masons are guarding with their lives.	1
	but my how it was built up for the reader!	1
	i was expecting this wondrous, mind-blowing revelation.	1
	what a let down.	1
	i just couldn't understand how peter solomon could put everything at risk to protect this of all things.	1
	even at the climax, he still gave the lunatic mal'akh/zachary the wrong word to imprint on his head.	1
	out of fear of what?	1
	that he would go out and get a bible?	1
	heck, the loon probably needed some jc in his life.	1
	another thing i found bothersome was peter solomon's behavior after the dust settled.	1
	the man just found out his son had come back from the dead as a twisted monster to exact a cruel and vicious revenge on him, and then watched him die a horrendous death again.	1
	so tell us peter, how are you going to respond to this traumatic event?	1
	duh, i'm going to have an intellectual debate with my bud robert langdon and then i'm going to take him sightseeing right now at this very moment.	1
	but that's not all, i'm going to blindfold him along the way because i don't want him to know how to get to this secret location called the washington monument.	1
	what a cheap suspense device to a complete let down, mr. brown.	1
	i had actually guessed that the hiding place was under the washington monument half way through the book and i am no expert on anything related to the masons or symbols.	1
	so i couldn't fathom how robert langdon, selected by a madman as the only man on earth who could solve the masonic pyramid's encrypted message, couldn't figure out where in d.c. there existed a large stone, with a pyramid shape, surrounded by two concentric circles, carved with a message, named after a prominent mason, etc.	1
	etc.	1
	etc.	1
	i will say again that there was a lot of interesting and fascinating information in the book, the most notable being the part about noetic sciences.	1
	i definitely think that bit provided some food for thought and i personally look forward to seeing some of the breakthroughs that are mentioned in the book.      	1
	not as good as the others.after reading the da vinci code and angels and demons this book was a bit of a disappointment, not bad, but my expectations were maybe too high.	1
	most of the book was ok, but at critical points when in a high energy situation the character breaks out into a diatribe lasting a couple of pages on the meaning of some obscure symbol.	1
	then it took a while to pick the flow up again.	1
	it was almost like the book was finished and the editor told him to go back and add a few thousand words.	1
	overall it was a good read, just slow at times.      	1
	not my favorite read from the author.while dan brown's first three books i read were incredibly engaging for me, this one left me feeling a little bit like watching great previews and then being disappointed when i saw the movie.it felt too much like national treasure.	1
	the facts are intriguing and enjoyable to read about, but when i was reading it, it felt like brown was reaching for a story to sell, instead of writing a great story that would sell anyway.maybe he's writing movie scripts now instead of novels.	1
	there just wasn't the character development and great plot line that the other books had.	1
	this is definately a book that didn't live up to the hype.	1
	it's better bought in the sale section after a nice discount.      	1
	exactly what i expected.i would say i am surprised that so many people have been writing negative reviews of this novel and saying that they find it dissapointing when compared to the da vinci code, but given the hype of the da vinci code i think this is to be expected.	1
	if you were expecting the secomd coming of...well...you know, then this novel probably would dissapoint you.	1
	but just like angels & demons and the da vinci code, the lost symbol is simply a great thriller written by an author who is an expert at hooking you from page 1 so that you keep turning the pages.	1
	now is this the greatest book ever?	1
	no, it is not.	1
	is it a little silly and over the top at times?	1
	yes, but so are his other books.	1
	but as far as thrillers go, the lost symbol is about as good as it gets.	1
	shakespeare this is not, but a great 'beach read' it is.	1
	i am not going to analyze all the plot details, but i will say that i found it refreshing that the action took place in the united states this time.	1
	maybe i found it more interesting since i attended school in dc, but still, the fact that it took place out of europe made it feel at least a little different then the two prior robert langdon novels.	1
	and the main bad guy in this novel is a really bad guy.	1
	i thought angels & demons and da vinci code were both really bad movie adaptions as they were dull and so workmenlike, but if they cast the right actor to play the part of the heavy in the eventual adaption of the lost symbol, they will be going a long way to assuring it's the best movie adaption of these novels.	1
	also, i can usually spot the predictable 'reveal' or surprise at the end, but this book's reveal did take me by surprise.	1
	my only gripe is that after the big reveal and conclusiin of the main plot, the book keeps going for another 30 pages of explanations that felt a little extraneous.	1
	so i would recommend this book easily if you liked dan brown's prior novels, especially angels & demons and the da vinci code.	1
	but if you keep your expectations realistic and just go in expecting a really good thriller and nothing more, you will most likely enjoy this novel very much.       	1
	the lost quality in writing.the lost symbol, by dan brown, is interesting for about the first third of the book, with some word derivations i didn't know and some historical revelations about the masons.	1
	after that, it got progressively less educational, more far-fetched, and downright boring.	1
	i was extremely disappointed by the time i finished it.	1
	on the spectrum of books by dan brown, i rank angels and demons and digital fortress as good reads, the da vinci code as weak, and the lost symbol as clearly the weakest of his works to date.	1
	unfortunately, it will probably make the highest profit for him, encouraging a further degradation in the quality of his research, story composition and editing.      	1
	the search for a symbol that isn't even lost..i really enjoyed his first 4 books (angels and demons was my favorite).	1
	so as not to cover ground previously gone over - let me just mention what i think is the most disappointing thing about this dreadful novel (aside from the anticlimactic-pointless-banal-you've got to be kidding- ending followed by a second longer and oh so boring ending attached).the best part of the dvc and a&d; was their use of existing art and architecture to provide clues and keep the mystery churning.	1
	they always made you want to see these statues - buildings - paintings etc.	1
	here there is a little of this at the beginning - but then the there is just a fictional, manufactured puzzle - a multi-part artifact that is a puzzle designed only to be a puzzle.	1
	what a letdown!	1
	nothing to see in a new way, nothing to google, nothing to learn or whet your curiosity.	1
	a little bit about murals and architecture, a little about masons, a completely irrelevant tiny subplot about a puzzle statue at the cia that has nothing to do with the story... this was a really bad dan brown knock off.	1
	unfortunately it was by dan brown.	1
	and since i can't help myself - the final mystery wasn't one, and the big crisis wasn't one.	1
	if you or i were presented with the big crisis, i think most of us would stop, think, and say 'um, ok, back to bed, goodnight'. 	1
	fails on margin.much of the book dwells on a very long sequence of grotesquely violent and bizarre attacks---violent crimes.	1
	these appear to have no inherent value in themselves.	1
	it is not obvious that they teach a lesson or give some insight into the darker side of human nature.	1
	they appear, in this context, merely as gratuitous and mindlessly ugly violence.	1
	many great works of art have unattractive elements.	1
	even beethoven's great ninth symphony has excursions into the minor key and passages that are troubling, at best.	1
	however, great art more than offsets these excursions to the dark side.	1
	the ninth gives us the ode to joy that can hardly fail to awaken the greatest pleasure and optimism in anyone.	1
	because brown has a long and profound excursion into ugliness, he 'runs up a big tab,' and he can be expected to pay back for this with interest.	1
	the coinage that he has available to pay us back, as readers, is the 'ancient mystery' or 'western mystery' tradition.	1
	this is not simply verbiage to mislead children or gullible adults.	1
	something of great worth and importance---something real and valuable---is signified by the 'western mystery' verbiage.	1
	if mr. brown made that more real or more credible or more accessible to his readers, then he would have a great chance of paying back the bill he ran up with many early chapters of unrepentant violence.	1
	in my mind, he fails entirely to give any substantial notion, and leaves the reader with the idea that this may all be smoke and mirrors, something designed in a cynical way, to sell books.	1
	so, it could have worked---but it doesn't work at all.	1
	it certainly would work for a reader who finds palpable significance in the 'ancient mystery' area, as presented here.	1
	i had the chance, months ago, to interview a very accomplished and thoughtful author, dierdre mcnamer.	1
	i tried to play the villain with her, saying that fiction was itself useless, and so, unworthy of attention.	1
	she was too kind of jar me out of my silly game.	1
	the truth is that fiction need not be garbage that is simply 'all made up.'	1
	carefully constructed, it is the opportunity to hold up to mankind a mirror that shows a clearer vision of where we are, who we are, and where we're going.	1
	a photographer can only photograph what is---not what is to be or what ought to be.	1
	that's why we need art.	1
	that's why we need real literature and meaningful fiction.	1
	this book is not art, but it is extremely good business.	1
	with mr. brown's previous track record and his publisher's business model, this book will be a superbly successful business venture.	1
	that's what it is---a business venture.	1
	it is not art.	1
	it is not literature.	1
	it's rubbish, and that's the kind phrasing.	1
	it was wholly unworthy of the precious time i devoted to reading it.      	1
	page turner but ending disappoints, also 'flashed on' has got to go....this book kept my interest with numerous twists and turns and a plethora of interesting history, symbology, and speculative 'science'.	1
	but i found the ending to be a big disappointment, in fact after reading the whole book in a day and a half i couldn't even make myself read the last few pages.	1
	also, one thing kept distracting me which i also recall from davinci code or one of his other books: when the author uses the term 'flashed on' to describe when someone is remembering something.	1
	it seems like an attempt at saying 'remembered' in a hip way, but it is infuriatingly distracting and pulls me right out of the fiction.	1
	i guess you could say i flashed on the fact that he had used 'flashed on' in the past.      	1
	the last 100 pages are unrealistic.i have read all dan brown's books and really appriciate the hard work and research that went into them.	1
	the lost symbol, however, seemed like a rush to the finish line, read like a screen play, and the twists and turns were not built up to that 'no way' that you would get from the others.	1
	this book was unbelieveable at best.	1
	i can't see fans taking tours of d.c. the way they did in rome over this book, and i absolutely hate the fact that langdon didn't seem like the same guy he was in the first two, but more like tom hanks who absolutely murdered his charicter in the movie.	1
	it's a shame.	1
	500+ pages was a welcome follow-up, but in the end my time felt fairly wasted with this story.	1
	dan brown should consider a do-over on this one...and get back to the roots he started from, not go and change his charicters to adapt to the movie screen.      	1
	failed to get me invested..the dvc wasn't the 'tough to follow' book, that was angels and demons.	1
	a&d; was an exceptional book, dvc a good book (though the marketing was exceptional).	1
	i honestly feel this book is a bit of a disappointment.	1
	the repeated use of the hook, disbelief and then the reveal, caused me to give no credibility to events described.	1
	so if someone dies, i came to expect they weren't dead as i'd lean later.	1
	most of the time i was right.	1
	at it's core, the lost symbol is an endoresement of superstition and mysticism in the form of a novel.	1
	verifiable fact is mixed with legend skillfully, so as to obscure truth, really what superstition and mysticism does best.	1
	it's sort of the antithesis of a crucible which burns away the irrelevant and unfounded.	1
	i also felt the love interest in the story does not succeed emotionally as you follow it, it's pale and undefined in it's relationship to he characters.	1
	since this reveiw is not about dan brown (i don't think i could ever write an 'angels and demons'), but about the work, the lost symbol.	1
	if you feel the need for adventure in your life, and a belief in some ill-defined ancient wisdon, wrapped up in worship of a diety... this book may be for you.	1
	if not, you may, as i did, find its foundations to be the recognizable tribute to superstition.      	1
	this one lost me....let me first off start by saying that i am definitely a fan of dan brown.	1
	i enjoy the integration of factual items, places, events, etc into a fictional novel.	1
	it really leaves you wondering if there is another side to what you have been told or have come to know.	1
	that being said, this novel fell short of the expectations i had for dan brown.	1
	although it was pretty much impossible to create another masterpiece like the da vinci code, angels and demons ran along the same lines and was entertaining.	1
	but it seemed like for the lost symbol dan brown had only half of the facts and hoped that he could cover up his dead end research though a 'gripping' story.	1
	sorry to say, it didn't work.	1
	here's my beef with this novel: 1) it is the same cookie cutter formula as his other two books of the robert langdon series.	1
	i understand that each author has his/her own formula, however this was extremely repetitive.	1
	let's get a slightly different plot.	1
	2) the book was very predictable.	1
	i knew what was coming a mile away even though this book attempted to give you twists and turns and leave you hanging on.	1
	and mind you these 'attempts' were often just incomplete chapters that lead you into the next 10 chapters so you can basically read what you knew was going to happen.	1
	3) there was really no development of noetic science.	1
	i personally love the concept of it, but it really didn't have anything to do with the plot.	1
	it's almost as if dan brown was trying to incorporate two deep ideologies that just don't quite fit.	1
	stick with the noetic science and develop that.	1
	4) there was such a build up in the novel for some spectacular 'thing' that was going to be revealed.	1
	and at the end of the book you realize that you've been duped.	1
	5) there needed to be more character development.	1
	there were so many characters being thrown in and out.	1
	and even now i am still questioning what happened to some of the characters in the book and what the point of their introduction was.	1
	6) there were a lot of open-ended items that dan brown did not go back and explain them.	1
	the kryptos statue.....have no idea what the hidden message is and i'm not sure if that was the point.	1
	the bible buried in the obilesk...what are the hidden messages?	1
	don't leave me hanging.	1
	like i said, i do appreciate dan brown's books.	1
	however i think there needed to be a bit more nurturing of this novel so that it could have reached its true potential.       	1
	brown's celebration of a magical washington.	1
	initially i resisted reading this book, thinking it would have to be derivative and trashy, a literary equivalent of 'national treasure.'	1
	but i couldn't be more wrong.	1
	it demonstrates oncemore brown's unique skill for finding the exotic in the arcane, revealing washington  d.c. as a rome of hidden art treasures, which is fitting, since one of his many fascinating insights is that the city (per brown) was actually intended to be a new rome.	1
	whatsmore, the book is a brilliant tour de force of amazing twists.	1
	brown is an extraordinary gifted literary magician, misdirecting the reader over and over before leaning forward to pull the quarter out of his ear.	1
	i only anticipated his tricks once.	1
	otherwise he fooled me again and again.	1
	i can't even remember being so totally taken in by a novel, ever.	1
	while one might sneer at the 'new age' type of mysticism that runs through the book, brown does a brilliant job of justifying it as not new age at all, but in fact a uniquely american phenonema, perfectly fitting with his theme of washington d.c. being a magical place, founded by men whose feet were as deeply rooted in the world of the occult as in the bible.	1
	and always, being written, by brown, it reads like popcorn.	1
	enjoy!	1
	more high adventure for adults.dan brown's adventure-prone professor robert langdon returns, this time manipulated by (yet another) mysterious, disturbed lone wolf into finding a treasure trove of ancient knowledge, hidden by the masons somewhere in washington, d.c.  discrediting and tearing down the masons is also part of the villain's plan.	1
	don't expect the level of searing (credible or otherwise) revelation as 'the da vinci code' and you'll enjoy this fascinating, pulp-inspired thriller just fine.	1
	in fact, i found the book to be entertaining for pretty much the opposite reasons as 'the da vinci code':  the earlier book was a decent page-turner mainly due to its incredible postulations (again, believeable or otherwise) about christianity and history, with the thriller plot being serviceable at best.	1
	this time, the thriller plot, more skillful and involving than before (though slightly predictable here and there), was the main attraction for me, with the 'incredible revelations' being kind of interesting and fascinating, but nowhere near as earth shattering or memorable as the previous book.	1
	so, 'the lost symbol' is still a perfectly good book to curl up with, but for somewhat different reasons than the previous langdon adventure.	1
	i also liked the underlying theme of the book, that we should be less worried about a possible afterlife and more awed and fascinated by our species' potential here on earth.	1
	of course, the book isn't entirely satisfied with mankind's more obvious areas for growth and improvement- our intellect and capacity to address the world's problems if we really try- but rather suggests that we have some manner of untapped brain power that will ultimately allow us to perform actions approaching the magical.	1
	but this is a thriller, after all, so i guess the inclusion of fantastic material like that is okay... especially when it's in a book that puts forth the laudable view that one can respect and be guided by religion, while not being driven by its every tenet.	1
	if you enjoyed 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code', i can't imagine not at least liking a little this latest entry in the series.	1
	it's a perfectly fine installment, and makes me hope it's not another five or six years until we next see robert langdon running through some dark, murky corridors in search of an amazing clue to an even more amazing revelation.              	1
	unfortunately disappointed..the lost symbol had all the potential to be a book worth printing 5 million copies.	1
	i am a big fan of dan and i jumped at the chance to borrow a friends copy of this book.	1
	i started reading it hoping for all the things he has delivered in the last couple langdon books, unfortunately i found it lacking a bit.	1
	certain scenes served no purpose, through the beginning langdon seemed kind of pompous as if dan knew he was successful and through his writing rode on that fame a little.	1
	almost every chapter seems to have a cliff hanger .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	even if the cliff is somewhat small.	1
	'and then he whispered the secret.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	.'	1
	~end of chapter~~beginning of new chapter~ so and so had no idea what the secret meant ~insert meaningless garble here~.	1
	if we are not going to understand the meaning of the 'whispered secret' then why cliff hang?	1
	it won't make any sense either way and it will instead irritate us that you made us wait to read nonsense.	1
	another point of aggravation was his constant soap-boxing for the masons through the beginning of the book.	1
	it seemed he was constantly meeting people that didn't like masons or distrusted them and he felt the need every time to defend the masons as if he were preaching to the readers through the book.	1
	i hate an author that preaches at me through his work.	1
	terry goodkind did it all the time and i don't read him any longer.	1
	not sure i am going to read the next book.	1
	to me there seemed to be little puzzles in this book.	1
	i am close to the end of the book now, and some things that could be interesting are happening, but i am feeling not that compelled to read because i just know that there is going to be some pretty absurd un-realistic things happening and i don't want to get to that point.	1
	not sure what else to say other than his books are starting to be cookie cutter books.	1
	insert dramatic opening, langdon is arranged to be there somehow, he sees puzzles he is framed (somehow) and then runs from the police through the entire book as he strives to stop some inevitable event that happens within the same day.	1
	there is geography, history (which i tend to like in his books even this one), paintings and science.	1
	all the same stuff from before.	1
	of course i expected the science and all that, but it is the same structure through the three books.	1
	maybe in the next one, for a change, langdon won't be a fugitive and will instead work with the police instead of following his hero complex.	1
	could really have used some editng.this book is an ok read.	1
	as usual with dan brown books, it acquaints you with some new disciplines and novel information, and in this instance, tells you a great deal about the traditions behind the masons and how they relate to washington dc and the founding fathers.	1
	i do genealogy research, and many of my family were masons, so i found this interesting.	1
	but this book rambles--a lot.	1
	there are long-winded dialogs from the bad guy's point of view.	1
	long-winded explanations and then some key points glossed over.	1
	i could have edited 100 pages out of this book and made it better, and no one would have missed what i cut.      	1
	who shot the editor?.i was pleasantly surprised by the lost symbol.	1
	in a my-blind-date-was-a-bit- plain-but-that's-good-because-i-was-expecting-roseanne-barr kind of way.	1
	other than that, not by any measure was this a remotely good book.	1
	from voices 'as soft as falling snow' to 'bewildered applause' to 'rocketing' suvs, we're once again assaulted with prose that is clumsy, amateurish, and anything but subtle.	1
	the only well-turned phrases in the lost symbol are those that are left spinning in their graves.	1
	the plot, such as there was, was both contrived - what luck!	1
	all the principals are dc bigwigs; a century on all the clues are still hanging about literally within blocks of each other - and riddled with dei ex machina.	1
	plot twists, when not completely nonsensical, are often (e.g., mal'akh's true identity) telegraphed chapters earlier than brown intended.	1
	and brown continues to patronize, hand-holding his readership through even the most obvious points (e.g., the etymology of 'sincere').	1
	character development is typically brownian: either underdeveloped (robert 'day late, dollar short' langdon); grotesquely over-the-top ('i'm such a work of art' mal-akh'; sato); or far too dependent on cliche - from night-goggle-wearing, laser-sighted-rifle-bearing, black-suv-driving, spy-speak-spouting cia agents (who, at one point needing to commandeer a civilian vehicle, manage to commandeer - wait for it - a black suv!)	1
	to the star of the show: a secrecy-riddled, death-ritual-performing, cabalistic masonic order so far out in left field it was hard to keep from guffawing my way through the climax.	1
	bad acting abounded -- characters were continuously 'stunned' or 'reeling with shock' or 'recoiling in horror' -- and the whole story felt like wading through a movie-of-the-week teleplay, with dan brown's (in)famous mini-cliffhangers all ending with 'fade to commercial break'.	1
	nearly every mystery brown sets langdon up to solve is nothing more than a cheap word game.	1
	is the lost word literal or metaphorical?	1
	brown spends half the book toying with his readers on that point.	1
	langdon finally solves the riddle of 'the order eight franklin square' when, in a brilliant burst of intellectual acumen, he realizes he's misplaced his comma.	1
	and - in an effort to prove that even  punnery isn't beneath him - brown reveals that squares are not really squares, but that legends are indeed legends.	1
	sort of.	1
	(don't ask.)	1
	brown's facts, historical and otherwise, are as confused as they were in the davinci code: falcon 2000s don't have pratt and whitney engines; alexander graham bell did not send the world's first 'wireless' message; traceroutes don't do pings; jefferson redacted the bible not seeking hidden messages but simple to eliminate the miraculous; the washington monument is a) not the highest point in washington, dc, b) was never legislated to be, and c) was completed nearly a generation later than brown seems to think; kalorama heights (google it) lies south, not north, of the national cathedral; the conveyor belt system in the library of congress has been out of commission for a decade or more; isaac newton was never a freemason; etc., etc.	1
	and the preaching!	1
	this being a work of fiction, i normally wouldn't mention it.	1
	but i had to sit through entire chapters of neo-gnostic prattle so banal and confused it makes new-ageisms like 'the secret of the universe is one hand clapping' seem like theological profundities by comparison.	1
	and, as noted by many other reviewers, the denoument was so convoluted i'm still not sure what secret the masonic order thought it was protecting.	1
	it couldn't have been the ancient mysteries themselves, as brown asserts they're preserved throughout the corpus of history's great religious texts.	1
	nor can it be either the verbum perdo or its location since, as it turns out, neither was the verbum ever perdo (nearly every american home has at least one copy), nor has it ever been a secret that there's a you-know-what buried you-know-where.	1
	in short, the biggest secret of history turned out to be an unsecret.	1
	and that, had i been peter solomon ready to sacrifice my life and my family, would have left me seriously peeved at the order.	1
	now, having said all that, i don't entirely blame brown for its faults.	1
	both it and the davinci code (like the harry potter series) were clearly in need of a good editor.	1
	but alas, i understand editors are dinosaurs in the publishing industry, and a good many authors these days are seeing print without their essential services.	1
	brown, apparently, is one (rowling another).	1
	so, because there was the germ of an interesting idea here that could have been salvaged, i give tls two stars.	1
	and that's a shame.	1
	disappointing.i'm glad that i got the book from the library and didn't pay anything to read it.	1
	i suggest that others do the same.	1
	while the plot is interesting and i ended up reading the entire book, i was itching to cover the pages with red pencil.	1
	it could have been half as long and been much better.	1
	the lost symbol is ideal for something like a long flight, but doesn't measure up to angels and demons or the da vinci code.      	1
	frustrating.the story was enjoyable and showed promise (the masonic stuff is weird and interesting) but it was signficantly hampered by the continuous hammering away on the 'all religions are the same' and 'modern science is a pale reflection of ancient wisdom (as are modern religions)' themes.	1
	honestly, this book reminds me of that happened to tom clancy as his later novels turned from tightly wound page turners to platforms for going on and on about his own brand of reactionary idealogy.	1
	this advocacy all happens through the characters.	1
	it kills the story.	1
	the other problem is that if these ideas were truly put forward and the author was forced to support and defend them on their merits, they wouldn't stand up for a minute.	1
	more importantly, no one would bother to read it.	1
	so the author, who can write a great story, has the characters blather on and on about the idealogy and the reader must endure it to get to the story.	1
	that is frustrating.	1
	seems a bit of a fraud.      	1
	not dan brown's best.i've read all of dan brown's book and i must say, after waiting a couple of years for the release of this 'ultra-secretive' and guarded book, i must say i was disappointed by the anticlimactic 'the lost symbol'.	1
	don't get me wrong, i liked almost all his other books, but 'the lost symbol' just doesn't deliver on the premises it builds upon in the first chapters.	1
	like all of dan brown books, 'the lost symbol' is very much written like a movie, but something was different about this one, almost as if he tried to make it too much like a movie on purpose.	1
	i was actually very curious to see where the story would take the very interesting field of noetics and the impact of the reveal of 'the lost symbol' to the masses.	1
	but i must say, after all the runaround of what now have become the same exact characters and predictable robert langdon/ smart female love interest/ devoted villain/ and supporting cast, the story falls absolutely flat.	1
	i hate to say it, but the last 25% of the book were extremely predictable, had me wishing i would be proven wrong, but i wasn't.	1
	this book delivered what could be the worse ending that i've ever read in my entire life, and with the 'impact' of the release of the 'lost word' all i could say is, so what?!	1
	this book could very well cast dan brown back to his days as an unknown writer with the likes of 'deception point' and 'digital fortress'.	1
	quite possibly the death of robert langdon and his 'insert different conspiracy here' stories.truly disappointing.      	1
	secrets upon secrets.dan brown is an impressive researcher.	1
	reading the lost symbol was educational as well as entertaining.	1
	however, although the personal story moves the book along, i am not satisfied that i know his characters well by the end of the book.	1
	actually, i thought these characters, including the recurring robert, were a bit two-dimensional as they were in the davinci code.	1
	even with a startling twist that occurs in this book, they did not come to life for me.	1
	a little too much telling and not enough showing how they react.	1
	my four stars are based on the interesting revelations about masonry and the passion that drives so many members of the fraternity and the descriptive passages about places we've all heard about.	1
	i can't wait to see the movie.	1
	now that he's taken on the church and masonry, i wonder what's next.      	1
	engrossing, but not without flaws.i know it has become fashionable to review wildly commercially successful novels and slam them with one or two star reviews, and i'll be the first to admit that dan brown's fiction is hardly classic literature, however the simple fact remains:  i lay in bed at night reading his work and i don't want to quit reading.	1
	granted, you might dislike his writing style; the short cliffhanging chapters, the preposterously indestructible and omnipotent villains (present in both angels and demons and the lost symbol), the bizarre leaps in logic and analytical processes that enable our hero (robert langdon, a/k/a tom hanks) to work his way through the maze of symbols and riddles, but again, i have to force myself to quit reading at 2 a.m., when other writing has me nodding off at 11 p.m. as in his two most recent blockbusters, the davinci code and angels and demons, brown takes a subject matter rich in mystery, legend and symbology, and crafts an immensely interesting tale, based partly on fact and largely on logical extension of those facts.	1
	this time, his subject is the brotherhood of masons and their highly secretive beliefs and myths.	1
	as in his two catholicism based predecessors, there will be numerous blogs and articles pointing out the inaccuracies in the lost symbol.	1
	to those, i would say: this is fiction, people, not history (though there is plentiful educational material in all of brown's work).	1
	bottom line, if you enjoyed the davinci code and angels and demons, you will certainly like this novel as well.	1
	it is written on the same template and with the same style as his earlier work.	1
	i'm sure there will come a time (as it did with grisham, clancy and mcmurtry) when the formula will get old, but in my opinion it hasn't happened yet.	1
	i must admit that the final 20-30 pages of religious lecture and mystic spiritualism wore me down somewhat, but the action filled and highly educational preceding 400+ pages more than balance the account.	1
	i am somewhat confused by those who vehemently dislike this novel.	1
	not because there aren't valid criticisms, but instead, why anyone that hated it would have read it in the first place.	1
	after all, virtually everyone that reads this book has read the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	if you hated and despised those two, why would you even read this book?	1
	i suspect many of those slamming this work, secretly enjoyed reading it, but are embarrassed to admit it. 	1
	don't even want to see the movie.i agree with many other reviewers that this book was written as a screenplay, complete with visions of tom hanks.	1
	the writing and editing wouldn't pass college freshman english muster and all those 'ahah' moments were simply annoying.	1
	such a disappointment after brown's last two big sellers.	1
	robert langdon must have lost a few brain cells in that chamber....not to figure out the lost word himself many chapters earlier.	1
	my last word on this story.      	1
	pugmom.	1
	'the lost symbol' is not a follow-up to 'the davinci code'...it is 'the davinci code'.	1
	what a rip-off!!!	1
	can an author plagerize himself??	1
	the whole book is a thinly disguised regurgitation of the davinci book.	1
	the main character again has a woman tagging along, again finds a body part in a public place, again has a crazed zealot chazing him; again has an police figure looking for him...puhlese!!	1
	could dan brown have been any more lazy???	1
	save your money and time.      	1
	drek.i have enjoyed most of dan brown's books at some level, both the digital fortress and the robert langdom ones.	1
	this, however, was the biggest waste of time and money i have endured in ages.	1
	a few of the puzzles were interesting and clever.	1
	but the development was excruciating, the characters actions unreasonable and the payoff both predictable and incredibly anti-climactic.	1
	if there were negative stars, this would receive them.      	1
	good enough for an airplane ride.predictable, clich-characters (even going as far cut-and-pasting silas with minor tweaking), amateurish mentions of technologies(twitter-this, iphone that, google this etc.)	1
	with even less understanding of computers than csi (though i shouldn't have been expecting more from the writer of 'digital fortress').	1
	i understand this novel is for the masses, but there is no reason to dumb it down that much, if people bother to read a book they are not that dumb.	1
	i really felt more like i was reading a screenplay than a novel in places, even going as far as telling us what song is playing in the background in a very unnatural way, almost breaking the flow of the narration.	1
	and seriously, the bible?	1
	trying to get in bed with the catholic church, after antagonizing them with 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code'?still enjoyable, some intrigue even if you can see what's coming a mile away and nice descriptions without becoming too wordy.	1
	still, the overall feeling is that the author had the making of a movie in mind the whole time, and not the writing of a novel.      	1
	not bad, not the davinci code....i loved the beginning of the book.	1
	brown isn't a great writer but he knows how to get his readers turning pages.	1
	but -- the book should have ended earlier -- i think.	1
	i've got about 28 pp to go and very little incentive to finish, now that the solomons are saved, a 'world crisis' has been averted, the denouement of mah'lak has come and gone.	1
	masons?	1
	look, i get that great geniuses were once masons -- but i cannot take seriously men in dress-up enacting little vignettes, no matter how symbolic.	1
	yeah, dan's got that whole 'it was astonishing!'	1
	thing down pat -- god bless him, i think he's probably very happy with life if so much truly amazes and astonishes him.	1
	i'm just not that type.	1
	and really, if the masons are such friggin' geniuses, you'd think by now they'd have included women.	1
	seriously -- how 'enlightened' do you want me to see these men, in their bat caves, with their skulls and toy coffins, practically with a hand painted sign, no girls allowed?	1
	by the end of the book (minus 28 pp), i couldn't be convinced about the importance of the masons, so the whole national security threat angle wasn't working for me.	1
	like we'd be shocked to find out that our leaders are idiots and overgrown frat boys?	1
	i think not.	1
	and while i liked the twist about the son, it's rather hard to believe that zachary wasn't recognized.	1
	even barry bonds is recognizable as barry bonds under all the steroids.	1
	so there was the credulity factor, too.	1
	i loved the research -- well done, blythe!	1
	-- but after a point the repetition was numbing.	1
	noetics was fascinating -- it's too bad they exploded the lab, proofs, history, etc.	1
	and so early at that.	1
	knowing when to end the book would have helped.	1
	peter is saved -- wouldn't it be nice to have that stump attended to at the hospital?	1
	maybe get a shower, spend time with his sister, mourn his dead, then not-dead but worse-than-dead son?	1
	does it make sense to still try to convince us the masons are onto to something by delaying all that and going for a blindfolded tour of dc with an old friend you were only in sporadic touch with...?	1
	i know i'm reading fiction, but, jeez, i think i can see why his son was such a head case.	1
	;)  overall, though, i enjoyed 3/4 of the book thoroughly.        	1
	boring - too much exposition - do yourself a favor and turn away!.this is an example of what happens when a writer gets too famous, and the publishers will publish anything no matter how bad.	1
	while the book takes place over 12 hours, reading it drags on and on.	1
	i read and read page after page, only to realize a handful of minutes have passed in the story.	1
	i checked it out of the library and never finished it.	1
	i found a handful of pages that moved fast followed by dozens of pages that dragged on and on, filled with boring exposition.	1
	when he pulled 1529 ad out of thin air, with logical way of reaching that figure, i put the book down and never picked it up again.	1
	i just noticed that the kindle version has text to speech disabled.	1
	another failure in my opinion.	1
	just shows that dan brown as greedy by refusing to sell a complete kindle version.	1
	text-to-speech is not an audio version, it is a version spoken by a monotone mechanical voice (with no vocal variety or inflection) that makes that book available to the legally blind.	1
	the fact that dan brown and doubleday have chose to disable it, screams discrimination.	1
	however, the blind should feel lucky not suffering through such a boring novel.	1
	publishers have got to learn that to publish junk turns faithful readers into lost customers.	1
	in the past, i would have picked up any book by dan brown.	1
	unfortunately, i'm not looking forward to dan brown's next book.	1
	the lost symbol has turned me into the lost customer for doubleday.  	1
	the best yet if you can handle it.	1
	.	1
	..i think this is his best book yet, because it is not so much a rant against older systems of religious control, but more into the positive message of the mystery school type teachings.	1
	along with, of course, his fame for making it all into a thrilling mystery, which is what turns on alot of people, i guess.	1
	but having been very familiar for a long time with the gnostic, mystery school type teachings and masonic stuff in particular, i thought he did a very good job of 'exposing' their egalitarian, universal 'truths' quite well,  showing why the stuff was 'secret' at one time - because institutions of control loved to 'bash' this stuff with all the reasons he exemplified with examples in the beginning of the book.	1
	also very good at taking you thru existing monuments, buildings and murals in washington d.c. that most people probably never knew existed!!	1
	i'll bet the house of the temple is gearing up for heavier tourist traffic!!	1
	but heavy if you're not interested in ultimate truths!!	1
	!, again unless the mystery of what happens next stuff excites you; i did think the plot of the disenchanted son was psychologically very clever!!!	1
	!      	1
	if you liked his other books....the lost symbol follows the same formula as angels & demons and the da vinci code.	1
	once again, our hero robert langdon finds himself in a difficult predicament that requires him to utilize his knowledge of history and symbology as well as his quick wits.	1
	the pace is not as fast as the other two books (the whole book takes place in one location - washington dc) but the narrative is more believable and requires less suspension of disbelief.	1
	the historical anecdotes and tidbits continue to be quite fascinating and you learn a lot about our nation's capital, our founding fathers, and the free masons.	1
	the payoff is not as shocking or profound as his earlier books, but overall it is a quick and entertaining read.	1
	if you like his other books and don't have unrealistic expectations after the da vinci code, you should enjoy this one as well.      	1
	entertaining at best.entertaining about sums up the feeling i have when thinking of the novel the lost symbol.	1
	robert langdon returns in dan brown's newest thriller with plot twists and turns worthy of his last efforts but somewhat over the top and sophmoric in nature.	1
	a great writer, dan brown, is not.	1
	what dan brown delivers is an intersting plot with short one to two page chapters that will keep you turning to find out what happens.	1
	the current drama involves the freemasons and takes place in washington d.c. which makes the story that much more relevant and current.	1
	interesting facts about the mysterious masons and lost secret mystery schools will keep readers enthralled and reading to the end.	1
	for me this book was about 200 pages too long...as with angels and demons it should have ended midway through and would have had a much greater impact.	1
	at one point i remember thinking 'c'mon already!'	1
	kudo's to mr. brown for his research and one particularly great plot twist that i never saw coming but as far as literay skills go, he remains entertaining at best.       	1
	yet another book in the series....love his research, but irritated by his style of writing... i've developed a method of reading his books where i skim through to find interesting facts and anything important to the storyline (this is entirely subconscious).	1
	might be the publishing effort where editor's say the book must have so much 'filler material', but sometimes i feel like he is insulting his readers by stating the obvious over and over again and telling about every single detail of each scene.	1
	i get the 'show dont tell' aspect of fiction writing, but his writing tends to go a little overboard.	1
	each of his books could be 100-200 pages shorter and still tell the same great story.	1
	otherwise another great book in the series!      	1
	could have been better in 300 pages or so....ok, it would have been hard to just flat-out ignore dan brown's the lost symbol after the da vinci code was so popular.	1
	i wasn't one of the ones who had to read it immediately, so i put myself on the hold list at the library to get it whenever i got to the top.	1
	after finishing the book, my overall reaction is... meh.	1
	it's mildly entertaining, and i was interested to see how it would end.	1
	but it seemed to repeat the same scene formula over and over.	1
	in addition, it could have been at least a third shorter without losing any impact.	1
	the best thing i can i say is that i won't have to see the movie the first weekend it opens... :) brown has another novel here that's similar to da vinci code, only using the masonic legends as the secret sauce.	1
	robert langdon is called by his friend peter solomon to deliver a speech to a group in washington dc.	1
	but when he gets there, he finds the meeting room empty.	1
	a phone call sheds light on the situation... he's been tricked into coming to dc in order to help solve a mystery involving hidden clues in washington that will reveal the ultimate 'hidden word' in masonic lore that will open up the ancient mysteries.	1
	the mystery caller has solomon held hostage so that langdon will deliver.	1
	as clues are uncovered, more and more people get pulled into the action, with the possibility that certain secrets could be revealed that would constitute a national crisis.	1
	so why isn't this a 'must-read'?	1
	obviously with an author of dan brown's stature, you have high expectations.	1
	after da vinci code, he had a high standard to meet.	1
	but it seems as if the hidden secret society genre has been played to extremes lately, and another novel along the same lines doesn't leave much room for new directions.	1
	brown has langdon in a predictable pattern throughout lost symbol.	1
	he's presented with a puzzle, he doesn't know the answer, pressure mounts, and then a revelation occurs.	1
	have something bad happen, and then repeat the series of actions... over and over.	1
	furthermore, it seems like about a third of the book in the middle covers the same ground repeatedly without advancing the story or the revelations much.	1
	as such, the 510 pages could have been done in about 300 with much better results.	1
	it also doesn't help that you're never quite sure where the line between truth and fiction lies in his interpretation and recitation of facts and figures.	1
	are there mystery basements and subbasements under the capitol?	1
	did a number of major historical figures belong to masonic societies?	1
	were structures like the washington monument built with masonic symbols in the design, or is it all just numeric manipulation after the fact?	1
	i don't regret the time spent reading the lost symbol.	1
	i expected mind candy and entertainment, and that's what i got.	1
	i simply think it could have been much better than it actually was.	1
	disclosure: obtained from: library payment: borrowed       	1
	entertaining but far from factual.like davinci and angels et al., this is entertainment not history.	1
	it is even entertaining to make notes of the conflicts with known history, known masonic practice etc.	1
	at least in lost symbol, the monuments, buildings etc.	1
	are, in the main, correctly located.	1
	i think the reason the movie versions of brown's books are popular is they are what the books would be if tightly edited.	1
	this one goes on and on until just when you are ready to abandon hope at the end, you actually find it.	1
	[sorry i couldn't resist] buy the book and read it for the sake of a widow's son.	1
	wear an apron for thansgiving dinner.	1
	assure your fellow celebrants that you have met on the level and depart on the square.	1
	buy a small trowel to butter your english muffins.	1
	get in the spirit of what friday the 13th commemorates!      	1
	the lost writer.this book is a piece of crap and shame on dan brown for subjecting his fans to such innane, ludicrous drivel for over 450 pages.	1
	not only are the characters wooden and devoid of any human qualities, but the story just goes on and on ad naseum about finding god and the ancient mysteries.	1
	brown just keeps repeating the same old cliche's and tries to support it with fancy words and puzzles and geek-speak that leaves the reader feeling they are just reading bits and pieces of a dictionary or encyclopedia.	1
	and brown just keeps piling on the useless scientific and philosophical stuff without regard for the reader's interest in that crap.	1
	and then trying to tie it in to the main story, which is full of holes.	1
	what is it exactly that we are supposed to find at the end of this long, twisted, bloody journey?	1
	mal'akh makes bin laden look like santa clause.	1
	there is no redemption or passion or anything uplifting about this book.	1
	after slogging through 400 pages i was ready to throw it in the trash.	1
	and what the hell is noetics?.	1
	brown needs to go back to college and take creative writing 101. but he's probably laughing all the way to the bank.	1
	i'll never read another one of his books.      	1
	masonic mayhem..how does an author follow up the bestselling novel in history?	1
	apparently by closely copying the formula: deranged obsessed killer, ancient secrets, somewhat cluleless protagonist.	1
	'the lost symbol' finds robert langdon embroiled in yet another mystery involving ancient symbols, only this time the stakes do not seem quite as high.	1
	centered on the masons (who were also featured in 'angels and demons') and their sometimes mysterious world, 'the lost symbol' is an entertaining read, though without the religious overtones and potential earth-shattering secrets of 'the da vinci code' to ground the narrative, this new novel just doesn't seem as important somehow.	1
	the book is also quite violent, with langdon enduring a very graphic waterboarding scene, among other things.	1
	in short, this is a good but not great novel, certainly worth reading but not as buzz-worthy or enduring as da vinci.	1
	good, not great.i read this book and found it to be an easy and quick read.	1
	it has some interesting twists and turns, and certainly adds a bit more mystery to washington dc trips for those visitors looking to follow in landon's footsteps.	1
	my problem was that after reading this book, i picked up the latest pat conroy book, , and found it almost impossible to read.	1
	this means that dan brown's book temporarily turned my brain into mush, as i have read many of conroy's books in the past and found them all to be brilliant.	1
	it's kind of like eating fine french cuisine after over-indulging in some tasty mcdonalds treats -- your body is just not ready for the step up.	1
	i can't blame dan brown for being tasty and a guilty pleasure, but in this case i came away a little bit lesser than i was before and the satisfaction was somewhat abated.	1
	i would still recommend this book if you really thought the davinci code was a good read, and i encourage you to look elsewhere if you are looking for a great read.       	1
	he had me, until the end.book review of 'the lost symbol' by dan brown my brother really enjoys the die hard movies.	1
	i don't bring this up because i think it's his greatest quality.	1
	quite to the contrary, i think it calls into question a lot about his taste.	1
	but it's hard to blame the guy for falling prey to action-packed movies with lots of thing blowing up and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat.	1
	he's not watching the films for something to ponder later.	1
	he's watching them for the immediate gratification of watching bruce willis save the world.	1
	it's the same reason i reach for a dan brown book.	1
	as with his past novels, in 'the lost symbol' places robert langdon in a matter of national, even international, importance.	1
	at the risk of his own life and those of many around him, he must rely on his knowledge of symbology to save the day.	1
	and spoiler alert: he does.	1
	and it's great.	1
	(it's even better if you are home hungover and have time to read about 400 pages in one day.)	1
	i think brown books are like doughnuts for me.	1
	at the mere sight of them i start to salivate and it takes all of my willpower not to just shove one in my mouth.	1
	and when i cave and scarf it down, i love the taste but 30 second later i am unsatisfied and guilty.	1
	brown is consistently writing books that entertain me.	1
	i cannot put the books down and end up leaving dents in whatever chair / couch / bed i park myself on for hours on end.	1
	and almost always he has me until there very end when i close the book and wonder where my time went and acknowledge that the time spent was not worth it.	1
	'the lost symbol' is particularly interesting to me.	1
	it focuses on freemasons and all of the lore surrounding them.	1
	i am used to hearing conspiracies that make the group in question something to be suspicious of.	1
	brown treats the masons with nothing but respect and in his words, they became intriguing and admirable.	1
	i loved the inclusive nature of their organization as it pertained to religion and was impressed that, to the extent that brown's details are accurate, they can reach such a fine balance between religious and social.	1
	and then the end.	1
	i won't include a spoiler alert, but will say that everything i had been working up to and the impression i had of the masons was for not.	1
	and i, the reader, was left unsatisfied and wondering where so many hours had gone.      	1
	great for first 4/5ths of the book...then crash!.most of the books that i read are non-fiction, however, i decided to give the lost symbol a try since i liked the da vinci code.	1
	as my review title suggests, i really enjoyed reading this book for the most part and actually had to find time to read it beyond my normal reading time on mass transit.	1
	i found myself truly intrigued by robert langdon's discoveries and could not wait to see what he turned up next.	1
	i even found myself alternating my jogging route to check out some of the sites mentioned in the book.	1
	that being said, the ending was utterly anti-climactic.	1
	without spoiling it for those that have not read the book, let me just say that it did not work for me.	1
	maybe that is why the symbol has been 'lost' for so many years.        	1
	long winded critics as well as author.i'll keep this short compared to the 'novels' of other reviewers.	1
	i'm no writer but i am an avid reader.	1
	i was #15 on the wait list at our public library (and i'm a board member)for this book.	1
	the anticipation for this read was agonizing.	1
	i loved davinci code and angels & demons so it was my own fault that my expectations were so high.	1
	it was a disappointment.	1
	this book dragged on so long i found myself skipping whole paragraphs in an effort to get through it.	1
	while some passages were interesting (the study of noetic science)much was deadly boring and a waste of paper.	1
	i think (know)dan brown can do better, he has already proven it.	1
	don't let the critics frighten you and don't take everything so seriously.	1
	the first two books were awesome reads because they were not only interesting,but informative and thought provoking with good old fashioned story telling and a hero we could root for.	1
	go back to that formula.	1
	it felt like you had to prove every single thought.....you didn't, you had it right the first time when you wern't afraid of your critics.       	1
	the lackluster blockbuster.not-so-hot on the heels of angels & demons and the da vinci code, dan brown dumps his symbologist hero robert langdon into the washington dc-based, masonic-ritual exposing the lost symbol.	1
	of course, there are plenty of suspenseful... ellipses!	1
	and langdon reacts with over-the-top fear and wonderment to the run-of-the-mill discoveries he makes along the way.	1
	but still, this feels more like a tired hollywood sequel than a committed attempt to rise to new heights.	1
	while the characters, langdon and heroine katherine solomon are frequently puzzled and bewildered, regular thriller readers are likely to be less surprised at how things unfold.	1
	villain mal'akh provides the lunacy and gore.	1
	but the final revelations the lost symbol ultimately uncovers are a huge... letdown.      	1
	not the most stellar effort.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	..i was one of the legions of fans who absolutely loved angels and demons and the da vinci code.	1
	in fact, i recall staying up all night to finish the latter, and being nearly comatose the next day during a conference i was attending.	1
	i was very eager to read the lost symbol, because i liked dan brown's detail and research.	1
	this book though - i don't have much good to say about it.	1
	the pros - once again, dan brown's detail to research is fascinating.	1
	he obviously researched the freemasons, and took a lot of what he learned and turned it into a story.	1
	well, sort of.	1
	i actually like his writing style, too, although some people do criticize it.	1
	his books read in some areas like a textbook, which is the part that i rather like when the topic interests me.	1
	i can see it being a bit dry for the action aficionados.	1
	he brought back a character that i like as well - robert langdon doesn't come off as some muscle-bound clod, but this intellectual-but-can-kick-butt-when-necessary.i do have more to say on this subject, however, later.	1
	the cons - the villain is really, really bad.	1
	he is a caricature lifted out of some cheap straight to dvd slasher flick.	1
	he reminded me of jason from friday the 13th.	1
	sorry, you can't cover a tattoo- especially whole body ones -without a lot of makeup, and that would be so obvious that the only way you could pull it off would be to masquerade as a cross dresser.	1
	the other characters were boring.	1
	peter solomon and his sister or whatever their names were (see - they made such a little impression that i cannot recall a thing) not very well-fleshed out, and once again, just seemed like caricatures.	1
	and robert langdon, despite my fondness for the charcter, also bored me.	1
	and that japanese woman was ridiculous - made me think of those terrible stereotypical cartoons from wwii days.	1
	boring.	1
	the whole plot was just confusing and silly, the editing wasn't very good, though i have to admit that at times i did get distracted by the less than ideal formatting in the kindle edition.	1
	i skipped through whole sections of the book and i don't think that i missed very much.	1
	i can't even remember the end, but i know that it didn't come fast enough.	1
	sounds pretty bad.	1
	it is not a good book.	1
	some people may enjoy it.	1
	i did not.	1
	i would advise borrowing it from a library or some unlucky person like me who actually pre-ordered it.       	1
	pains me to give dan brown low stars.to be honest, i was really excited about this book, like really excited.	1
	not the fact that dan brown writes controversial issues, but that he is an entertaining author.	1
	however this book i was not very entertained by it.	1
	was it a page-turner?	1
	yes, but that's only out of frustration because like some other reviews have said, this book goes no where for most of it!	1
	no one ever bothers to explain anything, and robert langdon is plain annoying.	1
	he wasn't like this in a&d; and da vinci code!	1
	he goes through most of the book rebutting everyone else's statements.	1
	'yes i've heard of it but it's not possible' was probably said once on every page.... until the last one i guess.	1
	the story just became so predictable after a while.	1
	dan brown seemed like he tried way to hard and then fell flat.	1
	anyway, read it if you like to read, don't if you expect something great.	1
	i hope his next book featuring robert langdon will be better.	1
	i mean come on this guy found the holy grail and yet in the lost symbol he didn't believe most of the claims throughout the novel.	1
	ah frustrating read to say the least...       	1
	what a let down.man, what a let down this latest book from dan brown was.	1
	i've been waiting 5 years to be blown away.	1
	but this book is almost a carbon copy of the plot of the davinci code.	1
	you have a hero, a villian and a complex set of puzzles and codes to be broken with a predictable twist at the end.	1
	unless you're interested in a brilliant description of the masons and what they do, i would not recommend this book.	1
	the next five years should be interesting for dan brown.	1
	i hope he can produce something more original next time.      	1
	decent followup to the da vinci code.in his follow-up to the mega-best-selling the da vinci code, dan brown has produced what is essentially a love letter to the masonic order combined with a humanistic new age manifesto, thinly disguised as a genuinely entertaining ticking-clock thriller.	1
	when robert langdon arrives in washington to deliver an address at an awards dinner at the urgent request of his friend and mentor peter solomon, he discovers he has been duped; not only is there no dinner, but peter has been kidnapped, and langdon's presence in the capital is not to deliver a speech but to assist the kidnapper in decoding a series of masonic codes supposedly leading to a cache of hidden wisdom.	1
	as langdon deciphers layer after layer of an increasingly complex code, he must draw upon his vast but incomplete knowledge of masonic lore in hopes of saving his friend's life before it's too late.	1
	working with him are the director of the cia's security office, who insists that what langdon is about to uncover is somehow related to national security, and peter's sister, a beautiful and brilliant noetic scientist on the verge of discovering a tangible link between human thoughts and material reality, including the existence of the soul.	1
	the lost symbol is every bit as readable as the da vinci code while even more intense and possibly more controversial.	1
	the writing is engaging, the characters are rich and well-supplied with interesting back-stories, and the action is practically nonstop.	1
	brown clearly undertook a monumental research project in preparation for writing; readers are inundated with a wealth of information about masons, noetic science, and new age mysticism, though as in brown's previous books the line between fact and fiction is rather blurry at times.	1
	the book takes place almost entirely in washington, d.c., and readers will enjoy experiencing the buildings, symbols, and myths of the u.s. capital from a new perspective.	1
	unsurprisingly, traditional christianity (along with judaism, hinduism , and islam) is portrayed as at best backward and uninformed and at worst downright deceptive.	1
	masons, on the other hand, are the enlightened protectors of sacred knowledge, and those who embrace the concept that god is within us all are on the path to true fulfillment.	1
	brown's treatment of the masonic order is unequivocally positive, although his descriptions of masonic rituals paint them in an undeniably sinister light even as he defends their motives.	1
	the book contains no sexual content and minimal foul language, but the stark evil of the villain along with depictions of ritual sacrifice, bizarre ceremonies, and sadistic torture and murder make the story much darker than either of the two previous books in the series.	1
	the pace lags a bit toward the end as brown lapses into preacher mode, working his characters into a frenzy of pseudo-spiritualism that contributes little other than to make one wish the book had ended a few chapters earlier.	1
	nevertheless, as an example of how to communicate what could have been pedantic and esoteric information in a thoroughly engaging way, the lost symbol succeeds brilliantly.      	1
	about 200 pages too long.as i was on the plane reading this book, i wanted to throw it at someone.	1
	while somewhat interesting, it was too long...and many passages were completely unnecessary.	1
	i just wanted it to end, and thought the ending would be interesting, but it really wasn't.	1
	also the only single interesting plot turn (mal'akh) was so predictable.	1
	i thought dan brown was known for his brilliant writing and keeping you on the edge of each page.	1
	i was at the edge of my limit during this read.	1
	i would not recommend it to anyone.	1
	i was very excited when this came out, but it was quite a let down.	1
	the only reason i give it two stars is because i still love a robert langdon book, and was envisioning tom hanks throughout.        	1
	boring, boring, boring.	1
	if you want to learn about the masons, our founding fathers, and interesting architecture in the nation's capitol, then search the internet or find a nonfiction book dealing with those subjects.	1
	don't bother with dan brown's book.	1
	every time there was any action, dan brown stopped it with detailed information about symbols within our capitol.	1
	the climax was not only predictable, but mr. brown kept on writing.	1
	if his goal was to bore me to tears, he succeeded admirably.	1
	you know a book is not interesting when you only have five pages left to read but go to sleep anyway.	1
	i was never so happy to finish a book.      	1
	been there; done that!.while i admire mr. brown's creativity and clearly planned method of writing, i am quite tired of the repetitive nature of his story lines.	1
	mr. brown seems to have become too comfortable with this subject matter by being repetitive, dragged out with the philosophical ideas of the 'masonic' world.	1
	if you've never read his previous books on the subject matter, this may be interesting and enlightening to you.	1
	if however you are up to beat with his previous novels on the subject of free masons, then be prepared to be disappointed, maybe even fed up for the last few chapters of this book.	1
	hope they don't turn this into a movie, or maybe if they do it won't disappoint as much as the book.	1
	having said that, i may very well read his next release if it's not about the masonic culture.	1
	he is eloquent and thoughtful in his art; does gads of research and really gets into his story.       	1
	disappointed.while it was just barely an ok read i felt disappointed.	1
	once i found out what they were looking for i knew exactly where they were going to end up.	1
	then the book became just a question 'how are they going to get there?'	1
	i could not believe that langdon could not guess it right away.	1
	also, the italic inner thoughts were annoying and the final chapter almost made me put the book down unfinished...      	1
	i started skipping pages .	1
	.	1
	..you should skip them all.	1
	there are about 200 pages of story, the rest is moralistic droning.	1
	i started skipping the sermons and paging forward to where the story resumed.	1
	what's worse, the plot twists are so obvious they were a little insulting.	1
	wait for the movie, i'm sure they'll be able to stretch out the story to fill two hours - if there are a lot of credits.      	1
	barely brown.long ago, dan brown published a book called digital fortress.	1
	i read it after having enjoyed davinci code.	1
	that book was a real stinker.	1
	dan has now created another real stinker in the lost symbol.	1
	hardly the adventure for fans of brown, this was a tedious read for most of the 500 pages.	1
	while all of his writing and characters are fairly simple, the stories and plots can grab you.	1
	i was totally absorbed by deception point, davinci code and angels&demons.	1
	; this new book is, unfortunately, not on par with those three.      	1
	robert really disappointed me.boring, not so many interesting facts to base this new novel on but instead it revolves around the same few ones over and over againg (they are just worded on different ways many times).	1
	and robert langdom is not longer the smart, clever and eager-to-solve-puzzles kind of hero he used to be, as a matter of fact he seems more concern on doubting himself than on providing answers letting others play his roll.	1
	definetely a good read for the weekend if you do not expect d. brown to top angels and demons or the davinci code with this one.	1
	it will take the author more research and a more dynamic story line to come up with a better book.      	1
	filled with intrigue and suspense..	1
	contender for top 5 worst books i've read.annoying characters and absolutely no suspension of disbelief.	1
	packed with references to symbols and origins of words but lacking in quality of plot.	1
	unlike his previous books you don't 'get in to' the story hence you are constantly thinking that plot elements are unrealistic and/or ridiculous.	1
	definitely not as good as da vinci code or angels & demons.	1
	a bit of a let down.....i'll spare you the critique of brown's writing style that many other reviewer's are offering because i'm no expert.	1
	i will, however, tell you what i thought of the story.	1
	if, like me, you enjoyed the da vinci code and angels and demons, you probably won't like this one as well.	1
	brown's previous two novels featuring the robert langdon character immediately pulled me in and kept me turning pages until i had finished.	1
	they also both pulled off some shocking twists and dramatic endings.	1
	the lost symbol, on the other hand, is at times boring, but there was still enough there to keep me reading.	1
	the ending is where i felt really let down.	1
	i felt like chapters 123 through the epilogue could almost have been wholly eliminated.	1
	the author attempts to tie up some loose ends, but he does it in such an unsatisfying and strained way that i almost wish i had simply closed the book at the end of chapter 122.  i wish i could elaborate more, but i don't want to spoil the ending for anyone.	1
	also, if i never see the word 'esoteric' again, i'll be ok with that.	1
	i think it must have appeared in this novel in excess of 100 times.	1
	there are other repetitions in the novel that annoyed me a little as i read, but other reviewers have covered them thoroughly.	1
	bottom line: pick it up at the library, but don't buy it.	1
	i doubt you will find yourself wanting to read through it again.      	1
	ridiculous nonsense.i was going to give this book a two star rating, but i just can't do it, it doesn't deserve one star.	1
	let me first say that i did like the davinci code, it was a page-turner with a gripping and only moderately absurd plot.	1
	the lost symbol is just ridiculous.	1
	typical dan brown formula, super-menacing bad guy, overly-elaborate yet mildly entertaining puzzles and every turn in the plot has 'earth shattering' consequences.	1
	it feels like dan brown cranked this out just so they could make a movie out of it, and a bad movie at that.	1
	one final observation, the last few chapters are awful.	1
	all of the preposterous buildup fizzles away into bitter frustration.	1
	i think i am done with dan brown, just terrible.         	1
	a good read, as usual.dan brown is always a good read.	1
	i had trouble putting this one down.	1
	i found one inconsistency and it was a little preachy at the end, but great character development and exciting action.	1
	the book imparted interesting information--technical, scientific, masonic, and d.c. architectural detail.	1
	i particularly like brown because you can read him for the action and the 'pretend information', but also for a heap of reliable 'real' information.	1
	for those reasons, both dan brown and daniel silva are among my favorite authors.      	1
	enthralling but getting old.i still enjoy brown's writing style, but his books are starting to get old.	1
	i wonder if he should drop the langdon character and go another direction.	1
	the newness has just worn off.	1
	i did get enthralled with reading this book and it kept my attention until the ending kept getting drawn out.	1
	i expected the book to be over multiple times, but no, it just kept going on and on.        	1
	disappointed.i was more than a little disappointed in this book.	1
	based upon his prior works i expected at the least an interesting story that moved along at a good clip.	1
	such was not the case.	1
	it seemed that half the book was taken up with other people explaining to dr. langdon what he didn't understand.	1
	it took forever to get through the last 25 or 30 pages.	1
	it will either be the shortest movie made next year, or the most boring.      	1
	a good story, but another let-down ending..i listened to the audio book version, which was reasonably well done.	1
	(except for some pretty obvious audio inserts.)	1
	one thing let me down more than anything in davinci code.	1
	the lost symbol's plot builds on a lie.	1
	maybe this is one of those 'what do you mean by 'is' situations' where the wording is circumspect enought to let the lie be glossed over.	1
	as the climax was reached, i was angry to find that the villain's origin was based on deception.	1
	i really had the wind knocked out of me, thinking...how does brown get away with this.	1
	sure the story kept my interest, but now i find i was treated like a chump.	1
	like davinci code, the ending is totally unsatisfying.	1
	ten or more chapters of rambling esoterica that could have been condensed into a few summarizing paragraphs.	1
	the book could have ended with the fate of the protagonist.	1
	using 'dead' commute time to listen to the book was enjoyable.	1
	i would have been immensly upset to have invested so much reading time in lost symbol to have had the tables turned on me as they were.      	1
	too bad this wasn't the lost book!.i can't add much to the literary critique, especially justin lee's very nice review that kicks off all of the reviews for this book.	1
	all i can say is this: i bought the book a few days after it was released.	1
	i read, maybe, the first three chapters.	1
	i couldn't read any more and i traded it in to a local book store that buys used books.	1
	dan brown's writing style grates on me.	1
	his italicized sentences indicating what characters are thinking and feeling get in the way.	1
	plus, the writing is just so bland.	1
	his descriptions of people and places lack precision and vividness.	1
	here's an example: 'langdon turned the corner and spotted a tall man wearing an over-sized black hat.'	1
	that line doesn't appear in the book, as far as i know.	1
	but it's indicative of the kind of vague description i slogged through.	1
	how tall?	1
	what kind of man?	1
	what kind of hat?	1
	what do you mean over-sized?	1
	many of my favorite writers (john d. macdonald, lawrence block, ray bradbury) would have described that man down to the number of hairs in each nostril - but do so in an entertaining, engaging way.	1
	dan brown is very good at weaving technology -- and pseudo-histories -- throughout his books.	1
	at that, he is one of the best.	1
	but he lacks the literary talent to write vividly and compellingly.	1
	true, i turn pages when i read his books.	1
	but often just to get to the point, usually an inevitable point i know is coming anyway.	1
	so get to it, already!	1
	life is too short, and there are way too many brilliant books in the world, to read a dan brown novel.	1
	i thought the da vinci code was great.	1
	not because of its literary style but because it was a gripping story.	1
	with the lost symbol, i just didn't care -- not about langdon, not about the codes and labyrinthine mysteries and secret societies, not about the resolution to the whole mess.	1
	i just couldn't get into it.	1
	speaking of the secret societies, the opening chapter of the lost symbol made me laugh.	1
	the heavy-handed inner dialogue was akin to mustache-twisting in villains in the era of silent movies.	1
	something like this (in italics): 'little do they know i mean to do them harm.	1
	the fools!	1
	ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!'	1
	i'm sure the lost code will become another movie (hopefully better than the last one, which was dreadful!)	1
	quicker than you can say back-a-dump-truck-full-of-money-up-to-my-house.	1
	but it's not likely to be a movie i'll ever see, just as this won't be a book i ever pick up again.	1
	forget lost symbols.	1
	i wish dan brown had lost the manuscript to this book before it reached the publisher!      	1
	short review.this review is for all of you familiar with dan brown and his character robert langdon.	1
	the lost symbol is written in much the same way as the prior novels.	1
	langdon is pulled into a plot by the protagonist who plans to wreak havoc on the world.	1
	of course langdon saves the day.	1
	the story starts slow and it isn't until around page 150 that events start to pick up.	1
	but once they do it doesn't slow from there.	1
	there are a few tight spots where you cant believe what you've read, but brown gives his readers and (the majority of his)characters what they want.	1
	although not as packed with symbolism as the two prior novels, this was an interesting and enthralling story.	1
	i recommend it to anyone who enjoys dan brown.	1
	happy reading!      	1
	dan brown lost symbol.i have to admit i am a big fan of dan brown and have read every one of his books to date.	1
	davinci code is without doubt, his very best, however each of his books had me reading and not wanting to leave them down.my wife and i had to do a trip from ca to wa to be there for the birth of our new twin boys, and i knew i was going to have longish periods of free time, so i bought the lost symbol and took it with me.	1
	boy, am i glad i did.	1
	i have to disagree with some of the other 'analytical' reviews breaking the book up in to sections.	1
	damn it, it is an entertaining fiction novel and i bought it for the sheer entertainment and enjoyment factor.i loved every chapter, short ones and long ones.	1
	i had myself googling washington dc to look at the city map to familiarize me with the places mentioned and get a feel for the story.i was at the edge of my seat with this book and each time i had to close it because we needed to be grandparents, i was frustrated and couldn't wait to get back.	1
	i loved the plot and also the unbelievable twist towards the end (won't reveal it here), but it was a nice, but sad turn of events.unexpected.as for the noetic science, although it was mentioned and explained, i was so curious, i wished dan would have actually given us a hands on samping of this science.	1
	perhaps this leaves the door open for the next book, to somehow bring this science in to the tale.if you enjoy a good gripping story with plenty of twists and turns, the lost symbol is highly recommended by me.	1
	good reading.      	1
	strangely implausible.this book contains some interesting facts which, i'm certain, took some digging to gather and imagination to even look for.	1
	aside from this being eerily similar to the da vinci code in its plot and style the ending is highly implausible in that, within a 10 hour span, among the three main characters, each had significant trauma but within an hour or two they were calmly strolling around appreciating architectural features, enjoying a sunrise and sharing philosophy.	1
	i think a more normal reaction would have been: holy crap!	1
	get me to a hospital!	1
	this is not dan brown's best effort or even close.	1
	it's quickly paced but predictable.      	1
	the lost symbol.i just finished this book.	1
	i really liked it.	1
	was it a 'can't put it down' page-turner like angels & demons and da vinci code were?	1
	no.	1
	but i am interested in the masons, always love a good conspiracy theory and liked the message at the end.	1
	it did seem to me it was pre-packaged for a movie but who can blame him?	1
	it was an easy, fun read that i would recommend, especially to anyone who already liked dan brown's previous books.	1
	i find the reviews about him being a bad writer ridiculous.	1
	i don't recall reading anywhere that he was comparing himself to twain or shakespeare.	1
	he writes fun, thrilling books.	1
	have a little fun people.	1
	lighten up.      	1
	another book, same old robert langdon.the lost symbol, continues the story of famed symbologist, robert langdon.	1
	the lovable protagonist is called in again, shrouded in mystery, to help solve one of the longest running myths in american history, and come to the rescue of his long-time mentor.	1
	it would make one wonder, why he would even answer his phone!	1
	steeped in 'suspense,' the reader is lead from the improbable to the impossible, and back again.	1
	this journey starts like many of the robert langdon novels.	1
	he is swimming.	1
	he is contacted by a strange man, with a crazy mission.	1
	he joins the crazy mission.	1
	he almost dies, somehow doesn't, and finally becomes a hero.	1
	purely formulaic.	1
	with that critique out of the way, we can look at some positives.	1
	this book is addictive at times.	1
	once you get into the story it's really hard to put it down.	1
	brown continues to write in an authoritative manner, which makes you believe he honestly knows what he's talking about.	1
	that, i think, is the secret for his success, and is his biggest weakness.	1
	the only other complaint i have about this book, is the ending.	1
	it goes on 40 pages longer than it should.	1
	by the time he reaches page 509, you wish you had something better to occupy your time.	1
	it's not his endless psycho-babble that ruins it, but it's the fact that dan brown has a serious case of diarrhea of the keys.	1
	he has a tendency to use 100 words when 10 would suffice.	1
	i know i've been hard on this book; however, it was an enjoyable read.	1
	the story itself is very good, and has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.	1
	if you can get past the inaccuracies, and the tedious descriptions you could enjoy this read.      	1
	not his best.this is not dan brown's best work.	1
	if the only book you have read by him is the davinci code, then don't read this one.	1
	you will be very disappointed.	1
	dan gets too bogged down in details of washington dc, and the masonic order itself, that the reader finds himself glossing over much of it.	1
	i personally didn't care what happened to the characters.	1
	the story was too formulaic in it's writing, and appeared to be written with the intent of turning it into a movie.	1
	like what happened to the ludlum books, brown has become far too predictable for the reader.      	1
	extremely boring.	1
	it is a bad book.i disagree with the first two reviewers; this is a bad book.	1
	the characters aren't fully realized, the plotting is bumpy and dull, the scenery could be wonderful- washington, d.c. is a beautiful and vibrant city- but it's dull and narrowed.	1
	if you don't know who robert langdon is before you read this book, you won't know when you're finished either.	1
	this read, to me, like the screenplay for the movie the author knows will be made and so he will let the director tell the story.	1
	it also reads like an apology to the church as well as to masons for any dismay he may have caused them from past books.	1
	it really is a bad book.      	1
	very good but.the book is an other dan brown classic.	1
	i read it in 2 days; the thrill and surprises were very satisfactory.	1
	after paris, london and rome now we learned a lot about washington dc's history and monuments.	1
	book push me to do a lot of research on internet about neotic science.if i compare this book with in the da vinci code and angels & demons;  i believe the author achieved  have much better and detailed character descriptions which made them more real and more believable.	1
	i felt he became a much better and confident in writing.	1
	however i have a few negative comments; what is it about turkish prison story?	1
	that was true 20 years ago, please, have you check how turkey is today?	1
	may not be 100% developed and g8 country but do not have such prisons any more, not since early 90s.	1
	please do not trash a country without checking the facts, not in a book which sells millions all over world that brings a responsibility.	1
	the philosophical discussions after the trill was over, about one true god and lost word being the bible, etc.	1
	was much too long.	1
	even though i agree 100% with the ideas and facts stated i got bored on some of the pages.	1
	finally; i have read all dan brown novels, i am still a big fan.	1
	i will buy when ever he will write a new book but still my favorite is  angels & demons.	1
	lost symbol was not able to change that	1
	dan brown, i have some bad news for you..i was as excited as the next guy for this book, and put other books aside to read it.	1
	bad move.	1
	i haven't taken the time (and won't) to really analyze why i feel this way, but the truth is that i got about 100 pages in, to the place where the hand on a spike shows up, and couldn't take any more.	1
	the story plodded along, and it just wasn't the page turner i wanted (it's 2am, then 3am, then 4am and you're still reading and you know you have to get up at 7).	1
	the evil tattooed assassin was just too weird, and his brand of violence came through as needless and gratuitous.	1
	there's probably people in this world who are just this weird, but i don't want to know about them.	1
	when the hand appeared, i said, 'enough!'	1
	and put the book down.	1
	i wasn't grossed out; the story was just too weird.	1
	my wife read it next, and although she finished it, she didn't think that i had sold the book short.	1
	one star, and only because i can't give zero stars.	1
	dan brown, you have just lost this reader.	1
	this book is a real stinker!      	1
	let down - read a good cussler instead.absolutely loved angels & demons and davinci code....not this one.	1
	noetics.....a craptacular pseudo-science about as relevant as scientology.	1
	no one that has even a marginal education would take this seriously.....not because they are overly skeptical, but because they are intelligent.	1
	basically, guessed where the big secret was hidden about two-hundred pages before it was revealed.	1
	so it was simply a matter of reading through pages to get there.	1
	agree with above comments that langdon turned into a moron, offering virtually nothing to help solve the mystery.	1
	the bad 'enlightenment' phrases that go something like: 'actually, most respected leaders of the field have known this for years....yada yada' which ends with some absurd notion that noetics isn't total garbarge and instead has a massive following of brilliant scientists.	1
	the end truth that is revealed is what exactly?	1
	some crap that everyone already knows?	1
	really?	1
	if that is what is buried, what is the point of the secrecy and the ridiculously complex codes hiding the 'secret' that isn't really a secret at all.	1
	why hide that at all?	1
	so boils down too......what was the point of all this?      	1
	enjoyable.....i enjoyed the book, took me a day to read it but honestly i did skip a few pages as they added nothing to the plot or the characters.	1
	i did think dan brown was writing a screen play and i went along with him and pictured tom hanks walking through the story and that helped.	1
	i found myself also thinking of nicholas cage in national treasure as i was reading it as well.	1
	(sorry)  i did not understand noetic science but that was explained ad nauseum by the end of the book.	1
	but it is a good read though not worth the hardback price, i will wait for paperback version of any new book.	1
	overall i enjoyed the book simply because it was an interesting concept......      	1
	wow!!	1
	great page turner!.i bought this latest dan brown book for my kindle, planning on saving it to read on an upcoming trip.	1
	well i made it a whole two weeks before i brought down and started reading the book.	1
	and once i started i couldn't put it down.	1
	the detail and storyline sucked me right in.	1
	i know that many of his books get plenty of attention and the entire plot and details are broken down and examined by professional to determine the 'truth', and i have one thing to say about that.....it's fiction, with enough truth thrown in to make it believable.	1
	why do you think he is such a popular author....it's because you want to believe the story he is telling.	1
	just sit back and enjoy the ride.	1
	and what a ride this story was.	1
	buy it and share with your friends!      	1
	a screen play pretending to be a novel.this book has too many words -- way too many words.	1
	it is clear from the outset that this was written to be a screen play and each of the chapters was intended to be 'shot'.	1
	but i did read the book in its entirety so i gave it three stars.	1
	i read brown's 'the da vinci code' and really enjoyed it even though it was clear the heavy lifting had been done in the book 'holy blood holy grail'.	1
	brown followed that up with 'angels and demons' which seemed to be based on tour guides of rome and vatican city.	1
	that book actually expected the reader to believe that langdon could zip around rome in minutes.	1
	anyone who has ever been in rome and seen the traffic knows how ridiculous that is, but it is a work of fiction.	1
	not as good as da vinci code but still enjoyable and now we have 'the lost symbol' which seems to have been based on a discovery channel documentary with an eye on the next movie that is sure to result.	1
	so what about this novel pretending to be something other than a screen play?	1
	this has langdon zipping around washington d.c but unlike his previous outings where he was a major leader of the mystery, in this book his role seems to be that of a confused bystander watching events unfold around him.	1
	his major contribution seems to be to explain the latest 'symbol' while stating with a sense of discovery 'but that's a myth' followed by 'i am only interested in peter solomon'.	1
	he is then whisked by events -- usually out of his control -- to the next symbol, while being out smarted at every turn by the antagonist.	1
	brown does spice up the plot with what he hopes are a couple of red herrings which will certainly play well in the movie.	1
	but there are whole sections here that add little to the plot and the chapters are burdened with unnecessary descriptions of the geography and masonic practice and belief.	1
	i bought the book.	1
	i read the book.	1
	i will probably see the movie.	1
	but brown will have to do better in his next book.	1
	maybe he should take on sasquatch, ufo's, or captain kidd's treasure, i'm sure the discovery channel has something that he can use for a plot.      	1
	lost respect.the book is barely ok. my rating is 2.15 stars.	1
	after an interesting start, the good guys all went stupid in terms of decisions and priorities.	1
	i almost found myself cheering for the dark side.	1
	after a fair amount of misdirection, the ending sort of fell apart.	1
	over the course of reading several brown books, it is apparent that misdirection and weak endings are taking over his work.	1
	as long as people keep buying, i predict that his next effort will have a very manipulative body and a frayed tail.      	1
	loses steam toward the end....i enjoy dan brown's books.	1
	they're full of interesting historical facts, although sometimes i wonder which facts are real and which are fiction.	1
	but, it does inspire me to learn more about things that he writes about.	1
	this book starts out very good and builds to a climax about three-quarters of the way through it.	1
	but then it just settles back down, and the rest of the book seems to bog down with drawn-out conversations, and never builds to what i consider a satisfying end.	1
	this book was okay, but my very favorite book of mr. brown's is angels and demons, followed closely by deception point.      	1
	the lost symbol.although the story line is a little repetitious and similar to angels and demons and the davinci code, i enjoyed reading much of the research that dan brown does before he writes a book.	1
	of his five books, i enjoyed angels and demons the most, followed by the davinci code and then the lost symbol.	1
	having been fortunate enough to visit many of the sites mentioned in his novels, it makes the story line much more interesting to read.	1
	like most of his books, they should be re-read, so that some of the finer points which may have been missed the first time are enjoyed in the second reading.	1
	i found that when the 'bad guy' in the lost symbol when finally revealed was not as surprising as some of the other books.      	1
	how would you end 'the lost symbol?	1
	'.in defense of dan brown, can anyone out there think of a plausible ending for 'the lost symbol'?	1
	what could the secret of the masons possibly be, hidden somewhere in washington?	1
	after all, we have already found the holy grail, and indiana jones located the ark of the covenant.	1
	the only problem i had with the book was the apparent family trait of the solomon family to endure unendurable amounts of pain.	1
	creating your own tattoos is one thing, but removing one's own testicles is quite another.	1
	surviving a home hand amputation sounds like civil war medicine at its worst, and yet peter solomon is remarkably good humored after a few days.	1
	of course, langdon is fine minutes past his own experience; clearly people in brown's universe are tough customers.	1
	i really enjoyed all the research and information on the history of the masons, although much of it has been used before in things like 'national treasure.'	1
	could another author have pitched a story line so similar to 'national treasure'?      	1
	the symbol dan brown was seeking is found.	1
	$.dan brown can write a good book.	1
	he has proven this thrice now.	1
	after two weak early efforts, he came back with a vengeance with angels and demons.	1
	the da vinci code followed and caught the public's imagination.	1
	i thought the code was a lesser book than angels, but both were very good reads.	1
	symbol again shows a lesser effort.	1
	brown has found his audience, and they should be pleased with his latest work.	1
	it has the imagery and faux historical provenance that made da vinci code so readable.	1
	accept this as mind candy and you will enjoy the read.        	1
	if you loved 'da vinci code', you'll enjoy 'lost symbol'.overall: it's an entertaining repeat of the 'da vinci code' formula.	1
	pros:- fast paced, thriller- educational- entertaining cons:- like da vinci code, dan brown blends fact and fiction, which can be dangerous because some readers might believe everything they read.- it's a predictable repeat of the da vinci code in almost every way.	1
	conclusion: unlike some people, i read brown's books with modest expectations.	1
	i read them for entertainment.	1
	i hope it will be a page turner, but i don't expect it to be a classic in english literature.	1
	if you have such expectations, then you'll probably enjoy this book.      	1
	more of a reference book.i loved dan brown's da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	the ancient symbol lore was nicely intertwined with compelling story lines.	1
	i am somewhat disappointed with the lost symbol as it is more of a reference guide to the varied mystical symbols placed in and around washington d.c.  the story line is very thin and only tangent to the lengthy explanations of the many symbols mr. brown researched.	1
	although probably not as profitable, the book could easily be turned into a tour guide and the story would not have been missed.	1
	in fact, in the last few chapters, you would never know that the main characters have had bodily traumas as they calmly walked and ran around the city looking for the answers that, apparently, were right in front of our eyes if we only looked, maybe with a microscope!	1
	sorry, not one of my favorite books this year.      	1
	not that bad.for the genre it's a good book, not great but good.	1
	i totally agree that the davinci code is almost impossible to match.	1
	not to repeat others points of view...the problem i had was that it seemed the entire book was written, hopefully, for a movie script.	1
	it would make a pretty good movie.	1
	maybe better than angels and demons which was lackluster.	1
	the book plods along in places and the some of the scenarios are so impossible that you have to wonder.	1
	what i totally admire is the research that goes into his books.	1
	very interesting.	1
	but research doesn't always lead to a really great book.        	1
	another fast paced brown novel.the premise of the lost symbol starts sounding very familiar.	1
	it's almost formulaic.	1
	the evil character, the frantic race to find some hidden object.	1
	it's all dan brown's style.	1
	it is a page turner with lots of factoids thrown in that kept me going to google to check out.	1
	hopefully it will do for washington d.c. what the da vinci code did for paris, and angels and  deamons did for rome.	1
	it was a fun read up to the last portion that read like a dreary epilogue that was simplistic and preachy.	1
	i would have been happy to have dropped that portion altogether.      	1
	you're all too hard on this book!.i am an avid reader of all types of literature.	1
	screw literary commentary, this book kept me turning the pages.	1
	there are some very surprising plot twists and times when i'm thinking 'oh, no!	1
	x can't happen to him/her!	1
	noo!'	1
	it's rare a book keeps me engaged to the level that dan brown does.	1
	i often think that because of the hype of davinci, regardless of what he does it 'won't be good enough.'	1
	listen to me- get the book and decide for yourself.	1
	i've loaned it to a couple of friends and nobody has taken more than four days to return it- with the whole thing read!	1
	i'd say it's definitely worth your time.       	1
	about as good as brown will do following da vinci and demons.my title pretty much sums up my review.	1
	dan brown continues on his page-turning, multiple twist, sprint to the finish line form.	1
	the book is fun and served it's purpose.	1
	but if you're expecting to be blown away like you were with his previous two pieces, i advise you take a step or two back.	1
	the riddles and mysteries surrounding the 'objects' langdon has in his possession keep this book from deeply falling into the realm of pure science fiction.	1
	though i must admit, i feared this book would spin out of control at the end, but brown did a good job bringing it together for a semi-realistic and unforgettable ending through a very spooky villain and his fully unveiled plans.	1
	my other huge problem with the book, and this is a slight spoiler so beware, the book climaxes 40 pages before the actual end.        	1
	writers ego got the best of him.i really enjoyed both of browns previous books.	1
	he really had no where to do but down, but i'm shocked this book got by both him and his editor in its present format.	1
	i literally felt like he was sitting at my shoulder pointing out different parts of the books and saying 'see how smart i am, i know all about this?'.	1
	the problem is so much of the detail was irrelevant to the story.	1
	the story would be going along fine and at a tense moment and several characters would stop and debate ancient greek mythology (while a cia team is chasing them of course).	1
	brown obviously takes himself a bit too seriously and his editor must be clueless to let this book to market in its current form.	1
	the story itself was interesting, but it would virtually stop time and again while the characters lectured each other of inane factoids.	1
	yes, i get it, the book is about uncovering ancient secrets, but i would bet half the pages are about things that have nothing to do with the story and are more for brown to show us how much of a genius he is to write about it.	1
	its a shame.	1
	davinci code was excellent and no way was brown going to match it.	1
	the expectations were too high.	1
	but, i am very surprised that this was his best shot.	1
	it was mildly entertaining, but everytime i started to get into it, they went off on another six page discourse on x and y.      	1
	awful, awful, awful.it is hard to believe that a book with so much hype can be so bad.	1
	the plot starts with a repeat of the davinci code - robert langdon running around with an attractive female, solving unintelligible puzzles that make no sense whle being 'chased' by a bad guy - the big difference is that he is bald instead of albino.	1
	now that is the good news - the bad news is that there is a plethora of 'who cares' stuff constantly being brought up regarding the masons and the search for 'truth'.	1
	along the way there's gobbly-gook about noetic science that is incomprehensible.	1
	all of this would be tolerable but the actions of the usg agents makes no sense which allows langdon and then the bad guy to escape again and again.	1
	the final scene (which is actually 30 pages before the ending of the book) where the bad guy meets his end is just downright silly and the world is saved as an afterthought.	1
	the 30 page epilogue is a sermon on truth, justice and the american way.	1
	i just can't wait for the movie!!!	1
	on the positive side, there's no way it can be worse than the book.      	1
	lost symbol.i agree with those who have said the da vinci code is a nearly impossible act to follow.	1
	the lost symbol is a good mystery book with more than enough suspense and intrigue.	1
	some think the material is repetitive, but the problem may be that brown is just not giving himself enough time to devote to his next project because he still wants to hurry up and maximize on the success of the davinci.      	1
	felt like he tried too hard.i thought this book was okay....just okay.as someone who loved 'the davinci code' and loved 'angels and demons' even more, i was a little let down by 'the lost symbol'.	1
	first off, it is very long for a story that only spanned 1 day.	1
	there were several times in the book that i was almost speed reading to get past slow parts simply because the book was so long.	1
	to me, i think mr. brown tried too hard on the story line.	1
	after having the cool plots and twists in the first two langdon books, it felt like mr. brown was trying to do it again, but more this time.	1
	it kept going to the point of it being ridiculous at times.	1
	i think the actual story was very neat, but he just took it to the nth degree and should have kept it more simple....in my humble opinion.	1
	for dan brown fans, like i am, it is definitely worth reading, but it surely isn't worth $20+(hardback).	1
	the people who got it on their kindle for $10 paid what this book was worth.	1
	i would have been happy if it was 75 pages shorter.	1
	i don't mind long books at all, but this was too long for the story it told.	1
	i will definitely read more langdon novels, but i hope next time around, mr. brown doesn't try so hard.....or wait to long to write it.      	1
	more of the same.i was really looking forward to this latest from dan brown.	1
	although i thorough enjoyed 'the davinci code' with it's italian setting and catholic church theme, 'angels and demons' was also a provocative read.	1
	i found 'the lost symbol' to be much the same as 'davinci' substituting washington d.c. for italy and the masons for the church.	1
	only this time, the newness is gone and there is much less suspense; the intrigue doesn't seem quite as intriguing.	1
	i found myself less invested in the characters.	1
	no longer the answer man, robert langdon takes a backseat to katherine and peter solomon, and director sato.	1
	should the langdon series continued, i may be less compelled to read the next one.      	1
	same old story.i shall be fair with dan brown.	1
	outperforming his da vinci code is something he will never achieve.	1
	the code was original, smart, hit hard on the catholic church (i am catholic myself but took the book as not serious) and generated such a polemic that made the book known worldwide and a difficult benchmark for himself.	1
	i then read angels & demons which i also found a more interesting plot than the code and even more considering that it was written before.	1
	nevertheless, and in the full awareness of the above, when i started reading the lost symbol i felt like i was reading any of the other two plots:  langdon being contacted in boston, being flown to a new destination, meeting a girl in dispair, a mentally deformed and & physically handicapped foe, etc.	1
	etc.	1
	what's new?	1
	has brown lost his own originality? 	1
	give me back the anti-religious dan brown.in his earlier da vinci and demons novels, dan brown's disdain for religion, christianity in particular, at least motivated him to a good yarn with genuinely creepy villains operating from organized systems threatened by secret truth.	1
	'lost symbol' ends up with a 10 chapter apology for new age optimism about the value of truth, even though the book's main threat to world civilization is that a few important people might get embarrassed by having the truth revealed.	1
	it's shabby work, full of cardinal violations of a good thriller -- many of the clues are just downright false.	1
	the author intentionally leads the reader away from accurate suspicion, ending with a 'gotcha' that holds up only because the clues along the way turn out to be fraudulent.	1
	at least the animosity of brown to the roman catholic church made for good antagonists.	1
	here the antagonists are all parties brown will defend in the end, and his ability to put real vitriol into their actions isn't there.	1
	imagine jason bourne singing kum ba yah with the cia chiefs at the end of the trilogy and you get the confusion that brown is at the heart of brown's poor effort in this novel.	1
	there was a point where robert langdon could have died.	1
	brown should have taken the risk and ended this series with something worth remembering.        	1
	too predictable!.alright.	1
	i just finished the book and it definitely wasn't worth all the hype nor the wait.	1
	it had it's moments but he seems to be trying too hard to keep the same 'langdon' formula going.	1
	i felt like he was adding extra historical information just to stretch it out in certain passages.	1
	a little more than half way through, it started to become too predictable.	1
	it got my attention in certain areas but it got to be long winded at times.	1
	i read another review that said 'it got to be too preachy'.	1
	couldn't agree more.	1
	just tell the damn story!	1
	it was a bit of a let down and the ending was one of the most anti-climatic i've ever read.	1
	really.	1
	a quick review.amazon currently has over a thousand reviews of the lost symbol, so there is really not much else to say.	1
	just a few key points.	1
	1. if you enjoyed angels and demons and the da vinci code, you will probably want to read this one.	1
	lots of similarities in plot, pacing, and characters.	1
	too much historical background at times.2.	1
	professor langdon again shows amazing intellect and memory.3.	1
	bad guy very reminiscent of the albino monk in the da vinci code4.	1
	symbols, clues, puzzles, and a race against time.	1
	much religion and philosophy.5.	1
	freemasons won't be happy, but the d.c. tourist bureau will love the book.	1
	people will be going all over the city saying 'oh, look.	1
	that's in the book.'6.	1
	a true page-turner.	1
	you'll want to see what happens next.	1
	so bad i couldn't finish.really nothing new to add to the torrent of negative reviews - except that its even worse than '1 star' can indicate.	1
	simply awful.	1
	unreadable and hard to believe that the same author who wrote so many enjoyable novels could produce this mess.	1
	i'm absolutely astonished.	1
	i rarely but a book down and it was a battle to get even half way through.	1
	avoid avoid avoid      	1
	an enjoyable read..what i liked: - there are some passages which are i-can't-put-this-down exciting.- the history behind certain words and symbols.- the short chapters which make this an easy when-i-can-fit-it-in read.- the science vs. religion theme.	1
	what i didn't like: - i was able to predict many aspects of the ending within 98% accuracy half way through the book.- it seemed like the whole book was a repetitive series of disbelief-discovery-awe-disaster.	1
	bottom line: i would recommend this if you enjoyed dan brown's other works.       	1
	dan brown's latest novel.dan brown's latest novel, the lost symbol, takes the reader on yet another journey with professor robert langdon.	1
	much like the other brown novels, the author takes us on another scavenger hunt this time for the 'lost symbol.'	1
	the novel may be too technical for many readers, and often goes way too deep to uncover hidden meanings and symbols.	1
	looks like dan had a little too much time on his hands since writing the da vinci code.	1
	the story itself is very interesting, and the historical information on washington held my interest.	1
	for the most part, the lost symbol was a page turner for me although i found myself skipping ahead in paragraphs because it seemed too descriptive or technical or just plain boring.	1
	the most disappointing part of this book is the constant regurgitation of philosophical and religious messages - we got it the first fifty times that someone said that humans are like gods.	1
	also it seemed like brown also felt like ripping off the dolarhyde character from harris' red dragon.	1
	all in all, the story has an interesting twist, and i was able to actually finish reading without giving up due to lack of interest.       	1
	not as great as the last two but still really good.if you weren't a fan of his previous work, then this isn't going to change your mind.	1
	it follows the same pattern of robert langdon's previous adventures, combining action/suspense with some plot twists, puzzles and brown's version of history thrown in for intellectual stimulation.	1
	but i think it's a formula that works well and i've been enjoying it since the da vinci code.	1
	honestly, i don't think it quite lives up to the last two novels.	1
	i thought that the da vinci code provided a  more interesting story, while angels & demons had better pacing and more action.	1
	this book took a little longer to get going and i felt it went on a little longer than necessary after the climax.	1
	but the bulk of it was a great read and shows why brown is so successful as an author.	1
	he knows how to write a great page-turner and the story telling feels like you're reading the equivalent of a summer-blockbuster.	1
	the only reason i gave this book 4 stars is that i feel giving it 5 would mean it's on par with the previous two-which i feel it's not.	1
	however, it's a great book and something that will keep you flipping through the pages for most of it.      	1
	the problem with the publishing world.please read the amazon description for the plot.	1
	this is about the writing.	1
	no spoilers.	1
	having finished the book about a week ago, i've given a lot of thought as to why i didn't like this book as much as his previous entries.	1
	i have a theory that once an author is so popular that, on the cover, his name is actually larger than the title of the book, the publisher has turned editing into a formality.	1
	this book suffered from what i call too-big-for-his-pants-itis.	1
	i've seen it happen to stephen king, kathy reichs, john grisham, dean koontz, etc..., and it hasn't stopped.	1
	the amount of active editing, as compared to passive copy-editing, for these bigger-than-life authors takes a nosedive because the publisher knows that most of us will pretty much buy a grocery list with the right name attached.	1
	brown's other books were well-edited and moved along at breakneck speed.	1
	in each subsequent book, you could see him growing as a writer.	1
	whoever edited his earlier work wanted him to be successful, and in turn, make money for the publishing house.	1
	this book was riddled with contrived dialogue and well-worn exclamations (!!!)	1
	that you just didn't find (a lot of) in his other novels.	1
	and this is the problem with the publishing industry today.	1
	look at the latest book covers of the big-name authors and the font size of their names is so large, you have to squint to read the title.	1
	when you start seeing that with your favorite author, it's over.	1
	their editors are simply running a spell-checker, probably making a few run-on sentences not 'run on' so long, and then it's off to the printing press.	1
	it wasn't always like this, and sadly, it's become the norm.	1
	how many times have you heard someone say or comment that his or her early novels were so much better.	1
	this is why.	1
	i've read a few koontz novels from his early days, and while the actual concept might have been a stinker, the writing was superb.	1
	fast-paced, trimmed to perfection, with his excellent ability of getting us to suspend disbelief.	1
	koontz barely even tries today, and what editor is going to tell their money machines that what they wrote is crap and will require months of rewrites.	1
	publishers don't even bother.	1
	which all goes back to my book cover, grocery list theory.	1
	i hope this trend ends soon, because the last few novels i read by grisham, koonts, and king (to name only a few) were so horrible i felt dirty for having put in the time to finishing them.	1
	maybe the publishing industry is in the toilet because people are sick of buying the hardcover book (or using kindle), finding it's nothing like the author's earlier work, and are rightly p.o.'d.	1
	they'd rather borrow the book from a friend who did pay top dollar for it or go to the library and check it out.	1
	in this economy, who wants to invest in a piece of garbage?	1
	remember the last time a movie was made based on a koontz or grisham or king novel?	1
	me neither.	1
	would you want to see a movie based on their latest work?	1
	the one thing brown does have going for him compared to the big boys is that in the publishing world, he's still a 'newish' author.	1
	i doubt he reads these comments, but if he does, here's my advice to him: continue educating us like you did in the lost symbol, and find another editor who isn't afraid to say, 'dan, we have a lot of work to do if we want to make this a thrilling bestseller.'	1
	same for king and all the others.      	1
	somewhat formulaic.as much as i enjoy dan brown, i thought that lost symbol was almost too focused on the lectures and i think the plot was not as strong as his other works.	1
	i didn't feel i knew enough about peter to care enough in the beginning to really feel the urgency langdon had to save his friend.	1
	i know the cia and others were involved near the onset, but i think skirting around the reason why they were there took away from the story.	1
	also, some of the 'surprise' moments in the book were a little formulaic and predictable.	1
	i think the main issue i had was with the opposition.	1
	in angels and demons, the reason why langdon was chasing illuminati signs was because they were clues.	1
	in da vinci code, it was because he was under suspicion for a murder and had to clear his name.	1
	i think that this book lacked that type of intensity.	1
	however, over all, the book was a nice, quick read; and the information about the masons was very interesting.       	1
	fun book to read dissapointing ending.i thoroughly enjoyed this book...until the ending.	1
	the book kept me guessing as to where it was going and who was the real 'villain.'	1
	this was so much fun and and exciting!	1
	like his other books i could not put it down.	1
	however the ending was anticlimactic and then ran on with about 30 pages too much.	1
	i would recommend this book as the majority of it is worth the disappointment at the end.       	1
	not as good as angels & demons.i always love dan brown's work.	1
	his short (and numerous) chapters make for ab easy read and make it hard to put down.	1
	i liked lost symbol and would recommend it.	1
	however, i thought the beginning was better than the middle which was much better than the ending.	1
	angels and demions is still my favorite dan brown novel.	1
	i think this laters work is written too much in anticipation of a movie deal.	1
	read it and judge for yourself.	1
	not up to dan brown's previous achievements.i enjoyed 'davinci code.'	1
	i enjoyed 'angels and demons' even more and thoroughly enjoyed the illustrated editions of both books.	1
	'the lost symbol' was a disappointment.	1
	while the idea of using washington dc as a setting for exploring early-american symbolism seemed fascinating, it didn't pan out; apparently, there aren't that many interesting symbols in dc after all.	1
	and, the big conspiracy wasn't so big.	1
	the giant cabal turned out to be closer to a rotary club than comintern.	1
	worse, a major subplot involving metaphysics was silly and wound up having little to do with the story.	1
	after the historical and intellectual sweep and scope of the earlier two books, 'the lost symbol' just seemed...smaller.	1
	if you're a dan brown fan, i'd wait for the paperback.	1
	if you're not a dan brown fan, i recommend reading 'angels and demons' and 'the davinci code' first.      	1
	the dan brown phenomenon.i write about this phenomenon only because dan brown has already become one of the most widely read authors in modern times.	1
	the fact that this is a real literary tragedy should not deter us from recognizing that people are reading his books and they are not reading my books.	1
	brown's last three books have created this phenomenon.	1
	angels and demons dealt with the roman catholic church and diabolical secret societies and was set in rome.	1
	the blockbuster davinci code dealt again with the roman church but also offered a revised version of early christian history with a plot spread over europe.	1
	the lost symbol deals entirely with the masonic order and is set entirely in washington, d.c.   lost symbol deals, as does all of brown's books, with arcane symbols, this time with those symbols and secret vows of the ancient and free order of masons.	1
	the hero, robert langdon, professor of something called symbology at harvard, is enlisted by what he thinks is his old mentor to lecture one sunday evening in washington.	1
	he finally realizes that he has been drawn into an involved family conflict that spreads to the masonic order and the possible discovery of the 'ancient wisdom' hidden somewhere in the depths of the city known for its masonic connections going back to the founding fathers.	1
	i have said enough about the plot in case my readers desire to follow the murky and highly repetitive wanderings of the characters through the labyrinthine world of masonic rituals, oaths, and secrets.	1
	from the start we are also introduced to one of the most evil characters in fiction, possibly worse than hannibal lecter in 'silence of the lambs' and javier bardem's assassin in 'no country for old men.'	1
	while i don't think the pacing of 'symbol' is as effective as that in 'angels' and 'davinci,' about half way through the characters begin their improbable escape from enemies that are not really their enemies until the climax on a sacrificial table in still another masonic temple  (surprised?).	1
	i have tired of brown's style and it was hard to stay up with the interminable impromptu lectures from professor langdon at most improbable times (while standing over a severed hand?).	1
	i also had a hard time recognizing that our knowledge that many of our nation's leaders are masons constitutes a national emergency of the level that the cia's greatest resources are employed.	1
	i know this is fiction, but there needs to be consistency and reality within the fictional world of a novel, right?	1
	to read about a person's drowning death, in language that is clearly describing a human death, only to be informed later than he really didn't die but was breathing water all the time ...  come one!	1
	that is a trick that an omniscient author plays on an unsuspecting reader that is entirely different from an unexpected plot twist.	1
	while it may appear that brown has done his research, latin and greek readers will recognize that he has made serious mistakes in translating both of these languages and the supposed insights that he shares from his linguistic mistakes are major steps in the plot.	1
	his research is so filled with mistakes like this and numerous other evil canards about masonic history that the poor masons probably are wondering how they are going to handle all the new applicants that will appear after this book is widely read!	1
	i hold no brief for the masonic order, but i do for christianity and brown has now done the same hatchet job on both.	1
	please, dan, spare us another novel that exposes whatever whipping boy you think will enlighten us - and add to your retirement fund!	1
	perhaps mother's day is a good target.	1
	i have always wondered about the diabolical secret codes embedded in those cards!	1
	hard to live up to the da vinci code..the da vinci code was great, angels and demons was good, the lost symbol...hmm....it was ok. yes, the book was too long and drawn out (and way too repetitive.)	1
	but the biggest problem was the ending -- rather unsatisfying -- don't want to blow it for anyone who hasn;t read this yet, but the problem was he set himself up to deliver an end result that was impossible to deliver on.....nice try.	1
	i'll give you another chance dan.      	1
	disappointing.i have been an avid fan of dan brown's novels, but can not give a good recommendation to this one.	1
	while it starts out as another page-turner following his now well-established formula, it loses steam about thre quarters of the way into the book.	1
	at this point, the climax of the story is reached (not a very exciting one) and the rest of the plot seems to exist just to explain the many loose-ends that were developed earlier, but not fully integrated into the story-line.	1
	it feels as if the author suddenly rushed to meet a deadline before he was truly finished thinking the plot through.	1
	to be fair, i immensely enjoyed most of this book and got a kick out of staying up late to finish it.	1
	it has all of the excitement and cliff-hanging qualities of his previous novels.	1
	it just peters out in the end.	1
	at least i got a discount when i pre-ordered with another book :).i found about 20% of this book enjoyable.	1
	the other 80% was fluff, repetitive fluff at that.	1
	blah blah noetics blah blah symbolon blah blah masons...400 pages worth.	1
	i thought about putting it back on the shelf at page 300, but i pushed on...for what i'm not sure (the paragraph describing a huge, tattooed sex organ...that seemed unnecessary, since he already went to lengths about the castration.	1
	actually, a friend tricked me into it.	1
	he said he had to have someone to suffer with.	1
	jerk.)	1
	i was very excited about this book, and ended up dissapointed.	1
	[...].	1
	like i said, about 20% of the book was enjoyable, the rest, in my opinion, could be torn from the spine.	1
	this book had no chance of being on the level of the davinci code, or angels and demons (my favorite), and i didnt expect it to be.	1
	i only had the hope of an enjoyable, fast read.	1
	i never expected it to be a complete waste of my time.	1
	i recommend against buying this book.	1
	borrow it, there will be no shortage of people willing to part with their copy.	1
	[...]?	1
	thanks.       	1
	not the davinci code.dan brown has struck again.	1
	but this time he has missed the mark.	1
	the lost symbol is not the davinci code.	1
	in the latter, he took on one of the most sacred institutions in the west.	1
	in this one, he takes on the ... masons.	1
	who cares?	1
	i didn't.	1
	i expect most of us don't.	1
	sure the research is great.	1
	the hidden symbols that mr. brown has constructed are extraordinarily clever.	1
	but it's a plot that makes a good book.	1
	and the plot is, well, boring.	1
	moreover, the level of sadism in this book is, in my opinion, gratuitous to a fault.        	1
	for me personally, somewhat surprising.my father, grandfather, uncles and brothers were/are masons.	1
	my dad was a 33rd degree mason, so the possibility that there is evil intent in freemasonry is such a foreign concept to me.	1
	when the reason for the cia's involvement becomes clear, all i could think was, 'how ridiculous.'	1
	that said, 'the lost symbol' was typical dan brown.	1
	the plot moves at a furious pace, there is little character development, and langdon gets the bad guy.	1
	i enjoyed all of his books because they teach as well as entertain.	1
	in my mind, brown will have a difficult time writing a novel better than 'the davinci' code.      	1
	not bad but not really good .	1
	.	1
	..i had great expectations for this book but was sadly left pretty disappointed.	1
	i'm a big fan of angels & demons and liked the da vinci code but the lost symbol just left me wishing dan brown had retired langdon's character before.	1
	the book started off a little slow for my liking.	1
	i didn't really get into it til around chapter 30.   my major issue with the book is it felt like it was going to go on forever.	1
	the only real shocking part (which i use loosely) came around chapter 120, yet the book continues for another 13 chapters.	1
	come on, end it already.	1
	i think if this had been the first of the robert langdon books i would have been ok with it but it just really didn't have the same page turning thrill brown's previous works have.        	1
	predictablilty from previous books being made into movies.i anxiously awaited the new dan brown book, the lost symbol.	1
	it was a bit slow to start off.	1
	once you get into the middle of the book it became very apparent that this book was written with the thoughts of being made into a movie.	1
	in the davinci code the book had depth and believability, and a great amount of information.	1
	the information allowed you to use your own imagination, leading some to investigate more on the topic.it left you thinking could there be some truth to it.	1
	in the lost symbol there was nothing left to wonder, no sense of depth to the concept.	1
	once i got to the end i was disappointed and felt let down, there was no pondering over the book and its contents.	1
	i must say this was nice to read but not on the level of the davinci code.      	1
	not brown's best.i have read all four of dan brown's books and loved them all.	1
	i was eagerly anticipating the release of the lost symbol.	1
	i pre-purchased it for my kindle and read it the first day.	1
	i was sorely disappointed.	1
	the story was fine but the time it took brown to get into the story was tedious.	1
	he spent pages explaining his theories and the masonic traditions and intentions.	1
	after about the first 1/4th of the book the action began and the reading was great for the middle half.	1
	there were lots of twists and turns that held my attention.	1
	then the story basically ended except the book continued with more teaching, preaching and attempts to inspire.	1
	this book wasn't bad but it could have been a great deal shorter.      	1
	not bad.this is a pretty good book.	1
	follows a formula similar to his other books for fast-paced, takes-place-in-one-day material.	1
	it is a light and easy read, and entertaining to be toured around one of my favorite cities, washington dc.	1
	there are no fatal flaws, however, there are several times when the antagonist and his history seems contrived, the historical relationship between this person and the person he kidnaps (trying not to reveal any spoilers) is underdeveloped in comparison to the high degree of psychotic dysfunction that characterizes his relationship with this person; all of which lead to a substantial imbalance in the climax of the story.	1
	at the same time, the primary protagonist - our old friend robert langdon - seems shallower and less robust that in prior portrayals, and at times uncharacteristically dense in the face of some of the symbology being revealed to him, during which time the reader is left with the impression that langdon is a dolt, unable to figure any of this out himself.	1
	to this end, the story overall is fine and makes for an entertaining read, but the climax and conclusion of the book are dissatisfying, falling squarely in the shadow of the first 400 pages of the book.	1
	still, i recommend it is a good weekend read.      	1
	a little disappointing.although i enjoyed this book, it wasn't as good as the previous two: angels and demons/ the da vinci code.	1
	i think dan brown is so popular that he thinks anything he writes turns to gold.	1
	and the suspense lags because of it.	1
	there needed to be more than just one villian in this story, and maybe a stir that really effected national security.	1
	this story kind of reminded me of a scooby-doo plot.	1
	but the last 30 pages were real fascinating to me.	1
	if the book was more about that, then maybe we'd be in there, describing this thing as a five-star quality!	1
	but maybe in the next book?	1
	as for this one, i can't give more than a 7 out of 10.      	1
	an average addition to the robert langdon series.most of the reviews here are dead on so i'm not going go into the plot.	1
	this book was kind of like a roller coaster ride.	1
	it started very slowly but eventually got very interesting and fun, and at the end, wound up screeching to a halt.	1
	the end of the book was the most disappointing.	1
	in his previous books, dan brown managed to surprise and awe us with the final revelation; however, in the lost symbol, this isn't the case.	1
	while, i enjoyed the whole ride, i was left wanting much more in the final chapters.	1
	honestly, i hope they don't make a movie out of this, or if they do, at least change the ending to something much more satisfying.	1
	i do hope dan brown continues to write more books, i really enjoy his in depth research and his way of exposing real-life societies. 	1
	equally interesting and annoying, (possible spoilers).first, the interesting parts.	1
	i found the details about things like noetic science and the history of freemasonry as well as the notable characteristics of washington dc landmarks quite intriguing.	1
	enough to encourage me to do a bit of research to determine how much of brown's information is factual.	1
	that's my idea of fun.	1
	overall, the book is well paced with a promising premise.	1
	brown is a good writer, but not a great one so i got just about what i was expecting...three stars worth of entertainment.	1
	even though i figured  out the secret location early on, i still enjoyed the riddle.	1
	i actually liked lost symbol more than davinci, but i prefer angels and demons to both.	1
	as for some of the more annoying parts, of which there were several, the most puzzling for me was trying to figure out what would be so earth-shakingly devastating about a mad-man releasing video of some masons running around in contumes, re-inacting a death ritual, that if not for cia intervention, said video would be the end of civil society as we know it?	1
	erm...not exactly.	1
	secondly, i could have done without the cartoonish portrayal of sato and mal'akh.	1
	for a minute there i thought i was reading an xmen comic, sheesh!	1
	third, i think it's pretty common knowledge that the cia is prohibited from conducting domestic operations and surely the capitol police would have known this.	1
	using the fbi or even the dept.	1
	of homeland security would've made more sense.	1
	finally there's the issue of thinly drawn characters and lack of realism in their dialogue.	1
	i would argue that an author could probably get away with one or the other of these flaws, but not both.	1
	by the time i reached the conclusion i scarcely cared what happened to any of the people in the story.	1
	here we have three people who have supposedly just endured a physically, mentally and emotionally harrowing turn of events in rapid succession and nobody even so much as requests a glass of water and a tylenol?	1
	instead, they just continue expounding esoteric philosophies to one another as if standing in a lecture hall without a care in the world?	1
	would it have killed the author to give his characters a few hours or perhaps a day or so to recover?	1
	all told, i have no regrets.	1
	it was a bit of fun, it's just that nagging feeling that this book could've been a lot better. 	1
	loved it but........there are 133 chapters in this book.	1
	at the end of chapter 130, i was ready to give this book 6 stars (yes six!).	1
	i wont spoil the ending for anyone, but the end just left me shaking my head and i even felt a bit cheated.	1
	lets be serious though, i would recommend this book to a friend, and the average reader will be entertained throughout.	1
	i love how dan brown slips in a few general tidbits here and there (ie., origins of the words 'sincere' and 'abracadabra') and the historical references are solid as always.great job dan, but the ending really sucked dude.....      	1
	dan brown becoming cookie cutter author?.i have read several of dan brown's novels including the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	i have enjoyed his work in the past, and looked forward to reading this new book.	1
	i downloaded the kindle edition of the lost symbol within a few days of its release.	1
	while i did read the whole book, the most i can say is that it is o-k.  i found if you take the first two books, use a different setting and a different secret organization, you will have the lost symbol.	1
	this book makes me worry that dan brown is becoming a cookie cutter author intent not on writing good books, but on selling movie plots.	1
	i did read to the end to find out what happened, but overall i was not terribly excited by the book.        	1
	the lost symbol.i have found dan brown to be generally anentertaining author and was looking forwardto this new novel.	1
	his attention to detail and basing his stories on factual organizations usually just fascinates me.	1
	the lost symbol however lost me.	1
	it left me feeling like i missed something in the story even while learning things about our nations capitol that i have never would have known otherwise.angels and demons or davinci code it was not.      	1
	coulda' been half as long.it had its moments, and was filled with several fun factoids, but was a little too drawn out.	1
	the antagonist's motives were almost silly and somewhat far fetched.	1
	formulaic dan brown; if this book was his first release it might left a greater impression on me.	1
	from the get go, you know langdon will at some point get to the washington monument, and very early on it was easy to catch on about who mal'ach really was...the threads connecting science and religion were interesting as was some of langdon's theological introspection.	1
	like i said before, formulaic dan brown, but still a fun read...      	1
	not his greatest work.i loved the davinci code, and angels & demons but i did not love the lost symbol because it was just dysfunctional.	1
	dan brown usually keeps you guessing with red herrings and little hints that do not pan out.	1
	i loved the travel around europe that was involved in the davinci code even if it was a bit forced i granted him that.	1
	angels & demons travels through rome and inside the vatican kept me on the edge of my seat but i had to force myself to finish the lost symbol.	1
	i will still continue to buy dan brown books because i believe he has it in him to continue langdon's great adventures, but i cannot recommend this book to anyone.      	1
	esperanza.al libro probablemente le sobren 100 o 150 pginas, y gran parte del mismo es predecible y repetitivo.	1
	pero pase un lindo momento leyndolo, aprend varias cosas, y me encanta el mensaje que intenta transmitir.	1
	muchas partes estn escritas casi como un guion de cine, algo que no me gusta mucho en una novela, pero tal vez ayude a hollywood a hacer una pelcula que proyecte el mismo mensaje y no el opuesto.	1
	no se si la idea de masonera de la que habla existe hoy en da, pero como ideal es muy interesante.	1
	entertaining, but disappointing.i mostly enjoyed the book, but it's no da vinci code.	1
	tough act to follow.the ending was a bit of a letdown, and while i pretty much agree with brown's take on organized religion, he really does get long-winded and preachy about it.	1
	very suspenseful--but flops at the end.	1
	i have very mixed feelings about this latest dan brown  'blockbuster.'	1
	as in his other novels, he keeps the suspense alive, and adopts the same technique of having each mini-chapter end on a note of extreme apprehension, so the reader feels compelled to read the next chapter.	1
	this book is a page-turner!	1
	although the progression of events was quite enthralling, at some point the denouement of the entire drama became rather obvious.	1
	the location of the great world-shattering 'secret' was quite evident for me about 2/3 through the book.	1
	and it seemed that the good professor langdon, instead of becoming smarter and more perceptive through the series of adventures he had been involved in with previous dan brown books (angels and demons, and davinci code)  actually became dumber and dumber.	1
	having been deceived once at the beginning of the story, he easily fell into the 'bad guy's  ambush later and seemed to be so myopically bound by his great 'expertise' as a vaunted harvard scholar, that he failed to discern the obvious at many points in the book.	1
	the revelation of the great secret near the end was a total flop and it was hard to believe that a group of powerful, aware people (high-level masons) could dedicate their entire lives to concealing and protecting an age-old 'secret' that in the end turned out to be very mundane.	1
	the involvement of the highest levels of the cia seemed a bit ludicrous.	1
	the idea that the bad guy could basically overturn the political world as we know it by releasing his video and thus cause a major 'national security event' seemed grossly exaggerated once the contents of the video were revealed.	1
	but the participation of the cia did provide a lot of opportunity for high-speed suv chases, black helicopter interventions, and special-ops agents doing their thing.	1
	i can already imagine a somber-expressioned tom hanks careening through the streets of dc trying to forestall the dastardly deeds of the bad guy in the next dan brown flick.	1
	the very apotheosis of the book quite surprised me (pun here, read book to 'get it') --and not in a good way.	1
	after all the harrowing events, the revelation of the secret of the ages, and the final moment of jubilation and discovery by the exhausted hero and heroine, the latter delivers a pedantic and lengthy lecture to langdon!	1
	all while they are positioned in a kind of cliff-hanger location, awaiting the very last revelation in the book.	1
	i realize that i have panned this book pretty badly.	1
	nonetheless, it raises fascinating questions about the nature of human consciousness and how our consciousness interfaces with the 'external' world.	1
	dan brown briefly references some amazing discoveries at the frontiers of physics and consciousness studies.	1
	and the book as a whole attempts to connect these contemporary discoveries with ancient wisdom.	1
	as in his other books, dan brown is a master of the graphic, dramatic image.	1
	the final scene depicting the bad guy is absolutely unforgettable.	1
	there are also many fascinating facts about architectural 'mysteries' around washington, dc.	1
	i am sure any reader who visits dc will see it in a totally different light.	1
	all in all, the book is entertaining, and for that i will somewhat grudgingly give it 4 stars.	1
	but it could have been so much tighter and had vastly more impact.	1
	the basic theme of the book---the converging of ancient wisdom with leading-edge science--offers tremendous opportunity for some really powerful storytelling.	1
	hopefully dan brown's next book will be better crafted and, if it has langdon as a protagonist, will show the good prof getting brighter as he goes along.	1
	screenplay ?.although this book was interesting, brown, i feel has two issues with the book.	1
	first, i feel he has caught the john grisham bug in that this reads as if it were written for a screenplay.	1
	yes, a lot of work went into but it was not of the caliber of the 'davinci code' and certainly not 'angels and demons' ( which i thought was the better of the two).	1
	secondly, i just finished the book and although the main 'action' ended , the book goes on for another 30 pages about freemason's ideology and other esoteric/religious discussions.	1
	a bit, no, quite a bit boring since most of the book was about the same subjects.	1
	in my mind this is the tom clancy bug...in clancy's case it's 20 pages on how a submachine gun works.	1
	glad i read it, but also glad i borrowed it from the library to do so.        	1
	def not par with davinci code.dan brown knows how to keep the suspense, and push each scene short and keep them from going stale.	1
	however, he repeats the same phrases quite endlessly, making the book feel painfully squeezed out of him, rather than enthusiastically.	1
	there are many times when prof langdon's thoughts and speech are rehashing same pattern and phrases ad nauseum.	1
	i probably will look forward to his next book, but my anticipation will be very much tempered, my recommendation to others more muted.      	1
	a little disappointed....i read 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code' early this year and couldn't wait to read 'the lost symbol'.	1
	the first two books in the robert langdon series were brilliant.	1
	'the da vinci code' was a masterpiece.	1
	however, when i finally got my hands on a copy of 'the lost symbol', i was a little disappointed.	1
	it was a huge step down from 'the da vinci code'.	1
	there weren't a lot of exciting, thrilling parts in the book.	1
	it seems as if dan brown was, more or less, 'playing it safe' with this novel.	1
	all in all, it's a good read.	1
	not great, but good.	1
	i try not to be too disappointed, because it would have been hard for anyone to write a sequal to 'the da vinci code' and it be as good or better.       	1
	created interest in the freemason influence on our history.compared to dan brown's earlier novels, i would place this dead last.	1
	the most interesting sections of the book developed the freemason influence on the formation of america.	1
	however, nicholas cage does a better job in the national treasure series, especially with diane kruger, where there is a real connection.	1
	a basic underlying theme of the novel was that no character, not even mal'akh, was fully developed.	1
	one wonders if robert is a eunuch as well as mal'akh in that he never seems to have an emotional or sensual connection to any of his damsels in distress.	1
	katherine seems to have feelings for robert but they are never fully explored or explained.	1
	it seems that truly intelligent dan brown characters are devoid of sexual attraction.	1
	walter (?)	1
	bellamy appears to be an important figure who trails off into nothingness.	1
	peter's physical introduction in the second half of the book is pure mythology (1) he shows little if any feeling for his son after rediscovering him, and (2) impractical guiding of robert to additional clues after having just lost his right hand (a physical if not emotional incapability.)	1
	a truly interesting character is inouc sato, who, for much of the book i thought was going to end up being aligned with mal'akh.	1
	if it had occupied any more of my time i would have been disappointed, but considering that borders sold them for 40% list price, it's not worth asking the author or publisher for a refund.      	1
	a page turner, but too familiar.dan brown hasn't lost the ability to write breathless action and countless plot twists, but both the action and the twists will be very familiar to those who have read the da vinci code and angels & demons.	1
	replace mal'akh with the assassin or the albino, and little is lost.	1
	the masons start to blend in with the illuminati and the templars.	1
	langdon has the necessary tag-along love interest, and together they carry an item that reveals a maze of hidden meaning in a large city.	1
	the only real difference is you feel that less is at stake in this novel.	1
	the threat that langdon is trying to prevent doesn't materialize until very late in the book, which for the first few hundred pages makes you wonder why we're paying such close attention.	1
	some people criticize the very end of the book (i.e., after the action-filled climax), but i found those pages to be the most enjoyable.	1
	it was the first time where the pacing of the book slowed down, and dan brown's thoughts were given room to breathe...and they were compelling.	1
	but those touching pages come too late to save the book as a whole.	1
	in the end, the book comforts you to let you know that dan brown can find a layer of mystery in well known places and wrap an exciting story around it, but it makes you wonder why it took him 6 years to write such a formulaic effort.        	1
	pretty good read typical of dan brown.i have read his other books and this one is similar in plot and structure.	1
	i feel it is about 100 pages too long as it seems to bog down towards the end.	1
	like his other books, it mixes fact with fiction and goes off on a quasi-religious philosophical jaunt that gets repetitious and a bit boring.	1
	not a bad read, but it can put you to sleep several times.      	1
	entertaining, easy read.it's been a few years since i've read dan brown's previous novels, so i can't fairly compare.	1
	i know i enjoyed them and read them quickly, but i don't remember much about the plots.	1
	lost symbol will probably be remembered in the same way.	1
	it was entertaining and easy to read.	1
	my only real complaint (pet peeve) with the novel was that very other chapter seemed to end with a cliffhanger as the story progressed.	1
	i know it's supposed to be a suspenseful story, but so many cliffhangers got a little tiresome.        	1
	if i didn't live in the area, 2 stars.there are lots of good reviews already, i hope to add a little perspective for those of you that read heavily in this genre.	1
	1) if you read him before and thought highly of da vinci code, this is likely a disappointment.	1
	2) if you read da vinci 1st, you probably decided you want to read more dan brown.	1
	if you read lost symbol 1st, you may be thinking about trade-ins at the used book store, not where to find shelf space.	1
	p.s.	1
	the last word, sentence, of the book ...... gag me!      	1
	chuckles and winks.i'm not sure if i'm in a minority or not, but is it so much to ask that writers be expected to adhere to certain standards before being published?	1
	as a freelance writer myself (and an editor during my day job), it's my task to make sure my writing is of a literate and technically correct quality before i send it out to grace the public's ears and eyes.	1
	as an avid reader, i cross genres quite often, and lately i've been noticing that more and more so-called 'popular fiction' books are written so poorly that even a high school student could pick out the flaws.	1
	'the lost symbol' is definitely one of these books.	1
	while it did keep me turning pages, the distractions from the abysmally-constructed plot and grammatical problems were completely insurmountable.	1
	really, how many times did characters wink or chuckle?	1
	does anyone do these things anymore?	1
	adverbs anyone?	1
	lots and lots of adverbs?	1
	and one of the central tenets of good fiction, 'show, don't tell' totally ignored?	1
	by the time i finished the book (amidst a lot of eye-rolling and groaning), i was both awed and angry.	1
	the awe stemmed from my admiration at the sheer amount of information contained within the book.	1
	one reviewer here stated that he felt like he was reading wikipedia, and i completely agree.	1
	this book will probably do more to boost tourism in washington d.c. then any amount of promotional dollars could ever accomplish.	1
	the anger was prompted by the book's ending.	1
	are you kidding me?	1
	that's it?	1
	that's the payoff for reading through chuckles and winks, stereotypical characters, a bumbling protagonist, a slew of idiotic plot twists, and more mini-cliffhangers-that-weren't-really-cliffhangers than you could shake a stick at?	1
	one of the indications, for me, that i am impressed with a book is the number of times i read it.	1
	we have a huge library here at home and many of the volumes have been read by me more than once (in some cases, several times).	1
	i do own a copy of 'the davinci code', but it has been read only once.	1
	[...] [...] jonathan barnes' 'domino men' and joe hill's 'heart-shaped box' are two examples of superb thrillers i can think of off the top of my head that are far more deserving of the attention dan brown is getting for 'the lost symbol'.	1
	with all this being said, i'm part of the problem too.	1
	i purchased this book and wasted a week of my life reading it.	1
	but i can hopefully make better choices in the future.	1
	in the meantime, i'll go chuckle and wink at someone and see if they look at me like i'm a lunatic. 	1
	lots of action but for what purpose?.this is definitely action-packed and filled with symbology, just like the davinci code but that's about all that can be said in its favor.	1
	the plot is outrageous, the plot twists contrived, and the underlying premise is ridiculously homo sapiens-centric and self-indulgent.	1
	i raced through this book only to find an ending that did not satisfy.	1
	to me it felt like the entire meat of the book (at least its intellectual premise) was contained in the first hundred pages and the rest was just tacked on to make a contrived roller coaster ride.	1
	i'm thinking this would have been much better as a novella.      	1
	not the worst book.	1
	but stupid..i don't know.	1
	dan brown does alright when he keeps things moving, but when no ones dying, running, or unlocking mysteries, we tend to pay attention to the actual writing, which is not a great idea.	1
	it's like brown doesn't trust his readers to figure out anything on their own so he has to spoon-feed them every descriptions and revelation.	1
	it just makes you feel stupid.	1
	[...]      	1
	entertaining but fizzles in the end.having read all of dan brown's other novels i can easily say this is not his best work.	1
	the novel starts off strong, with a good mixture of excitement and information.	1
	the background information on the freemasons as well as noetic science were intriguing, it will now be interesting to go and sort out what was fact or fiction.	1
	the first 450 or so pages are typical dan brown, filled with the forced cliffhangers we have come to expect.	1
	if you have been a fan of his previous novels, you will definitely feel comfortable with these chapters, and at times feel the book is almost formulaic.	1
	perhaps it is time for brown to move away from robert langdon and move towards the direction of his earlier novels such as deception point.	1
	my main problem with the book came with the ending, which seemed to slow to a crawl, and become very preachy.	1
	overall, still worth a read, but keep your expectations in line.      	1
	interesting facts but no substance.while i found the facts about the architecture of washington, dc fascinating and the information about the masons interesting, the story was a failure.	1
	it is pretentious, annoying, and peopled with two dimensional characters.	1
	you would think by now we would be learning more about robert langdon, but in this book he is nothing more than a prop for the convoluted plot.	1
	boring and annoying.       	1
	predictable.i was so looking forward to diving into this book.	1
	i even pre-ordered it at 40% off - thank goodness.	1
	i'm glad i didn't pay full price.i felt like i was reading something i'd aldready read.	1
	i'm not even finished yet and can't wait for it to be over.	1
	this book is so predictable it's irritating, but i'm going to finish it.	1
	the only saving grace is that i now know something about the freemasons.	1
	i should have started reading it from the end.	1
	too much hype, too few surprises.       	1
	same story, not as interesting..  honestly, meh.	1
	i think it's not a great sign that a third of the way through the book i was actively hoping for the death of two of the characters so that i wouldn't have to read about them anymore.	1
	while the adventures of robert langdon used to be real page-turners, this one was far from engaging.	1
	maybe because it was just the same formula- over the top villian, check; robert langdon is the only one who can save the world, check; the officials are sort of on board but no one trusts each other, check; there's a strong, smart & mildly to very annoying woman helping robert, check; older mentor in the picture, check.	1
	read it before, only it was more interesting the first two times.	1
	i will say i read the kindle version, on a k1 & the images were fine.	1
	the only one that was difficult to see was a floor plan & in no way did it detract from the story.	1
	formatting was just fine.      	1
	too long, too tiring.i wanted this book to finish after 350 pages, but it's like the eveready bunny.too many cliches, too many trite 'eureka!'	1
	moments.	1
	maybe getting through it was my 'at-one-ment'....i loved the davinci code & angels and demons.	1
	sorry dan.....      	1
	not bad - not spectacular.all in all, this was an enjoyable book.	1
	however, i had a few problems with it.	1
	first of all, i think the reaction to the video in today's world would not be anything near what brown tried to tell us it would be.	1
	and, some of the twists were not that hard to figure out.	1
	i had the main one (not trying to give anything away) figured out less than halfway through.	1
	it's a good read, but not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it.	1
	obviously, all of the hype was to sell as many as possible, and i suppose it succeeded at that.	1
	for the next dan brown book, i plan to sign up for it at the library.	1
	i'm still annoyed at myself for buying both the hard copy and the kindle edition for my iphone so my husband and i could read it at the same time.	1
	all in all, brown tries to make major issues out of things that aren't issues at all, and follows it up with a weak, syrupy sweet ending.	1
	i really expected better and was disappointed.      	1
	different parameters.i found it interesting that there is such a wide range of ratings for the lost symbol.	1
	many 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's and 5's.	1
	how could a book possibly elicit so many diverse opinions?perhaps people are rating this book from different perspectives.	1
	ok.  why not?from the perspective of whether it is a bestseller the rating must be 5.  number 1 on amazon's list of best selling books.from the view of whether it is entertaining, i enjoyed the book if i often suspended further belief with a smile.	1
	much to take not too seriously, but it was fun.	1
	i gave it a 4.are the writing skills great?	1
	does the the lost symbol have the wit and wisdom of a robert parker novel?	1
	probably not.	1
	gave it a 3.so the statistician in me took the average and calculated a 4.  didn't even have to take off my shoes to do the math.       	1
	wait for library copy - nothing 'lost' but your money.i just couldn't wait for the library and what a mistake.	1
	i've read worse thrillers but none that seem to promise a tremendous surprise at the end, something earth shattering, and life changing, with ultimately a big nothing as a 'pay off.'	1
	it held my attention and interest in spite of one let down after another.	1
	i was a bit distracted at times by all the instances of 'borrowing' from everything under the sun, including the movie 'the abyss', history channel documentaries, and just plain stereotypical characters.	1
	in the end, the 'big secret' was pretty empty and laughable.	1
	all that said, it is interesting at times and won't be controversial like the da vinci code.	1
	i'm just sorry i spent hard earned money on what is ultimately a mediocre thriller with little new to offer.	1
	at least the ending wasn't as ridiculous as angels and demons.	1
	langdon doesn't use his tweed jacket for a parachute!      	1
	i really wanted to like this book.i was crossing my fingers that this would be good.	1
	i loved angels & demons.	1
	i liked da vinci code.	1
	i really wanted to like this but when i, a casual reader, can predict the two big reveals that not good.	1
	then the 'great' revelation of what the lost symbol was soooooo anticlimatic.	1
	it was sad.	1
	the last 20 pages read slower than the 20 chapters of the book at the beginning.	1
	the characters were too preachy and seemed ridiculously two dimensional at times.	1
	an utter disappointment.      	1
	does not live up to davinci or angels & demons.plenty of reviews already so i'll keep mine short.	1
	if this book's author wasn't 'dan brown' and it had nothing to do with 'the davinci code' or 'angels & demons,' this book probably wouldn't be a bestseller.	1
	dan brown's bag of tricks got worn out quickly.	1
	anyone who read davinci could tell this story was using the same mechanics.	1
	the plot didn't have that many twists, and there was no last-second double-crossing or revelation of a snitch.	1
	the climax was entirely anticipated if you ever read a mystery/suspense novel.	1
	if you loved 'angels' and 'davinci,' curiosity alone will compel you to read this.	1
	if you never read any of dan brown's stuff, this book won't be a good first impression.      	1
	would have been better than dvc.	1
	if it had come first..i'm surprised by all the negative review this book is getting.	1
	if you've read the da vinci code and liked it you'd probably like this.	1
	the story is pretty much the same, just a few different names and such.	1
	dan brown is definitely consistent.	1
	the characters are simply to static to become too interesting.	1
	i have to say i was definitely more into the da vinci code.	1
	to be fair, if you haven't read the da vinci code you'll probably love it, because you'll see it with fresh eyes.	1
	you could say the same thing about dvc for those who have read angels & demons.	1
	overall it's an excellent story, but that's about it.	1
	nothing totally revolutionary, though i really love the way he ends it.	1
	it's not overtly grandiose or surprising.	1
	it's a very serene ending that leaves you feeling peaceful rather than confused.      	1
	a long awaited book--a big disappointment.if this had been my first dan brown book, it would have been my last.	1
	way toooo long, not enough action, and not a great plot.	1
	angels and demons is still my favorite!        	1
	interesting vacation read.i had planned a trip for the weekend after the lost symbol came out so enjoyed spending time on the airplane, at the pool, and waiting at the airport reading brown's latest conspiracy adventure.	1
	it was a good read, but certainly not a book i'll probably look to read again.	1
	brown mixes reference to real art and real organizations with a vast array of conspiracy theories and loses the reader in a chasm between reality and fiction, as good fiction should.	1
	the level of detail that brown includes in his books shows immense research on the author's part - leaving this reader impressed.        	1
	too much history, professor.having just spent the weekend on this novel, i'm sorry to say it left me disappointed.	1
	i was curious enough about what would happen to robert langdon to keep turning the pages, and the puzzle-solving was fun as in 'the davinci code,' but there was too much detail in the historical references, and too much repetition of the main philosophical theme.	1
	additionally, the main villain was less interesting and too one-dimensional for most of the story as compared to the villain in 'angels and demons.'	1
	i enjoyed the plot twist regarding the villain at the climax of the story, but i had almost given up caring since he seemed so unrealistic.	1
	furthermore, it was too easy to figure out where the mysterious place langdon was being taken to blindfolded was near the end of the book.	1
	while i enjoyed the insights into masonic history and our founding fathers' beliefs, the ending lacked the dramatic impact of 'the davinci code.'	1
	i couldn't help connecting one scene in the book to one i'd already seen in 'national treasure.'	1
	too bad, and a curious coincidence.	1
	overall, brown has done his research, perhaps overwell, and there are some exciting moments in this story.	1
	yet many of the characters are unbelievable, and robert langdon, though resilient and brilliant as always, played too much of the sceptic-turned-optimist and not enough of the academic sleuth-turned-adventurer a la indiana jones as in brown's previous works. 	1
	just not what i anticipated.i am really not as 'taken' with this book as the other two - one of the biggest detractors, for me, is all the terminology (scientific) in the early chapters - i just skimmed over those pages because it was just way too far over my head!	1
	this is definitely not a 'grabber' book and for all the hype, very disappointed.       	1
	have i read this before??	1
	?.as most others have said, the book is really no different than angels & demons, or the davinci code, it follows the exact same formula.	1
	i couldnt help but think...'have i read this before?'	1
	as the similarities were that close.	1
	overall, it was an entertaining read, but not what i hoped it would be.	1
	as others have mentioned, i too felt like i was reading a book based on the movie national treasure at moments.	1
	i also felt like the book built up to a rather disappointing end that just sort of deflates the reader.	1
	i'm sure they're making a movie of this book as well, and i have a feeling that the 3rd time around might be a flop.	1
	again, you've seen and read this before, langdon in a race against time decoding symbols on the run, a nutcase who takes things to the extreme, a semi-love interest, a secret society, etc....you've already read this book, just in different settings.      	1
	the lost symbol reviewed by the book gourmand.dan brown's long awaited and much anticipated book satisfied and disappointed at the same time.	1
	if you can overlook the sometimes awkward writing and the didactic speeches towards the end, the lost symbol delivers a fast paced, action-packed narrative that entertains and hopefully (if all dan brown's clain in the beginning that all the art, monuments, rituals and organizations that exist in the book are real), educates.	1
	brown is at his best explaining symbols, rituals, secret societies and conspiracies.	1
	he is at his worst describing characters and the mundane details of their everyday life.	1
	early in the book, our narrator tells us that our hero after his fifty laps at the university pool in the morning, is home around six when 'he began his morning ritual hand-grinding sumatra coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitchen.'	1
	[...].	1
	brown, however, becomes more adept at describing other rituals.	1
	thank goodness.	1
	he writes well when he is talking about the freemasons, the knight templars and george washington.	1
	he explains art and symbolism well, he's just a little awkward when it comes to fictional characters.	1
	it's like reading a scientific journal with a little bit of harlequin romance imagery thrown in to keep the reader interested, so if you can get past the awkwardness brown can tell a good story.	1
	warning: spoiler alert what i haven't decided, however, is if i like the author's deceptive manipulation of the writing to obscure the plot line.	1
	if you're a detective novel enthusiast, you might probably figure out earlier in the book the true identity of the book's antagonist.	1
	but if you examine the text, you will realize that the author gives you no basis for your suspicions, other than the hunch that such a vengeful spirit could only exist if the stakes were higher.	1
	dan brown carefully weaves his words so we are constantly surprised by who's the evil one and who's in cahoots with him and why.	1
	he also seems to take pleasure in making robert langdon the ultimate skeptic, and in the process, making him seem incredibly dim and actually, quite stupid.	1
	the man who can speak multiple languages have a photographic memory and can solve the most unsolvable puzzles in the world sometimes acts like the victim in a teen horror movie.	1
	no!	1
	don't go in that door!	1
	don't you know the killer is in there?	1
	all this in the interest of moving the action along, i suppose, like just the purpose they serve in horror movies.	1
	robert langdon poses as the ultimate doubting thomas, refusing to believe, unable to accept, and then suddenly, before our book ends, he is converted.	1
	though i do not know that it is a completely unbelievable ending for our hero, what i find difficult to dismiss is how much of this book dan brown's manifesto to get the right-wing christians  to stop criticizing him from having his character proclaim in previous books that he did not believe in god.	1
	or their particular god.	1
	towards the end, the book becomes more and more theological in spirit.	1
	i have no qualms in including a theological discussion in a work of fiction.	1
	i am a big fan of dante's inferno.	1
	many great books (all if you believe joseph campbell's hero with a thousand faces which i am sure brown read and included its ideas in his book) have been written to wrestle with the idea of good versus evil and is there an ultimate good.	1
	dan brown uses ideas from plato, socrates, dante, campbell, jung and the list goes on and on.	1
	but ultimately what i am interested in when i pick up dan brown is did he tell a good story?	1
	i can see that a movie of this book will yet again be criticized for extremely long misplaced dialogues explaining philosophical teachings and scientific theories.	1
	i can see two actors trying to discuss noetic sciences and aristotle as they run away from bad guys down a long dark tunnel.	1
	movie possibilities aside, the lost symbol is still an entertaining book, one that i'm sure will provoke great interest in many, many topics both religious and philosophical, and hopefully, a renewed interest to visit our great american capital and visit its fine if sometimes boring museums.      	1
	it is what it is..the lost symbol is the third thriller featuring harvard 'symbolist' robert langdon.	1
	the book is similar in tone, style, pacing and plot to the previous entries.	1
	if you enjoyed the davinci code and angles and demons, you will enjoy this book.	1
	if you did not, nothing's changed, so you will find the same stuff to complain about.	1
	i found the concept of 'noetic science' to be hokey, dan brown's inability to use the word 'penis'  in favor of 'sex organ' to be oddly incongruous with the tone of the novel, and the wealth of the solomon family was presented like a grocery store romance author might.	1
	the cheesiness doesn't ever go away, but the story is gripping enough to make the book an entertaining read.      	1
	changing from 2 stars to 1 star.i originally posted here and gave this book 2 stars but the more i think about it the more i realize how awful this book was.	1
	i said that i hated to give this author 2 stars, but i'm really giving the book 1 star.	1
	this was boring and just an awful chore to get through and i feel that it is dishonest to give 2 stars when i think 1 is correct.	1
	there are over 300 reviews here (so far), so i don't need to repeat everything that was said, but besides having to endure countless pages of scientific and philosophical nonsense, you end up with a truly ridiculous 'lost symbol.'	1
	i kept reading because i was sure that at least the ending would be good, but 'yawn,' it wasn't.	1
	i can't recommend this and will not purchase another dan brown book until i've read the reviews.      	1
	da vinci deja vu.when i bought this book i wasn't expecting great literature but i was hoping for something more than a da vinci code retread.	1
	the set-up is almost exactly the same, and while there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between the characters in the last book and this, there certainly is congruency.	1
	so that was vaguely disappointing.	1
	of course, what we all really came for was the art & architecture, the symbols, the history, etc., and that's all here and as fun as ever.	1
	and there's science in this one that certainly gives you something to think about (though i'm not too sure the proof for that science is quite the slam-dunk brown thinks it is).	1
	so for me, it's a mixed bag -- and a mixed review.	1
	i think it's too much like its predecessor, but at least, if he's going to be formulaic about it, he has a good formula.	1
	borrow, don't buy on this one.      	1
	you might as well read it.some of it is okay, some of it is just downright goofy.	1
	borg like oneness of humanity.	1
	pretty thoughts can make pretty ice, ugly thoughts can make ugly ice... centuries ago people knew a whole bunch of crap.	1
	somehow, they forgot it all and now they don't even teach it at yale.	1
	thank god it's all still there in the dusty books in the solomon's family library.	1
	katherine is smart.	1
	somebody should just tattoo 'lastest dan brown lady genius sidekick' right across her forehead.	1
	robert langdon is .. schlumpy.	1
	it's a fit schlumpy 'cause he still swims everyday but he's still just a good ol' harvard lecturer.	1
	the college kids love him, he can make beer jokes.	1
	langdon knows things.	1
	he tells us things.	1
	he tells us about the hand of mystery!	1
	he educates and saves the world.	1
	can you do that?	1
	can you?	1
	the first page should be imprinted with the huge inscription:  'please check your belief at the door and prepare to suspend any and all logical thoughts in regards to plot, characterization, and plausibility.'	1
	if you can't do that, put the book down and walk away.	1
	the good lord knows i almost did.	1
	however, if you just want to see affable robert think about a bunch of stuff, his really smart female sidekick help him save humanity and her really annoying know it all brother, plus a whole bunch of mildly enjoyable action scenes.....  (interspersed with the dan brown lectures on a bunch of stuff you really don't care about but makes you feel smarter to pretend that you do), well then go ahead and read the book. 	1
	did i expect too much?.may i echo what many other reviewers have said?	1
	the plot of this story seemed to be a much-watered down version on the others in the langdon series, the description at times repetitive and laboursome and the 'twist' unsatisfying.	1
	yet i still enjoyed reading, but probably more so for the pleasure of the historical aspects of the novel, the descriptions of dc and the info about the founders of the us than for the story.	1
	of course part of the problem was over-anticipation, that which you wait for and idolise in the mind often does not live up to expectations.      	1
	too obvious.i really enjoyed dan browns other books but this book fell way short.	1
	the location of the lost symbol was obvious and brown spent way too many pages rambling on and on about theological and philosophical issues.	1
	lost symbol by dan brown.poorly written....hard to follow......usually like his books but don't waste your money on this one.      	1
	dan brown's latest.the lost symbol has elements similar to brown's previous books: people chasing around deciphering things, supposed disaster looming, a demonic villain, grotesque assaults, etc.	1
	i get the impression he's throwing crumbs to the masses--give them what they want, what they expect: some brown-type pulp in an automatic best-seller.	1
	he makes a lot of money; i can't fault his financial acumen.	1
	but as writing, as a novel, the lost symbol is not good and would not be published if it were by a lesser-known author.	1
	the plot and situations are very implausible, most of the characters are thin cardboard, their actions often illogical.	1
	the pace is sometimes fast, often slow to dead, with annoying repetition and long superfluous passages.	1
	there are loads of breathless descriptions of buildings in washington, plenty of praise for 'ancient wisdom' and the masons, but for a quality story and writing one must look elsewhere.              	1
	disappointed.after enjoying everything that dan brown has written to this point, i looked forward to the day that lost symbol would be available.	1
	i bought it on the first day and after 3 weeks, i still have a few pages left.	1
	it has not kept my attention or been the engaging, can't-wait-to-see-what-happens-next book that i expected.	1
	in fact, i have not enjoyed it much at all.	1
	it was clearly well researched but aside from that, it lacks the twisting plot and thriller suspension of his previous efforts.	1
	dan, don't force out a book just to publish another one.        	1
	preaching overtakes the story.i really enjoyed angels and the devinci code but this effort just does not do it.	1
	i am not the most astute reader of action books so when i can figure it out early on it is not a strong endorsement.	1
	i could not figure what drove the people and there was not any conflict.	1
	dan brown had a point that he spent the last 50 pages explaining.	1
	he obviously believes that he has a pulpit and will use it.	1
	that is not why i read a thriller so all in all i did not enjoy this.      	1
	good style & plot, but sudo-science core..i love all of dan browns previous books, and had high hopes for this one!	1
	it starts out great & keeps you in suspense like his others, but then he puts in bogus science stuff.	1
	even worse he then injects stupid bible scripture to go along with the bogus science!	1
	that's where it nose dived for me.	1
	professor langdon turns from a real skeptic & scientist to a weak minded believer of anything.       	1
	if you read past the words, there is a great story here.behind the myriad of writing flaws in this book, there is a brilliant story.	1
	the brilliance i read dan brown for his fictional but poetic interpretation of real symbolism from our everyday world, along with the tantalizing morsels of revelation i get along the journey toward the final unveiling.	1
	i thought the basic plot and the immersion into freemasonry and its symbols in our nations capital were breathtaking.	1
	i thought the story behind the climax and denouement was spectacular.	1
	i just had to struggle to enjoy it because the words kept getting in the way.	1
	the blemishes 1. tell, don't show.	1
	most of the book is telling.	1
	i'm told what the characters are doing and thinking.	1
	'catherine lay bleeding.'	1
	don't tell me catherine is bleeding.	1
	show me.	1
	in addition, often in the book i feel as if a narrator is interrupting the action and emotion to read hundreds of pages from a masonic encyclopedia.	1
	in the end, this book reads more like a late night history channel documentary with occasional amateur vignettes inserted for attempted drama.	1
	you could aptly re-title this book, 'the telling.'	1
	2. cliche overload.	1
	much of the dialogue is top-of-the-head writing.	1
	characters use the same responses repeatedly.	1
	3. the story rarely offers momentum.	1
	i was led to believe the entire story takes place in less than 12 hours.	1
	in reality, most of the story is either a knowledge dump or extended back story.	1
	i wanted to feel as if i were on a 12-hour roller-coaster.	1
	i didn't feel much at all.	1
	4. characters are flat and disconnected.	1
	the formula for each robert langdon novel seems to be, 'have a girl by his side to solve ancient mysteries, but have zero chemistry between them.'	1
	other characters are cliche, uninteresting, and provide no real tension in the relationships between each other or langdon and catherine.	1
	no matter how brilliant the story itself, characters must be interesting and drive the emotion.	1
	that simply doesn't happen here.	1
	5. fluff.	1
	much of the book could have been cut to actually increase the story's value and momentum.	1
	i find it hard to believe the editor of such a long-awaited novel allowed so much deadweight between the covers.	1
	the verdict if you don't mind reading past the text to get to the brilliant and poetic story behind it, i highly recommend this book.	1
	if you want emotional involvement and great character development, this book is not for you.      	1
	save your money.this book was a let down after dan brown's other books.	1
	i wouldn't recommend you buy it, but borrower it from a sucker like me that bought it.       	1
	i really, really wanted to like it...but i just didn't....i think the dan brown balloon has popped folks.	1
	i learned something with this book: dan brown is actually not a very good writer, but his subject matter is fascinating, and that is why his books sell.so here we have the lost symbol and the subject matter fumbles and we see more clearly that mr. brown's writing really is mediocre at best.i won't rehash the other 600+ reviews except to say there is way too much banter between he characters, more than was needed to tell the story.	1
	i think a lot of this 'fluffery' was left in just to make the book longer.	1
	at least a hundred pages could and should have been cut from this book.i'd wait for the paperback if i were you.      	1
	total dissapointment.i love this kind of  a book; but this was a total dissapointment.i am glad i now have a kindle and only paid the kindle edition price, even this, may i ask for a refund?	1
	i have never done this before as reading is my passion and i have certain respect for the writer and his product,but this book is really bad,i feel i needed to warn fellow readers.	1
	if you must,just get it out of the library and by the way when is the release date for this feature on kindle? 	1
	new-age book disguised as a robert langdon novel.i would like to start with the positive- i managed to read this book all the way to the end and even enjoy most of it.	1
	however..... the impression i got is that mr. brown wanted to send a message of hope and peace to the world and chose his familiar, readers- attracting protagonist, robert langdon, to do so.	1
	this is the only thing that can explain the weak plot, the predictability, the sudden stupidity of mr. langdon, the not-even-remotely-shocking 'shocking revelations' and the endless repetitions.	1
	in fact, practically half the book reads like a questionable encyclopedia/new-age self-help book/ philosophical-theological manifesto rather than like a novel.	1
	although the trivia parts are what i liked about the dvc, mr. brown took it too far this time.	1
	luckily, i did find the subject interesting which is what kept me reading but if you are looking for a fast-moving plot and a lot of action this is not the right book for you.    	1
	a 15 hour read.	1
	dissapointenly simular..washington,dc is the location and the freemason's the mystery, interestingly he tells us a lot about both .	1
	the story is drawn out over a one day time, and it takes about 15 hours to read the book.	1
	the way the story is written is to much like the pass two, the same kind of characters, chase sequences , antagonist, a little plot twist at the end .there is a  long pro church speech at the end .	1
	it seams that brown is trying to get the churches approval for this one .	1
	the tour of washington,dc was well researched, but other wise the book was a disappointment.      	1
	predictable and tiresome: deeply disappointing.dan brown's first two books, angels and demons and da vinci code, are true thrillers.	1
	this book fails.	1
	the plot starts out with great promise but quickly degenerates into a series of predictable and tiresome sequences.	1
	the 'bad guy' is a loner and this becomes apparent 1/3 of the way into the book.	1
	by then, one quickly realizes that what a single person could do to harm the protagonists is really limited, and so the sense of drama is quickly lost.	1
	the whole parallel plot about the cia's involvement looked promising, but it was so prosaic (they're the good guys, much to my disappointment) that it turned into a huge let down for me.	1
	the worst part of the book is the ending.	1
	the final 30 or so pages are completely superfluous.	1
	by the time i got to the last section, the 'bad guy' had died and the drama had ended.	1
	still, the story dragged on, hinting at the revelation of a deep mystery.	1
	i felt compelled to plod on, but more i read, angrier i became.	1
	it was all religious and philosophical fluff.	1
	i felt cheated.	1
	the da vinci code was way better.	1
	be warned! 	1
	shame!.this is perhaps the worst.	1
	most pretentious book i have ever read.	1
	a total waste of money to read the author's silly ideas.	1
	it is only because i paid less for the kindle edition than the hardcover that i take any solace.      	1
	about 200 pages of this 509 page book should be deleted.the lost symbol was not nearly as exciting or interesting as the da vinci code, so for those who are reading it expecting more of the same, you will be disappointed.	1
	the primary problem with this book, in my opinion, is that brown tries to cram too much detail into his explanations of the various symbols, myths, etc.	1
	that he brings into the book.	1
	the provocative parts of the book involve the characters, and the tension created when wondering what is happening to the characters and who is doing what to whom.	1
	there are missed opportunities for even more exciting plot twists, and there were some missteps in the plot when brown avoided having a character (or set of characters) do what would be obvious and logical in order to achieve what he wanted in his story.	1
	much of the book read like an extended made-for-tv movie.	1
	a good one, but not a great one.	1
	also, i believe the story ended about 50 or 60 pages before brown ended it.	1
	i was bored and exasperated by the last few chapters, and really didn't care about what happened in brown's ending.	1
	definitely a disappointment, but enough to make it worth reading.	1
	i recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library, however.	1
	don't spend any money on this book if you don't have to.      	1
	don't buy candy and complain about the sugar.this book is fun, just like most of dan brown's other books.	1
	it is not a literary masterpiece, just like dan brown's other books.	1
	it is fairly formulaic, just like dan brown's other books.	1
	but it's still fun!	1
	anybody who buys this book looking for some sort of stunning piece of writing by a masterful author obviously has never read dan brown...it's like walking into the theater, watching 'transformers', then complaining that it wasn't 'citizen kane'.	1
	sit back, relax, turn off your brain and enjoy the ride...      	1
	cops and robbers.interesting symbology, but mostly a boring chase through capitol and dc basements with a crazed cia director.	1
	not exactly an intellectual mystery.      	1
	mired down in minutia....anyone who has read previous dan brown novels is aware that he fills his work with an abundance of well researched facts that he then weaves a facinating story around.	1
	what happened here?	1
	facts...absolutely, well researched...no doubt, facinating story...not so much!	1
	i never thought i'd have trouble getting through a dan brown novel, but i found myself struggling with the lost symbol.	1
	i continued reading hoping for the 'big reveal...the big ending' but was sadly disappointed.	1
	i can only 'hope' that if robert langdon makes another appearance, he is rewarded with a better more exciting vehicle.      	1
	should be called 'the lost novel'.i always thought i liked dan brown's writing.	1
	all of his novels have been thought-provoking, and the early thrillers (digital fortress, deception point) were very good lead-ins to the gripping angels & demons and the davinci code.	1
	so i started the lost symbol with great expectations, only to become bogged down in endless pomposity ('the rose cross,' langdon explained, 'is a common symbol in freemasonry.	1
	in fact, one of the degrees of the scottish rite is called 'knights of the rose cross' and honors the early rosicrucians, who contributed to masonic mystical philosophy.	1
	peter may have mentioned the rosicrucians to you'), driven forward by melodramatic pronouncements ('you will help me stop this man,' sato said.	1
	'he has the potential to bring about a cataclysm from which this country might not recover').	1
	the good guys are all wooden and the bad guys are caricatures, including an apparently psychotic cia security director and a narcissistic, merciless killer (in this case a tattooed mystic rather than an albino monk).	1
	i struggled through to page 330, then gave up.	1
	my advice is to wait for the movie.      	1
	utter rubbish!!	1
	!.how dissapointing!	1
	being an ardent fan of dan brown and his character robert langdon, this was one of those few books i was really looking forward to.	1
	and what a let down.	1
	i really don't quite know how to put it any other way, but it appears as though the success and sensationalism of the da vinci code & angels and demons has overwhelmed mr. brown's creative skills.	1
	for instead of writing what could have been a worthy addition to the robert langdon series, he appears to have put his pen to paper with the intention of writing a screenplay for another movie as opposed to actually focussing on a good book.	1
	a pity though.	1
	for the subject matter of his choice this time around, really would have made a riveting read had the storyline been fleshed out more thoroughly as proven by alan moore's bestselling graphic novel 'from hell'.	1
	mr. brown should have paid more attention to better character development and actual twists in the tale.	1
	instead, it appears he opted for excessive bloodshed and brutality, tragically under the misguided notion that a formula of that nature is key to a bestseller of a book and a blockbuster of a movie.	1
	sadly mr. brown, i beg to differ.	1
	a wasted opportunity.	1
	0/10      	1
	what a bunch of baloney.to tell you the truth i wanted to know something about masons, described even in a fictional form.	1
	and at the beginning it was kind of interesting, but then, literally horrors began.	1
	character undeveloped, plot is week, and preaching of a new age stuff.	1
	stop it!!	1
	if you had any real knowledge of any religion described you wouldn't mix them all together.	1
	the book is simple abuse of a reader intelligence.        	1
	major disappointment.there is much being written about the problems with dan brown's writing and they are valid; i have enjoyed his ability to tell a good story though.	1
	with 'angels' and 'da vinci' there was fast pacing, impossible situations somehow escaped.	1
	it's pure escapism.	1
	but boy, 'symbol' really kind of fell apart.	1
	i found myself getting toward the end and coming close to tossing the book because it was all so obvious and superficial.	1
	the big 'twist' , the character reveal that i assume was supposed to shock was one that was clear from early on in the book.	1
	he has a tendency to over describe, over explain and this time it revealed this big reveal much too soon.	1
	i can't help but feel tightening up the writing could tighten the plot and be more suspenseful.	1
	of the three book, this is, in my opinion, the least of the three.	1
	if they make a movie from this one maybe leaving some stuff out would make for a better movie (unlike 'angels' where i sat through the movie saying 'no', 'it wasn't like that' and being irritated by the elimination of one or two of the book's significant characters.	1
	)the area of noetic sciences is fascinating, really exists, and continues to reveal that the more we learn the less we seem to know.	1
	i appreciate brown 'delving' into this area of understanding even if mangling it a bit.on reflection i'm not sorry i read the book, i just wish it had been several degrees better.      	1
	the not very lost symbol.to start, i loved the davinci code and don't really have a gripe with the writing style although it is fairly repetitive.	1
	loved the art history and symbol portions, which are really the reason to read dan brown.	1
	otherwise... my main problem with the book is that the huge secret that the masons have been keeping safe for centuries in order to protect humankind dissipates into nothingness once it's revealed:  it is not actually much of a secret and humankind wouldn't give a hoot to learn about this so-called 'secret information' anyway.	1
	you probably could not pay humankind to learn or care about this 'secret'!	1
	also, i figured out the twist pretty early on.	1
	this particular kind of twist requires some very adept writing skill, otherwise the awkwardness of the sentence structures act as a huge clue that things are not as they seem.	1
	the whole fun of twists is that you don't see them coming.	1
	it is not fun when you notice them from the beginning.	1
	so, dan, please write another book like the davinci code which introduces us to a very intriguing new concept that is hidden in age old symbols.	1
	and forgot this national treasure retread that goes nowhere.      	1
	decent thriller - derivative story - fast read.purchased at the airport, i read half the book between jfk and dfw and the other half on the way home.	1
	6 hours of reading.	1
	this book is virtually identical to all of dan brown's other books -- same type of clue-to-clue storyline, robert langdon and his quirks back again; and bizarre science and enough esoteric fact to keep you flipping the pages wondering how much is real and how much is made up.	1
	that being said -- you can figure out the villain within a few chapters, and you can figure out that the entire chase is one big macguffin to get to your conclusion.	1
	here's the payoff: there isn't any!!!	1
	530 pages later you have no satisfactory conclusion.	1
	no big underlying mystery like in divinci code.	1
	no big character twist like in angels and demons.	1
	all you get is spiritual mumbo-jumbo.	1
	read it.	1
	it's fast and fun.	1
	the villain truly is a fun character, even if robert langdon himself has become tiresome and boring.	1
	but don't expect divinci code.	1
	this is not divinci code.      	1
	the lost symbol is entertaining...although i did have higher expectations.i was looking forward to the lost symbol and another dan brown thriller in which the plot and his writing had aged like a fine wine.	1
	although the story was enjoyable, and is indeed somewhat of a thriller, it was not as impressive as i had hoped.	1
	while the story plot is good, i think the writing could have been better, and i guess i expected a more polished dan brown.	1
	pros+ the whole idea of solving a puzzle of symbols appeals to the inquisitive human mind.+ the story is a thrilling ride that takes place within the a short time period.+ robert langdon is a likable character that's easy to root for.+ the masonic theme is enough to keep most people interested.+ the lost symbol is an overall quick read (some chapters do move slow however).	1
	cons- character actions are not really believable.- some of the product mentions seem to standout too much (all of a sudden we need to call an suv a lexus?	1
	)- some of the technical jargon seems thrown in *just* to make it seem hip and new.	1
	(twitter is brought up at the end as well.	1
	)- i think many people will expect something of a big bang at the end, so they may be disappointed.	1
	although some people may assume an average rating means a terrible book, that was not the case for me.did it fail to meet my expectations of dan brown?	1
	yes.does that mean the book is terrible?	1
	no!the lost symbol is still an enjoyable read, although you might consider waiting for the paperback or buying the book used.	1
	the lost theology.dan brown's book, as usual, contains adventure, architecture, anticipation, the astuteness of details.	1
	as you read descriptions of characters, atmosphere, famous places, and action, you literally receive a visual as if your mind has became a movie screen filled with glorious color and movement.	1
	as entertainment, the lost symbol is pure escapist fun.	1
	unfortunately, that fun became increasingly disrupted with the characters' ramblings straight from an ancient cult called the gnostics.	1
	this errant philosophy started around the time of christ, and endures today.	1
	mr. brown has a right to insert his persoanl philosophy into his writings as any author does, but there really needs to be a 'warning' alert about this book.	1
	book burnings are just wrong, but to read this book without a critical analyzing process would also be wrong.	1
	gnostics worshipped knowledge above god, and believed that mankind should create god/god and then supercede him/him through enlightenment.	1
	the judeo-christian god was on the same level as the gods that the greeks and romans invented.	1
	the more knowledge a person has, the more god-like he becomes; until finally he is god!	1
	at the very least, such a theology is arrogant.	1
	it says that the pot is equal or superior to the potter who forms it from the clay.	1
	if you enjoy a suspensful mystery, this book is for you, but if you prefer judeo-christian values, that theology is lost!      	1
	a philosophy in search of a story.i enjoy dan brown's books...(even, as in a previous book, when he has his hero fall off of a cliff onto an ice floe where a passing submarine just happens to hear the noise and comes to the rescue.	1
	ok, maybe i don't enjoy that part, but i'm willing to overlook it.	1
	)and in 'the lost symbol' there are several interesting tidbits, thoughts, philosophies...enough to induce me to further research when the time presents itself, but there's no coherent story here.	1
	the line of action and reaction seems to be little more than an excuse to hear the author's unique take on knowledge, religion and man's place in the universe-- a perspective that is interesting and can provide fodder for debate.	1
	when you see what the characters are ready to trade for the 'lost symbol'--that a secret organization would hand down from generation to generation, that a man would trade his life, his mother's life, his sister's life and the hero's life to protect the secret--that the secret is obscured by several layers of codes, misdirection and hidden compartments-- you're ready to suspend disbelief about the cia and its diminutive and inscrutable security chief running such a bizarre operation.	1
	(spoiler) then you find out that the secret is that there's a bible in the cornerstone of the washington monument and the cia is trying to protect several washington vips from appearing on youtube because people might misunderstand what they're seeing...well, you start to feel as though the whole trip was unnecessary.	1
	the villain is misguided,  delusional and about as inconspicuous as a 10-ft. toothbrush, yet passes easily among the secret and elite societies of the world.	1
	the police are told there's a kidnapping and send a security guard to check it out, a woman is given a lab in a secret room inside of a room with no lights because...i don't know...her brother signed something, i guess.	1
	...  there's more, but you're probably going to read the book anyway.	1
	there's plenty of food for thought.	1
	just don't expect a great story.       	1
	disappointing, maddening, frustrating, but i finished it.well, i finished it but not because i was enjoying it, but because i kept thinking the next chapter would redeem it and i had 'hope' that it couldn't be this bad.	1
	i agree with almost all reviews except the 3+ stars.	1
	it started out entertaining, but started going downhill at about the 6th chapter.	1
	same words, same plot, same style of 'incredible', 'surprise', dumbfounded, stupid efforts to try to be exciting chapter after chapter and falling short.	1
	maddening at the attempts and writing.	1
	i had the two 'big' surprises or should i say 'secrets' figured out about half way through but couldn't believe that it would be that simplistic, so i kept going.	1
	yep, it was exactly what i thought.	1
	i knew who the evil villain was, and what the secret was that was hidden for centuries.	1
	not that i don't agree with the last few pages of 'insight' about 'the word', as i've studied much on new thought and energy healing, but how it was wovening and explained in the book as this being a brand new idea and a secret that was too dangerous to tell the 'common man' and it was not even explained very well at that.	1
	and the idea that the terrible national security threat was an expose' on the mansons.	1
	give me a break!	1
	don't buy it.	1
	buy devinci code it was worth the read, but this is not worth the paper used or the film if a movie is stupidly going to be made.	1
	tom hanks don't do it!      	1
	predictable.i have to agree with a lot of the other posts about the book being predictable and seems like a recycling of characters from the two previous books.	1
	i won't go into detail as the other posts as they have pretty much covered most items i happened to note.	1
	the book is 'okay' but wasn't worth the hype and 'pre-order' mania that preceded it.	1
	db needs to develop a different storyline since this one was pretty predictable.      	1
	formulaic, poorly characterized, unsatisfying ending.using archetype can be done well, but not in this book.	1
	the blind seer, the leader, the mad villain, the sidekick, the man on a quest - clearly recognizable types, but they were miserable 2-d characters here.	1
	and since some of their actions were so clearly counter-intuitive and predictable (and some based on psuedo-science), brown insults his audience.	1
	editorial problems include: clunky sentences, needless exposition when the reader has already been told more than once, an irrelevant puzzle, and an unsatisfying ending.	1
	there could have been a good ending at the climax, but instead of closing with the sun coming up (which would have been sufficient), langdon gets a rundown on what 'the secret' really is, which demonstrates the futility of the antagonist.	1
	it's an important element in any thriller, but there should also be measurable changes to the characters, creating a rewarding experience for the reader.	1
	after langdon gets his end-of-story lecture, he's skeptical.	1
	and so are we.	1
	on a positive note, the house of the temple, featured in the novel, is a frequently-overlooked dc tourist destination.	1
	it's not really a maze inside, as portrayed in the novel, but it's worth seeing.	1
	(and it can handle the foot traffic better than poor rosslyn chapel could after _davinci code_ quadrupled its tourist numbers.)	1
	brown shows the masonic brotherhood in a positive light, but it's almost overly done.	1
	could it be that its portrayal here was influenced by the reception to the way opus dei was treated in _davinci code_?      	1
	old wine is a not so new bottle.don't get me wrong.. this book is a sure page turner.. but if you have read the da vinci code, this one is just the same.	1
	only set in d.c. more code breaking and running.. dan brown intersperses hot paced action with some lectures on symbols.sometimes you just want to turn the page and go the action sequence!...	1
	the puzzles are not as engrossing as da vinci code.. but the authour's tour of d.c. is impressive... i also wondered how a man whose hand was severed could go on helping crack symbols as if nothing had happened!	1
	masonry perhaps!	1
	:) the book looks to be written just for a movie.	1
	you can almost visualise tom hanks in the movie.. beware tom tlv is going to be difficlt :)      	1
	the trilogy is completed.	1
	move on..you had to have this third novel to complete the trilogy for hollywood to produce.	1
	it was an okay read, but i spotted the plot twist the minute it was introduced (when the background of the antagonist is introduced).	1
	i felt it borrowed from another famous novel by an author with the initials a.d., but twists that plot in the only other way you really can.	1
	dan brown has developed a captivating style which i think has now been fully explored and won't work again.	1
	i would even have to agree with most that it barely worked this time.	1
	if this novel had come out before the davinci code, it would have been better as this novel will not generate the same level of controversy.	1
	i would agree it's better than angels & demons, but below davinci code.	1
	i'll also agree i'm glad i only bought the kindle version (thanks for letting me borrow yours, dwayne!).	1
	guess it'll be in theaters at the end of 2010. in the end the movie trilogy will be just like the matrix, starts off with the best idea and just goes downhill from there.      	1
	couldn't put it down.as a fan of the da vinci code - i was eagerly anticipating dan brown's newest novel.	1
	i admit, the opening sequences were great, and since i live in washington dc i have been to all of the places brown describes in the book.	1
	i admit i discovered new facts about he city that i have lived near for over 20 years and it intrigued me to actually google and confirm several of the facts related in the book.	1
	the story was definately a page turner until the final scenes -possible spoiler!- the ending was a bit long after we solved the mystery of the pyramid.	1
	i know the religous angle was important but seemed a to drag a bit talking about how we are made in god's image - the divinity - etc.      	1
	very disappointed.i bought this book for my wife for christmas.	1
	we have both read all of his previous books and loved them.	1
	she said half way through she was struggling to be able to finish it and i only made it half way through before i just got to bored to finish it. 	1
	brown's agenda is anti-christian, pro-new age.dan brown has had a very definite agenda in his last several books, one that is decidedly anti-christian and pro-new age.	1
	'the lost symbol' is no exception, and in fact, is even more blatant in some ways than 'the da vinci code'.	1
	i'm actually surprised that some readers believed this book would not offend christians and, furthermore, thought that its conclusion was an embrace of christianity.	1
	in truth, brown deceptively tries to undermine basic christian beliefs by taking biblical scriptures out of context and saying they prove that we can be gods ourselves, if only we could harness the full potential of our minds.	1
	this is a dangerous new age belief that has nothing in common with christianity.	1
	he also states that all religions commonly share the same truth, which is that we can be gods, and that armageddon is not the end of the world but rather a period of enlightenment in which we finally realize our potential to be god-like.	1
	christianity teaches us that there is only one god, who sent his son jesus (fully god and fully man) to save us from our sins because we can't save ourselves, and that the only way to salvation is through a personal belief in and relationship with jesus (john 3:16, john 14:6).	1
	new age believers want to convince us that all roads lead to heaven, but god himself, through scripture, says otherwise.	1
	one additional point:  people have complained about the annoying plot device brown uses repeatedly in which his protagonist, robert langdon, refuses to believe unlikely ideas or myths until a few pages later when they are always proven to be true.	1
	while this device quickly becomes tedious, i think brown may be using it for a more deceptive purpose:  if the protagonist, a well-educated intellectual, can be wrong about his religious beliefs, perhaps the reader will wonder if he or she might be also.	1
	it is an overly amateurish concept and yet, perhaps through repetition, it is effective enough to actually cause some christians to question their basic beliefs.	1
	don't let dan brown's new age beliefs fool you.  	1
	can't wait for his next work.definitely the clearest in dan brown's theme of a spirituality all can embrace with optimism about the possibility of melding a world peace based on understanding of a common thread between religious zealots that distort the great spiritual message of each tradition, all in a compelling page to page turner that i was sorry was over.	1
	hope he continues in this vein.	1
	the criticism of others that langdon is short sighted is earned by his refusal to be open to a spiritual reality outside the confines of science, just because he can't prove it.	1
	a must read.      	1
	the lost symbol lost on many....as i was reading other reviews for this book i was shocked.	1
	i will not use big words to describe why i think this book is amazing i will only offer my humble opinion.	1
	in a world filled with bad reviews a good review is needed.	1
	dan brown's books are refreshing in that while they can get rather lengthy they grab you from page one and keep you wanting more.	1
	yes he uses a lot of descriptive language but for me this only allows me to better picture in my mind the plot and setting.	1
	also, dan brown sticks to what he knows works he uses a recurring character, robert langdon, gives langdon a symbol related problem that takes him all over particular cities, pairs him with a female sidekick, and offers an offhand twist to something based in religion.	1
	to me brown's fast paced books are extraodinary in that he really challenges you to think about things in a different light.	1
	personally i find his logic hard not to believe.	1
	at the end of the day i consider what his logic has handed me and i wonder 'what would the world be like if this were true?'.	1
	all i can say is if you are bored with brown's repetitive style quit picking up his books.	1
	i for one hope there will be another langdon novel because i believe there is much more for him to learn.       	1
	lost symbol entertaining and thought provoking.lost symbol is a real page turner.	1
	the story is well paced although it does get a bit wordy in the middle.	1
	also at times the story gets rather jumbled between past and present.	1
	that said, the setting of washington d.c. is genius.	1
	considering our economic times, what better way to get americans more interested in the history of their country.	1
	the story ends with our hero robert langdon saving the day of course.	1
	however, the readers own interpretation of the story begins the last fifty pages.	1
	the final chapters will provoke deep thought and controversy.	1
	but then, that is what has made dan brown famous!	1
	a must read for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.      	1
	lame to the 33rd degree.i pre-ordered this book for delivery on my kindle and was looking forward to reading it.	1
	i found it disappointing.	1
	the story was formulaic and seemed to be a beleaguered attempt at reliving brown's past glories with the da vinci code.	1
	conflating covering up repulsive arcane rituals performed by powerful men with saving democracy for people who are too stupid to understand the symbolism of the rituals???	1
	concealing our beloved leaders' behavior is an issue of national security???	1
	really!	1
	it seems to me that concealing the behavior of these powerful men from us has been the biggest threat to democracy.	1
	the idea that noetic 'science' is a route to powerful improvement to the human condition - ridiculous.	1
	thoughts don't weigh grams or ounces and wishful thinking doesn't accomplish anything.	1
	i was never able to suspend my disbelief and felt that i was being lectured by a devout radical.	1
	this book was not worth the time it took to read it.         	1
	it took 6 years to write this?.i'm not going to write a lot here -- i'm going to keep it simple.	1
	i kept waiting for the plot to improve -- it didn't.	1
	i waiting for the ending to make up for it -- it didn't.	1
	i believed the hype and build-up for this book and bought it the instant it was available.	1
	that won't happen on the next book.      	1
	don't waste your time,.dan should go away some place, count his money and stop writing.	1
	doesn't deserve even one star.      	1
	lame.	1
	save your money..this book has no depth.	1
	i found i didn't care about any of the characters anywhere in the book.	1
	worse, i kept seeing tom hanks as the lead.	1
	this book was on a par with hannibal.	1
	there really is a need for editors.	1
	save your money.	1
	if you can't pass entirely, borrow it from the library.      	1
	yet another fantastic read.i actually pre-ordered the hard-cover version of this book and paid full price for it ... and i have no regrets.	1
	dan brown has done it again and this, along with the da vinci code and angels and demons soars head and shoulders above digital fortress.	1
	it's as twisted and history-meets-theory enriched as the rest with a new, compelling and equally creepy villain to match.	1
	i was slightly disappointed to find far fewer puzzles to be solved in this book, with the others i enjoyed pausing during the read to try and figure out the puzzle or clue before langdon and his sidekick of the hour could do it for me.	1
	in this novel there were really only one or two puzzles to be solved but the eye opening inclusion of interesting scientific studies briefly cusped in this tomb has led me on a path of insatiable reading pleasure long after i closed the lost symbol and placed it in its new home upon my shelf.	1
	well worth the price i paid and by far worth the cost of the kindle version.      	1
	masturbatory material for the non-existent mind!.i just finished the book.	1
	i have never seen such a load of rubbish in my life.	1
	i never thought i would hear anything more stupid than intelligent design ever, but apparently i was wrong.	1
	the psudo-philosophical arguments among characters in this book are not intelligible enough to fool a four-year-old.	1
	this is a prime example of  what goes as a literary work in our times when a book like this sells so much.	1
	and, for those who want to claim that this work has its own virtues since it is entertaining: no, it is not!	1
	i was jumping paragraphs at the end to get this finished as quickly as humanly possible.	1
	i am glad i never paid a penny for this book!      	1
	please stop.this book was a huge disappointment.	1
	the plot was thin, the characters one dimensional, and the writing poor.	1
	in addition, brown seems to have bought into a lot of the psychic nonsense that has been disproven over and over.	1
	no one has replicated the psychokinetic 'experiments' at princeton.	1
	out of body nonsense has been discredited, etc.	1
	we don't need this.	1
	i hope brown enjoys his ill gotten gains.        	1
	worth reading.	1
	'lost symbol' is dan brown's fifth novel and third featuring harvard symbologist robert langdon.	1
	he's jack bauer in a tweed coat.	1
	lost symbol takes a slight departure from the other langdon tomes; instead of skirting all around europe, all of the action takes place in washington, dc.	1
	the ideology that gets the dan brown treatment are the freemasons.	1
	i liked the book.	1
	lost symbol is fast-paced and is a rapid page turner at several junctures.	1
	the freemason stuff and historical info about washington dc is interesting.	1
	the arch-villain, mal'ach is a much more intriguing character than the ones in 'davinci code' and 'angels and demons.'	1
	the plot is also not cluttered with layers and layers of traitors and double-crossers as in the other two langdon novels.	1
	the plot twist near the end of the book is a doozy.	1
	as good as it was, there are some things i didn't care for.	1
	the langdon formula gets wearisome.	1
	you get the impression that if robert langdon was in peril and he came across a sunday new york times crossword puzzle, robert langdon would have it filled out in a span of a minute.	1
	some of the symbology mysteries and their resolution border on the 'are you kidding me?'	1
	variety.	1
	the plot has some holes in it.	1
	for example, the cia operatives ineptitude borders on the keystone cops or something.	1
	it seems like the book went 20 pages too long.	1
	the anticipated 'big ending' of something truly mystical just never transpires.	1
	but all said, dan brown is our most important author of this decade.	1
	his long awaited release is well worth reading.         	1
	almost as good as da vinci code, just not quite..brown clearly has mastered his technique of weaving arcane history with symbolism, and a fun, face paced story.	1
	and he manages to do a great job of leaving his readers feel like they are themselves involved in solving the puzzles that brown presents in his stories.	1
	in many ways, this book is a worthy successor to his da vinci code.	1
	it's just not quite as good.	1
	this is in part because -- like his earlier work deception point -- he has his characters go through too many implausible scenarios.	1
	in ways that his craft improved by simplifying the action in da vinci, he regressed by doing too much again in lost symbols.	1
	similarly (and i will not reveal any of the plot or resolution here), the 'threat' that his lead characters were working to prevent seemed silly to the point of being non-threatening.	1
	to be sure, it's revelation would have harmed a handful of people.	1
	but it hardly rose to the level of damage as that which could have befallen the entire catholic church like the scenario laid out in da vinci.	1
	so while i enjoyed this book almost as much as da vinci code, it did not represent an improvement in his writing.	1
	it's as if brown had not learned or improved since his last book.	1
	if anything, he regressed a bit.	1
	ah well, the book still has 'film script' written between every line, and should do well in theaters (despite another lame performance by tom hanks).	1
	and if it gets people interested in learning more about us history, then it deserve whatever praise it can get.	1
	even with some minor shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable read.      	1
	i expected better..there are some very long reviews here, but i will try to keep this simple.	1
	the premise of the book is based on a very new age philosophy that the reader and main character have trouble believing.	1
	the story relies on too many coincidences and 'oh i just realized/remembered' to be believable.	1
	one of the major plot points is based on a character not sharing information until late in the book that they very easily could have shared at the beginning and had no reason not to.	1
	ultimately this reads more like national treasure than the da vinci code except without the humor.      	1
	entertaining and a good read, but unsatisfying ending.having read several other dan brown books, this one keeps pace with the others.	1
	it's a good book, and it keeps you reading along anxiously awaiting the next revelation.	1
	i would definitely recommend it, but it's nowhere near as satisfying as some of the prior books.	1
	the whole book leads you up towards some huge revelation, and then it just drops you off with one of the worst written endings ever.	1
	it's worse than a cliffhanger, as you get an ending that is just sadly disappointing.	1
	it's as if dan brown had this great idea for a book, and how to build the suspense, but couldn't think of any big mystery to solve.	1
	again, i'd still recommend the book, but was hoping for something more.      	1
	blue's clues.did anyone else feel like dialog with langdon was like watching an episode of blue's clues?	1
	there are words in the english language that have multiple meanings...imagine that...apparently that is really difficult for our genius professor to grasp.	1
	overall the book was a major disappointment.	1
	it was entertaining at points, and a few of the pot twists actually did surprise me.	1
	but the dialog was painful and the plot was formulaic.	1
	the ending of the book made wish i hadn't wasted my time. 	1
	disappointing.i was very disappointed with dan brown's latest novel.	1
	the storyline was weak and the plot 'suprises' were predictable.	1
	i kept getting the impression that this book was written according to a formula based on his last two novels.	1
	he was simply capitalizing on his prior efforts.      	1
	the lost symbol.i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	this is my least favorite.	1
	the beginning & ending are slow.	1
	the middle does have the 'can't wait to read the next page' that his other books do.	1
	i guess i just had trouble grasping the concept in this book.       	1
	so painfully bad i just couldn't finish it..i loved the da vinci code.	1
	i devoured it in about two days.	1
	i never thought brown was hemmingway, but he seemed a master of dramatic pace and tension.	1
	i may yet finish reading the lost symbol some day.	1
	maybe i'll just skip to the end to see if anything ever happens.	1
	seriously, it took him how many years to write this?	1
	i don't think it's really dan brown's fault.	1
	he probably had one terrific editor for the da vinci code, someone who condensed his hundreds of aimless pages into a taunt thriller.	1
	sadly, that editor wasn't assigned this book.	1
	dan brown is probably too big for any underpaid editor to suggest that his prose needs a complete overhaul.	1
	but it is we the readers who must suffer ... bland cardboard characters who say tedious things over and over again with overused clichs ... entire chapters that do nothing to advance the plot ... a villain who is simply comical ... and a tailor-made central mystery that never seems to take off ... oh, and an iphone commercial early in the book!	1
	sadly, there's not an app to make this one more readable.	1
	so glad i only paid $9.99 for the e-book!      	1
	disappointing....i eagerly awaited the arrival of my copy of 'the lost symbol' and quickly finished the book i had been reading, in anticipation of a great story.	1
	unfortunately, i am left feeling as though i'm done with dan brown books, for good.	1
	'da vinci code' was my first dan brown book & also my favorite.	1
	'angels and demons' was a good read, but i was slightly disappointed in the monotony of the formula.	1
	it was flat out tiresome by the time i finished with 'the lost symbol'.	1
	several other reviews discuss the disappointment with the end of the book in some detail... and i fully agree with most assessments & won't repeat the analysis here.	1
	of course, there is a sect of the population that will fall in love with this book because of the ending.	1
	imo, the entire premise of this book is a slick attempt by dan brown to extend his reach to the audience that had previously opposed his novels.	1
	this drastic shift in audience is likely to create even more controversy, publicity & ultimately- more sales.	1
	the 2 star rating (as opposed to 1) was given because the book is a 'page-turner'.	1
	although toward the end, the motivation for my page-turning was to bring the misery to an end, and a not reflection of a thrilling plot. 	1
	riveting and disappointing at the same time.i couldn't put the book down.	1
	dan brown knows how to write a suspenseful story, with plenty of surprises--so many that, ironically, i began to anticipate some of them.	1
	the symbols and 'puzzles' relating to art and architecture were fun, and i was able to decipher some of them.	1
	but...impossible that so much could happen in a 10-hour span, and even more impossible that mere mortals could endure physically the trials they undergo in that time period.	1
	i could have done with about 100 fewer pages and far fewer 'philosopical' passages.	1
	i caught on to the big message quite early in the game.	1
	still, i've read books that have far less to offer!       	1
	the lost 'formula'..mr. brown's 'formula' for book writing is alive and well.	1
	too bad his plots are not.	1
	an interesting read with a few twists and turns, but the ending was disappointing.	1
	as a freemason, i had to laugh at times.	1
	it's obvious that whoever mr. brown got his masonic information from either didn't tell him correctly, or it was too boring to write about without much 'embellishment'.	1
	too much like 'dune' and not enough like 'indiana jones'.	1
	it could have been so much better.	1
	overall i give it two (2) stars.	1
	not dan's best work.was looking forward to this for a 'revelation' of masonic rites and practices.	1
	dan seems to have bowed to grovelling to the masons.	1
	a rather long, and convoluted plot with little resolution at the end.	1
	hopefully his next work will turn in a different direction.      	1
	once you've read one, you've read them all.having read two of dan brown's books, i was excited for this new one.	1
	however, i am completely disappointed.	1
	it reads just like his other books but he's created a 'formula' for writing.	1
	nothing new in the lost symbol--same characters, twists, and turns.	1
	the plot is way too predictable.      	1
	too dark.why did the author feel he had to go all 'super evil' with his villan.	1
	his other works have been great.	1
	maybe it's just the trend, and the publishers are saying this is what sells, but i thought it degraded the book from the others.	1
	i was disappointed.	1
	otherwise an okay book.      	1
	mixed bag.i almost rated this a '4' because it is definitely a page turner and it does contain a lot of interesting arcana and a moderate albeit superficial dose of interesting scientific and philosophical/religious ideas.	1
	on the other hand, brown's writing style grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard (i don't remember the davinci code being that way...although it may have been.)	1
	all the italics, all the internalized questions, overuse of words like 'chuckled' and 'd.c.,' cliff hanging chapter after cliff hanging chapter, the droning preachiness at the end.....it was all a bit much for my taste.	1
	and finally, i never did buy into why everyone including the cia thought the incident was so earthshaking.	1
	in the final analysis though, who am i to criticize dan brown and his writing?	1
	this book cashed out more in its first day than i will in a lifetime.	1
	it just could have been a lot more satisfying.   	1
	great bedtime reading...bores you to right to sleep.this book is great bedtime reading...if you ever have trouble with insomnia, it will bore you right to sleep.	1
	i admit i bought into the pre-sale hype for this book.	1
	i loved the davinci code, angels and demons, and deception point, and so i eagerly anticipated brown's newest release.	1
	what a let down!	1
	i trudged through the first 100 pages--and literally fell asleep at least a half-dozen times.	1
	kept thinking it had to get better, so i started 'speed reading' through the next 400 (still not willing to give up on it entirely).	1
	i think maybe brown's contract stipulated a per-page payment, because there was soooo much repetition and completely unnecessary drivel!	1
	i am so glad i got this book from the library (first on the reserve list for months) and didn't actually purchase it, so at least i only wasted my time and not my money!      	1
	disappointing and confusing.i've read every dan brown book and eagerly snapped this one up on day one.	1
	sorry, have to say, what a disappointment.	1
	it has none of the punch, excitement and cliff hanging story that his other books have had.	1
	i can honestly say you never have to worry about when to put the book down for a break.	1
	there's an opportunity at every page.	1
	reads like a metaphysical schoolbook filled with confusing jargon and unless you are a real devotee of the masons and their mystical history you'll be lost.      	1
	if you have absolutely nothing else to read.i've read and enjoyed all of dan brown's previous books, especially the davinci code.	1
	the only thing that could keep me even continuing to read this book was brown's detailed descriptions of the masonic symbols.	1
	other than that; the science, the plot, the character interaction, combined to make this one of the most quickly forgettable books that i've ever read.	1
	i will anticipate brown's next book with far more trepidation than i did this book.       	1
	not a lost cause.i don't think that there can be much serious debate about whether or not this is a horrible book.	1
	it is.	1
	but that does not necessarily mean that it's a total waste of time.	1
	it may be that the lost symbol will be the means to prove, once and for all, if the premise behind the idea of noetic science has any basis in fact at all.	1
	if it does then the tens of thousands of people around the world who bought the book and are wishing that they had their money back will be getting a check in the mail any day now.      	1
	bored to tears.this is more of a take on how i am feeling about reading the book than a review.i don't even know if it is right or fair for me to give my opinion at this point since i am only up to chapter 25. it is just sooooooo boring to me that i can't seem to even want to pick it up and continue reading; it has yet to grab my attention.	1
	i keep walking by it and think i should sit down and finish reading it because it might get better but my gut feeling is it won't.	1
	i have read a lot of reviews on this and other sites and most reveiws confirm my gut feeling.	1
	since i paid good money for it guess i will try and plod my way through but if you haven't bought it yet and still would like to read it i suggest you not waste your money,  check it out from the library or wait for it to come out in paperback at a half priced book store.	1
	to think i was looking so forward to reading this book that i bought it before i asked my friends who bought and read it what they thought.	1
	wish i had waited, could have used the money on something more worthwhile.        	1
	a fair read.i really like robert langdon as a character -- the way he is knowledgeable yet humble, secure in his beliefs yet willing to accept other's.	1
	having said that i just did not get the feeling of 'urgency' -- the life and death in the balance that i had with angels and demons and da vinci code.	1
	the science in the book was a little much in my opinion.	1
	kind of hard for me to get inot-- that may have had something to do with my opinion.	1
	it was a decent read, just not great.       	1
	unoriginal and contrived.i wasn't too surprised to find that brown wrote yet another book in the same style as before.	1
	this book had the typical langdon quest to track something down while solving a puzzle after a stream of brilliant deductions that he was able to come up with quickly and while under pressure.	1
	it had the usual good guys and bad guys and people who might have been one or the other but one couldn't really be sure.	1
	and in the end, something or somebody isn't what it had appeared to be.	1
	despite that, brown managed to make things work in the past by having good story lines and far fetched circumstances that one could have accepted as possible given the situation.	1
	this time, things were such a stretch that i still cannot imagine the most insane person ending up in the role of this novel's villain.	1
	a real person can be brilliant, yet sometimes miss things.	1
	when it's not a real person, an author must figure out what the main character could conceivably overlook that would be accepted by the readership.	1
	in angels and demons, i thought it was a stretch that langdon did not find it obvious that a symbol he was looking at was a mirror image.	1
	in this book, we are expected to believe that langdon's unmatched talents for decoding symbols could leave him drawing a blank because he could not tell that something was upside down.	1
	in this novel, the cia has a top person looking into things for some unknown reason.	1
	this person is supposed to be such a super spy that she knows everything that anybody anywhere is doing.	1
	it's never made clear in the book why it would be a legitimate cia affair, unless you accept that they can run amok for their own benefit.	1
	but more importantly, we find out that much of the knowledge that this character has comes from a pre-existing wiretap of somebody's cell phone.	1
	yet after a day of monitoring things, a text message gets sent from that phone that would have presented the opportunity for the cia to end the entire problem almost instantly while averting another disaster.	1
	if there had been some explanation why they had missed it, perhaps i would have understood.	1
	but it never came up.	1
	even if that character could have overlooked something so obvious, could her entire staff of top level cia operatives have monitored phone calls and voice mail for the phone but missed a text message?	1
	i don't think so.	1
	this same person was aware of a different text message that nobody could have possibly known about.	1
	go figure.	1
	if langdon initially got fooled into something by never confirming the legitimacy of a phone message, is it credible that other highly intelligent leading characters would also act based on an unconfirmed phone call, or accept a text message at face value or fail to look at one from a phone that is being monitored?	1
	how many times can people make the same mistake?	1
	several times in the story, brown wanted to mislead readers into thinking something else.	1
	so he did it by saying that something else happened.	1
	then later he says that that wasn't what really happened.	1
	spoiler alert.	1
	we are supposed to believe that a son who is not willing to follow in his father's footsteps but is willing to take untold millions of dollars in inheritance is not smart enough to get out of a jam on his own.	1
	his father could have taken the dishonest path by bribing somebody, but the son is too stupid to figure out on his own that he could have bribed someone.	1
	just when you think the son should be able to figure that out, you are told that something else happens.	1
	it would have required the son to be stupid and to have shot off his mouth to an impossible extent for what followed.	1
	it would have made no sense for a jail guard never to have asked for a bribe or for him to go along with a tenuous plan involving a third party that would have been simple had the son been involved instead.	1
	we are then expected to believe that a father's honesty which would have left his son in jail for another day or so for something the son did wrong would be considered such an outrage that the son would be willing to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge, killing off his whole family, trying to destroy the entire nation, even though doing so would involve learning everything he eschewed in the first place, but to a much further level, and would be accompanied by so much other learning, preparation, and untold endeavors.	1
	he would have to study arcane aspects of religion, culture, and philosophy to get away with it.	1
	he would also have to miss the entire message of everything he learned along the way and never have the thought that any pain his father might have caused was insignificant compared to the literal pain he brought upon himself afterward.	1
	by literal, i mean literal.	1
	the biggest reason for any outrage over the father's actions was supposedly that it lead to the death of his son.	1
	but his son could not have gotten outraged for that reason since he never died and was never in danger of dying.	1
	and had he died, he would not have been outraged since he would have been dead.	1
	had the reader believed he had died, then the reader would have needed to believe that the person outraged by the death was the person who did the killing.	1
	such a person would have been more likely to have been grateful for the opportunity, given the wealth he obtained by doing so.	1
	in the end brown wants you to think the thing you ruled out in the beginning, accepting that a family was never asked to identify a body and that law enforcement was fine with that, and that brown's explicit statements were supposed to have been interpreted as 'it seemed as if...' are all a mistake on your part.	1
	i'm sure i'm not the only person who read through those paragraphs a second time before continuing with the book just to be sure things weren't happening in the obvious way.	1
	but in the end, we find out that at least that part really did happen in the obvious way.	1
	as to the big mystery of life that the quest was supposed to reveal, brown would have been better off ending the book earlier with the message that the secrets were once again safe where they belonged.	1
	that would have been fine with langdon who never cared about such secrets in the first place.	1
	instead, langdon persists until his once again super sharp cryptographic skills allow him to unlock a secret that was not really a secret to the people who were keeping it a secret, and nothing more than something that is already a common viewpoint among many.	1
	a final point is that if you kill of langdon too early in the book, readers will know it didn't make any sense.	1
	just because you said he was dead didn't mean he was dead.	1
	it meant you wanted us to think so, and later you want us to say 'i guess i was wrong.	1
	i never saw it coming that he might be alive somehow.'	1
	things like that took all the suspense out of it.	1
	and since langdon was left alive, we are all left waiting for that next sequel.       	1
	absolutely awful.	1
	didn't even bother reading to the end..the dvc was great fun.	1
	not literature, not always believable - but hey its fiction and was a great ride.	1
	this book is terrible.	1
	over the top attempt at dark mysticism... bland re-hash of dc tourist sites... its like db took a guidebook and came up with a (very) lazy plot in an afternoon.	1
	there are plenty of other reviews that go into the details of why this book is so terrible, so no need to repeat.	1
	save your $$$s.	1
	if you must, buy 2nd hand, or wait for the cheap paperbacks to come out.       	1
	perhaps one of the worst book i have ever read.dan brown should join james patterson, jodi picoult and other writers who create the same book time after time, with a genre that does nothing but insult a curious mind.	1
	perhaps i am guilty of continuing to read what is really written for the uneducated.       	1
	much ado about nothing.on a flight from rome to dc this book was my companion.	1
	it was engaging until the last portion, when i realized that the foundation for the entire plot was extremely wanting and the expenditure of my time was unsatisfying.	1
	the idea is pitiful that a new age of world peace will usher upon us all based on the breaking of a wax seal on an old box, or knowing that a bible is under a cornerstone of the washington memorial, or knowing that there can be multiple layers of meaning in the bible, or knowing that there can be divinity in each of us.	1
	there is really nothing new or earthshaking about any of these ideas.	1
	likewise, the idea that many top leaders of our nation would risk their lives to protect the big secret, that a copy of the bible is under a cornerstone, is absurd.	1
	while quiet medication (as brown presents the masonics to practice) is probably helpful for most, busy people hardly have time to place life-and-death priority on protecting secrets that are no secrets at all.	1
	even if brown goals was to slam the masonics as preoccupied with secrets of no significance (and i am not a masonic), the best i can say about this book is 'much ado about nothing.'	1
	read your bible.that's the message of the lost symbol, and you're better off taking dan brown's advice than reading his hardly worthwhile novel with its disapointing reveals.	1
	the plot amounts to a sicko freemason taking on the cia in a race to find legendary ancient secrets hidden somewhere in washington d.c., robert langdon leading the way in an attempt to save his captive mentor.	1
	this being my introduction to dan brown mania (i've never read one of his books before), i was shocked by the shoddiness of the writing coming from a megaseller.	1
	i can't remember meeting characters with this level of niavete.	1
	they are ready to believe every phone call, text message, and disguise used by the manipulative villian.	1
	the thrill is gone when all you can do is feel sorry for the disendowed protagonists.	1
	the writing is also jarringly repetitious.	1
	the same descriptions and plot points are reiterated by one character after another.	1
	the facts and figures accumulated from brown's long years of research predating this book show up in paragraphs that break any flow of suspence, and stimulated my mind only to the extent that i wondered how much was real and how much was embellished.	1
	brown also needs to understand that stating something happened from one persons point of view and later stating it happened another way from a different point of view feels more like a cheat than a plot twist.	1
	its just misleading and doesn't amount to a satisfying pay-off.	1
	as it is a follow up to the the da vinci code, the merit of which i can not vouch for, the lost symbol will sell well.	1
	that must testify to success of da vinci at least creating a desire for more dan brown.	1
	unfortunately, the lost symbol does not satiate.      	1
	not only stupid but dangerous.i won't repeat what many have pointed out - how idiotic the plot is and how poor the writing is.	1
	i am still not even sure what the big secret was supposed to be - a hidden bible?	1
	however, even though most of us understand that this is a work of fiction i am afraid that some ill-informed people are going to believe the utter crap about energy fields and faith healing and forgo proven therapies believing that there is 'noetic science' evidence for such garbage.	1
	it makes no real difference to human beings if someone believes that jesus had offspring but if someone believes that prayer or a faith healer can cure his or her offspring of a serious bacterial infection easily treated by antibiotics that is something else.	1
	i wish i had spent the time reading science-based medicine and suggest that anyone gullible enough to believe anything in this book do the same.      	1
	what has happened to this entertaining writer?.thank goodness i bought this book on kindle .	1
	it saved me a bit of money anyway.	1
	so disappointing i couldn't finish going through all those black tunnels with poor claustrophobic langdon.	1
	i hope he made it out ok.  but by 49% (kindle location--it doesn't give pages) i couldn't go on.	1
	and the punctuation.	1
	how original.	1
	can sentences end with not one but two punctuation marks?!	1
	should be an easy switch to a movie though. 	1
	not worth the wait (or the hefty price)!.the best thing dan brown has done for the world of literature is to spawn a legion of authors following in his footsteps of intelligent, historical/end-of-the world fiction tales.	1
	unfortunately, for brown, several of these authors (steve berry, james rollins, lynn sholes & joe moore, brad thor, etc.)	1
	have far surpassed him in creating engaging, page-turning fiction within this genre.	1
	brown's first three novels were brilliant - 'digital fortress', 'deception point' and 'angels & demons' - he was on pace to becoming the new michael crichton (the ability to write intelligent fiction that required constant use of an encyclopedia to truly enjoy the reading experience).	1
	regretably, his last novel - 'the davinci code' was so dumbed-down for mass consumption that you had to second-guess the identity of the author.	1
	the novel only received hype and ridiculous sales success due to the controversial subject matter.	1
	let's face it, the christian world does not stand for anyone threatening their story of jesus.	1
	global best-selling powerhouses like king and rushdie dismissed brown's 'davinci code' as being both trite and trash.	1
	i thought that was a bit harsh and, like millions of other readers, looked forward to his next work.	1
	is 'the lost symbol' worth the wait?	1
	in a simple word - no!	1
	robert langdon is at it again - this time, racing through the catacombs of the capitol building and other washington d.c. landmarks in an effort to figure out the symbolic secrets hidden within the masonic temple.	1
	when landgon's best friend, peter solomon, is captured and has his hand cut off by a full-body tatooed lunatic known only as mal'akh, he is on a race against time to decipher the symbolic code for the 'baddie' in order to save his friend's life.	1
	what follows, for over 500+ pages, is mind-numbingly boring and not at all exciting.	1
	in fact, brown is reduced to the james patterson idiotic technique of ultra-short chapters (some no more than a paragraph long) with each one ending in a pseudo-cliffhanger.	1
	i had to keep checking the jacket photo to ensure that this was, indeed, a dan brown novel and not written by team patterson.	1
	the mysteries of the masons are, quite frankly, not very interesting and ground that has been covered by nicolas cage in the horrible 'national treasure' films.	1
	you would have more excitement reading the back of a u.s. dollar bill!	1
	the only highlight in the book is when the actual identity of mal'akh is revealed (however outlandish and unrealistic it is).	1
	the book ends with so much religious & new age mumbo-jumbo i felt preached to rather than walking away enlightened.	1
	the only thing lost with 'the lost symbol' is the $30 i paid for the book and the nights of tiresome reading i subjected myself to in finishing this dreck!      	1
	just plain dull.i've read all of dan brown's book.	1
	got it as a pre-order on my kindle.	1
	i don't think i'll ever finish it.	1
	nasty stuff that was so unnecessary, too long, too boring.	1
	i loved the stuff about the masons - because that is a family thing, but that wasn't enough to make this a worth while read.	1
	i think someone must have given this man poor advise.	1
	i think i'll go back and re-read one of his earlier ones.      	1
	lost symbol = lost money.i can't believe i wasted my money and bought this book.	1
	i loved angels and demons, and i thought davinci code was pretty good, but this book was just terrible.	1
	a dumbed down recycling of his past books.	1
	please, save yourselves the money, and if you still really really want to read lost symbol, just check it out from the library.	1
	i wish i had.      	1
	skip it or pick up at the library.i wanted to like this book.	1
	of dan brown's books my favorite is angels and demons.	1
	lost symbol lacks suspense.	1
	as others did, i figured out bad guy early on or so called major twist.	1
	no surprises but lots of long explanations .	1
	the funniest part to me was after being kidnapped up all night etc-peter 'solomon' (really- how obvious with the name ) has the energy to go all around dc and show langdon where the lost word is???.	1
	book is just plain silly with not enough character buildup or any payoff at all.	1
	skip it.      	1
	when will it end?.i'll admit it--i liked angels and demons a lot, even liked the da vinci code.	1
	sure they were formulaic and not particularly well-written, but they were fun, full of conspiracy-nut factoids, and had a plot that moved along.	1
	the lost symbol, on the other hand, is deathly dull and predictable, with a tattooed murderer (yawn) who holds secret information (when you see what it is, double yawn) and who wanders around d.c. in makeup and a silk diaper.	1
	robert langdon is impossibly stupid, regardless of how many times the other characters say 'professor langdon is so smart.'	1
	worst of all, it's about 100 pages too long, because of badly conceived and executed subplots, trips inside each character's stream-of-consciousness, and unnecessary short chapters in which various interchangeable characters will say something about their interchangeable confusion and dread, just so we know they're confused.	1
	as if we couldn't tell.	1
	in short: supposedly smart people miss obvious things as they wander around in the basement for six hours.	1
	masons are involved.	1
	read the bible.	1
	the end.       	1
	underwhelming.i read the davinci code years after its heyday, found it pretty entertaining, but did not think it lived up to the hype.	1
	i did not read the next book.	1
	i decided to give the lost symbol a fair shake.	1
	i thought the lost symbol had a creaky plot, with confusing parts and implausible parts the glue and string that held it together, albeit not very well.	1
	it needed more editing, to rein in some of the long-winded exposition parts, and to inject some degree of credibility into the action and pivotal events.	1
	an awful lot happens in about six hours.	1
	when you finally learn what the supposed crisis is, you wonder what the heck is the big deal.	1
	i'm trying not to give away any plot details, but to convey my view that, aside from some of the historical trivia, this book was a bit of a chore to read, and i was glad when it was over.	1
	lost symbol- not so great.pretty hokey and anticlimactic.	1
	but, if you follow noetic sciences and are interested in masonic history you will find the majority of this book interesting from that perspective.	1
	dan brown really had the opportunity to turn this into a real indiana jones adventure but fell so flat.	1
	a disappointment since i wanted the thrills of the adventure.	1
	i wish it had ended with something earth shattering hidden in the corner stone!       	1
	'the mystery of the lost editor'.this book makes one appreciate a good editor because it's apparent that dan brown did not use one for 'the lost symbol.'	1
	although parts of the book are entertaining, overall i am disappointed in the book.	1
	i am especially disappointed because brown has the ability to write a first-class thriller; he only had to step off his bestseller pedestal and spend some quality time writing and consulting with his editor.	1
	unfortunately, it appears that somewhere along the way, brown or his publisher decided that time was of the essence and this book needed to be published 'as is.'	1
	unfortunately, this wasn't a wise decision.	1
	major parts of this book need editing, as so many other readers on this site have noted.	1
	what i personally found most disconcerting in 'the lost symbol' is how brown advances important parts of the story using plot devices that simply are unrealistic and unbelievable.	1
	i don't expect a thriller to be a literary masterpiece, but i do expect reasonable decisions to be made by the characters deemed intelligent by the author.	1
	two critical junctures in the book strained all credibility with me.	1
	*spoiler alert (plot details)**in the beginning of the book and in one of the first critical junctures, langdon agrees to go to washington d.c. at the last minute to make a speech for his friend and mentor, peter solomon--all without confirming the trip or the speech with peter directly.	1
	this part makes sense--almost any academic would enjoy a day trip to washington d.c. and the chance to revel in the luxury of a private plane, discourse on a topic close to one's heart, and perhaps even savor a quiet dinner.	1
	confirming these plans with 'peter's assistant' is certainly a reasonable response on langdon's part.	1
	what makes no sense is that langdon totes along a priceless artifact (one that imbues 'its possessor with the ability to bring order from chaos') that peter entrusted to him years ago.	1
	call me crazy but if i were jetting around the country with a priceless artifact, i'm pretty sure i would be confirming everything with the person who invited me.	1
	in fact, i might even be a wee bit obsessive about it!	1
	i promptly fell out of the story and into...music please...'the mystery of the lost editor.'	1
	in a second critical juncture, katherine solomon invites mal'akh(the bad guy)into her guarded, top-secret laboratory.	1
	she decides to trust mal'akh after she receives a text message from her brother, peter, vetting mal'akh.	1
	what makes no sense is that super-smart katherine doesn't question or confirm peter's text message--even though peter has never text-messaged her before.	1
	what makes her decision even more ridiculous is that katherine is worried about her brother prior to this text message; she hasn't heard from him and she's concerned about his whereabouts.	1
	what was brown thinking here when he wrote this?	1
	who in the world would let a stranger into a top-secret lab on the basis of a text message?	1
	i tumbled again into...music please...'the mystery of the lost editor.	1
	'**end of spoiler alert* dan brown doesn't know his audience very well if he doesn't realize that he can't bulldoze his way through a story without our noticing the bulldozer.	1
	characters' actions have to make sense in order for readers to suspend disbelief.	1
	this latest effort by brown is truly a disappointment.	1
	i don't think i will be rushing to order and pay for dan brown's next book.	1
	the waiting list at the library may suit me just fine.         	1
	predictable, wordy, melodramatic, & disappointing.let me preface by saying i've read all of dan brown's books and found them entertaining.	1
	i thought the writing and editing got progressively better in the order they were written with da vinci code being an impeccable thriller.	1
	unfortunately it is my guess that dan brown's former success has made his editor reluctant to critisize his work.	1
	all of dan brown's books are formulaic and this is no exception.	1
	similar plot lines and character sets from his former books give it a write-by-numbers feel.	1
	that by itself is not a problem.	1
	unfortunately it is also really, really predictable.	1
	i'll not spoil the book for you but lets just say there are no real surprises in there.	1
	additionally it seems that everything is said three times in this book.	1
	his endlessly reminding us of facts presented earlier in the book borders on condescending.	1
	this book could have easily been half as long.	1
	thirdly, if you loved da vinci code because it was just grounded enough to be plausible as i did, then this book is sure to disappoint.	1
	the technology and 'science' presented in the book is actually in the realm of metaphysics and dated science fiction.	1
	it pushes the book from gritty realistic thriller to fantasy and science fiction.	1
	don't get me wrong, i love a good science fiction book but it just doesn't work when you were expecting a nice historical puzzle wrapped in a grounded thriller.	1
	finally, the dialog is atrocious.	1
	the antagonist's dialog is melodramatic to the point of being unbelievable and for reasons i've yet to pinpoint, robert langdon (the protagonist), has gotten dumber and more annoying - but he's swimming a lot so at least he is staying fit.	1
	dan brown must also really hate college students because he portrays them as one-dimensional, dimwitted, and rude.	1
	maybe they are.	1
	it's not my recollection but i haven't been in college for a while.	1
	in short, this is not a book worth buying...      	1
	i wish i had the time back i've invested .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	.. .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	in reading 'the lost symbol' by dan brown.	1
	this book is not an adventure, its an exercise in tedium, staring many of your favorite, stock b-movie characters.	1
	truly, can we be expected to swallow the mean, secretive cia chief who appears like the female warden in a women's prison film?	1
	right down to the wrecked voice, chain smoking and every-other-sentence menancing threats.	1
	give that lady a truncheon and we're ready to go!	1
	if anyone was actually suprised with the true identity of the 'villian' here, please do not admit that fact to the outside world.	1
	you will just embarrass yourself.	1
	and while robert langdon is perported to be a scholar and teacher, he is incredibly closed-minded when confronted by 'new' data or ideas.	1
	this main character, who had something to do in previous novels, seems out of place and lost amongst the treasures of washington, dc.	1
	he appears most multi-dimensional in the brief passages recounting classes and forums.	1
	perhaps he should have an adventure at a major university instead.	1
	the writing lacks grace and flow, as did previous efforts 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons'.	1
	while a good storyteller can be forgiven a less than literary talent with language, a lack of story and constant re-hashing of information and (very bad) dialogue just shows a lack of skill and care.	1
	while i wish i had the cool million mr. brown raked in on the first day of 'the lost symbol', i hope i wouldn't be so cavalier about putting out a wordier version of a james patterson plus assistant writer story.	1
	as i neared the half-way point of this book, i really wanted someone to hit me on the head with a cap-stoned pyramid and get it over with.	1
	honestly, the idea behind this work is not worthly of 200 pages, let alone the number required to get to the end of this very disappointing offering.	1
	you are better off reading some nonfiction works regarding the freemasons if interested - many to choose from and not nearly as trying to read.	1
	last word to the wise (or anyone wanting entertainment), avoid this book.         	1
	craft-y but not crafty.as a thriller the book was moderately entertaining, even though some plot twists are hardly surprising, and the scavenger hunt gets tiresome at times.	1
	it is, however, necessary to completely suspend your disbelief.	1
	nevertheless, i could not really recommend the book to most readers.	1
	having been a defender of the first two robert langdon books, i expected this one to treat freemasonry with the same level of suspicion as it did christianity.	1
	i thought, for the sake of a good plot, it is all right to spin a yarn constructing a massive conspiracy theory that casts fairly innocent actions in a dubious light, especially if applied in equal measure to all your subjects.	1
	however, the veneration that langdon (as dan brown's voice) shows for freemasonry casts my former perspective into doubt.	1
	even practices that could very easily be portrayed as sinister are defended to such a degree that i fully expected a masonic membership application at the end of the book.	1
	i have to admit that i felt offended at times.	1
	the idea of drinking wine from a skull as opposed to a chalice during communion simply is not the same thing, no matter how often langdon claims it is symbolically identical.	1
	for these reasons, as well as the ludicrous brevity of many chapters and the outdated cliff-hanger style, i cannot award more than two stars.	1
	unsatisfying.the book ended leaving me very unsatisfied with the whole story at all.	1
	don't get me wrong, it is a page-turner.	1
	i couldn't put it down.	1
	but then towards the end, everything just falls apart.	1
	there is too much of one person lecturing another person.	1
	and the ending was just deflated totally.	1
	i wanted so much to like it, because it was set up well in the beginning, and it had a lot of potential.	1
	it went nowhere though and didn't satisfy the suspense it built. 	1
	a mediocre book.this book was a complete let-down for me.	1
	after da vinci code, i was expecting a richly detailed plot instead i gotlots of pseudo-religious symbolism and a completely obvious plot.	1
	this was the first dan brown book thati could have done without.	1
	i guess success makes people lazy.	1
	don't buy this book, just check it out from your local library.	1
	more predictable than before, but just as engrossing.the first dan brown book that i read was the davinci code.	1
	i enjoyed it a lot, enough to read angels and demons, which i liked even more.	1
	i went into this book expecting something similar, and wasn't disappointed in that respect.	1
	the plot was familiar enough, the pacing was faster, and the chapter cliffhangers were...well, omnipresent.	1
	i felt that the plot was weak.	1
	the other robert langdon books felt as if there was a specific goal in mind, and we knew the stakes from the middle, at least.	1
	in the lost symbol, we really only know the stakes in the last 50 or so pages.	1
	we're more emotionally involved in the characters than the plot, and when we do learn about the macguffin (aka plot device), it seems sort of shallow.	1
	we care, but only to the extent to which we care about a fraternity with which most people are unfamiliar.	1
	the science behind this novel is...interesting.	1
	i'm unfamiliar with noetic science, but i'm going to research it out of curiosity.	1
	if it has seen the results that dan brown talks about, i would be very surprised.	1
	i also don't know about the smithsonian complex that brown mentioned, but if it exists, i'd like to know more.	1
	i have saved the content of the mysteries until the end, because frankly, that's the major appeal of these books to me.	1
	in the interest of full disclosure, i should say that i am a freemason.	1
	my words and opinions are my own, and i do not speak for any other member, or for the fraternity as a whole, nor could anyone claim to.	1
	coming into this book, i was worried that masonry would be treated the way the illuminati were in angels and demons.	1
	as it turns out, i had nothing to worry about.	1
	dan brown was very respectful of the masonic institution.	1
	we were never denigrated, or viewed with a negative or suspicious light.	1
	even though the portrayals of our rituals (while incomplete, of course) were graphic, langdon explained the symbolism and allegory very well.	1
	if anything, after reading this book, a person who had questions about freemasonry would probably finish better educated.	1
	that being said, this was a source of fiction.	1
	if dan brown is excellent at any one thing, it is making you wonder where facts and fiction separate.	1
	i had never heard of many of the 'legends' mentioned.	1
	a conspiracy theorist would probably say that i'm just not in the right 'circles within circles'.	1
	as many other reviews have said, this is a novel, not literature.	1
	it is absolutely an entertaining read, and the continual cliffhangers made it difficult to find an excuse to stop reading.	1
	let go of your disbelief and enjoy the novel, because it is a fun way to spend your time.  	1
	the lost plot.i just finished reading this book.	1
	it wasn't easy because by about page 50, it was absolute nonsense.	1
	i mean really ridiculous stuff.	1
	aside from the huge plot holes and silly scenes of cia commandoes blowing down doors in the library of congress with magic explosives, or red dragon (oops, i mean mal'ach) running naked around washington dc to capture robert langdon, it was a quick read for your average junior high videogamer.	1
	i only finished this book out of spite after buying it to pass the time on a flight to paris.i feel like an abused wife who keeps blaming herself while expecting it to get better.      	1
	bits and pieces from brown's other books.like so many others, i hoped that this would be another fantastic episode in the life of robert langdon.	1
	it wasn't.	1
	the most distressing part of the book is that, unlike his previous books, brown presented virtually no history or mythology about his chosen subject (freemasonry and the united states) except occasional minutiae and internet-search trivia matched with his paternal narrative warnings not to judge the freemasons and their past.	1
	whose wandering opinions was brown trying to nanny back into check, ours or his?	1
	his pro-freemasonic lecturing got tedious to the point of insulting.	1
	don't look for anything but the most vague connection between freemasonry and the morgan affair, the mormon church, albert pike and his connection to confederate secret societies, or even the obvious, the founders.	1
	this book becomes brown's most violent yet.	1
	apparently he forgot how to write suspense and action into a scene without resorting to ripperological detail.	1
	finally, all but the last 100 pages are reminiscent of keystone cops antics.	1
	chasing, racing, stumbling, dark streets and confusion -- all without the usual langdon expertise to explain it.	1
	brown's lead character seems just as befuddled with his new mysteries and he is.	1
	meanwhile, the audience of readers resort to thinking for both gentlemen and silently scream 'don't go in there!'	1
	as well as 'don't write that!'	1
	the predictability of the book's plot is its undoing.	1
	void of any nuance between good and evil, simple and complex, or even fact and fiction, the readers are left to fend for themselves in a meaningless carnival of violence and moral lecturing.	1
	a more satisfying and sensible adventure would be to re-read an earlier brown book and mentally substitute 'freemason' for every reference to 'priory' and 'illimunati.'	1
	corn pone.what a colossal waste of time.	1
	boring, uninspired, trite and corny.	1
	save your money buy a comic book.      	1
	more bogus than usual.i'll think twice about buying anything published by doubleday.	1
	you'd think their editors and fact-checkers would have caught a lot of the stupidity.	1
	yes, it's a novel but many errors detract from the effect.	1
	brown is a total jerk for not even doing a google search or two to get his facts straight.	1
	plasma screens do not shrink to a pinpoint when they turn off.	1
	liquid hydrogen is stored in a dewar flask, not a cylinder.	1
	the cia is not permitted to do domestic operations, that's the fbi charter.	1
	a senior cia official who demands lethal force from a team on domestic soil against us citizens in a public building without a warrant??	1
	can't be that stupid.	1
	a scientist smart enough to have her own secret lab isn't dumb enough fall for the transparent lies told to her.	1
	digital fortress was full of gross errors, as were his other books.	1
	you'd think he would have learned from that.	1
	apparently not.	1
	at the list price, a huge waste.	1
	at the amazon price, still a waste of money.	1
	wait for it to show up in your local thrift store.	1
	two for a buck, maybe ok.      	1
	dan brown is your boring college professor.....remember your college professor who loved to hear himself talk?	1
	and kept forgetting he already told the class that really interesting story?	1
	that is dan brown and 'the lost symbol.'	1
	i read the enitre kindle version, just so i could say i read the whole damn boring book.	1
	i guess he will make a fortune, and the joke is on us.	1
	don't bother with this gibberish slab of masonic propaganda.	1
	if tom hanks agrees to star in the movie version of this book, he has certainly sold his soul to the devil.      	1
	surprisingly better than i thought it'd be.judging by other reviews, this book seems to average 2 or 3 stars.	1
	i'm giving it four, but based solely on this: the book is exactly what it's expected to be.	1
	it's not a great work of literature; it's not this elegantly crafted work of fiction which enlightens the soul and makes grown men cry.	1
	no, the book is exactly what i expected when i first heard about it: a fun, entertaining read filled with wild conspiracies and jumping plots and action and symbols and twisting, elaborate sub-plots that all culminate in a mostly-predictable yet still-thrilling tale of robert langdon.	1
	in a nutshell, it was fun!	1
	if we're judging this book on quality, then yeah, i'd give it two stars.	1
	maybe.	1
	if i was being generous.	1
	because it's not well written.	1
	the plot jumps too much, the characters are predictable and, at times, flat, and the book is so over-loaded with religious and government conspiracy that it makes you want to gag to think about.	1
	but this is exactly what anyone who's read brown before would expect going in.	1
	instead, i choose to focus on the fact that i started this book four hours ago, and stopped only briefly to eat (and watch some sunday night football!)	1
	before diving right back in.	1
	robert is in washington dc this time, after being tricked into the city by a madman who is seeking the key to knowledge and power, a secret that the freemasons are protecting at all costs.	1
	the plot takes place in just one night, and langdon jumps around dc as he races against the clock to save his mentor, who is being held hostage, and to unravel clue upon clue buried beneath the idea of the mason's pyramid, said to be a map to the greatest treasure in the country, all while dodging government agents out to stop him.	1
	brown definitely has a way with plot.	1
	while the plot was mostly predictable (this is no surprise, and in fact quite welcome... brown doesn't try to play games), there were a few places that had me surprised, and the symbology layered throughout the book was brilliantly done.	1
	the final word: if you go into this book expecting a 'great read', then you'll be disappointed.	1
	but if you go in expecting something to entertain you, something that is fun, a bit of mental candy, then you'll come out satisfied!      	1
	better than angels & demons, not as good as davinci code.let's start this way:  dan brown's books make great movies.	1
	why?	1
	because the films don't have time for his 'mystic-tristic-bulls--t,' -- they can get down to the heart of his thrillers.	1
	i've been dealing with esoterica, especially the religious kind for the last 40 years of my life, ever since i started my journey away from catholicism.	1
	brown's books are generally convolutlated paths as he picks and chooses between established history and fact and the pseudo-history and commonly held falacies which guide people away from reality, to a degree that sometimes confuses people who understand which is which.	1
	(warning:  if you read a book that promises to tell the truth about a mystery, count the exclamation points.	1
	if there is more than one in the first 20 pages, put it down and never come back unless you're reading it for a giggle.)	1
	the lost symbol falls into this category.	1
	brown has taken historic and 'occult' information and twisted them into a mishmash to support his plot, even if there is no real sense in the ideas.	1
	this is a boring attempt at something that he succeeded at in the davinci code (although the allegations in that book include things i truly wish were true).	1
	poor robert langdon must deal with the torture of a friend, all the while trying to stop something that he has little background to help himself, since he, himself, has no access to the hidden secrets that are contained in the masonic dogma.	1
	&while masons do, indeed, have secrets, as langdon contends in his lecture, they are neither occult (in the commonly held definition) nor people who are trained to lead the world:  for every washington or franklin, there are thousands of members who treat the order as a form of fraternity with secret handshakes and signs, dedicated to trying to make the world a better place.	1
	the best of them are more responsible for the creation of projects like the shriners' childrens' hospitals than in plotting world domination.	1
	this dedication to making the world better is why masons exist, and if some of the world's greatest leaders have been members of the group, it is because of this goal rather than a craving for some magical power to employ it attain their greatness.	1
	go rent the davinci code or angels & demons and you'll have a better time and won't waste the many hours it takes to read this thing.	1
	read it if there's nothing entertaining on tv or because you really have nothing else to do, but don't take it seriously.	1
	on second thought, wait until the movie comes out -- at least then you can enjoy a shorter, more coherent version.      	1
	more of the same.i was anticipating the release of the book having read his others.	1
	it follows a similar theme with symbolism, the masons, etc.	1
	there was enough action to keep it interesting, but after a while, i found myself just wanting it to be over sooner.	1
	overall disappointed, hoping for something a little fresher.      	1
	borrow, do not buy this book.well, all i can say is that i am thoroughly disappointed.	1
	i felt i was being fed answers to faqs about freemasons.	1
	though, by comparison to his other books, he did manage to write a slightly passable ending (or maybve  i was just so relieved that the ending had actually come).	1
	i think dan brown has worn out his formula and unfortunately his writing has not improved or matured.	1
	if anything, it seemed at its worst this time when i felt i was reading a screen play rather than a novel.	1
	the combination of these things have made this book fairly unreadable and dull.	1
	that having been said, where was the editor???	1
	no doubt put to sleep by the repetitive formula page after page after page.	1
	never have i skipped so many pages and not lost the plot of a novel.	1
	oh well, certainly a shame.      	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown.many authors that get their stories made into movies fall into the trap of writing their subsequent books for the big screen and not the reader.	1
	unfortunately, dan brown - the lost symbol, is one of those authors.      	1
	swing and a miss - spoiler warning.much like a zillion other people who will buy this book, i anticipated a fast-paced pager turner.	1
	i pre-ordered, looked forward to its release and read it almost straight through without pause.	1
	if nothing else, dan's books are easy to read.	1
	overall, i was disappointed.	1
	it is nowhere near as good as his last bestseller.	1
	reasons: 1. no controversy.	1
	come-on, dan, where's the 'real dirt' on the masons?	1
	i was expecting 'fireworks'.	1
	you didn't hesitate to take on the catholic church, yet the 'all-powerful' masons gave you pause?	1
	come on.	1
	2. nothing new.	1
	i'm pretty sure that i saw every tidbit of his research on one of several dozen history channel documentaries.	1
	3. a bit preachy.	1
	especially towards the end.	1
	come on, the big 'treasure', the much sought after 'word', is a bible?	1
	omg.	1
	4. evil son.	1
	come on.	1
	i have to imagine that every reader with a pulse saw this coming at about chapter 27.	1
	5. mason ceremonies.	1
	maybe i'm just jaded, but i think dan was more impressed, and even frightened, by the 'secret' ceremonies that i am.	1
	the details provided were redundant, and not scary at all.	1
	silly maybe.	1
	6. cia involvement.	1
	national security is at stake because our 'enemies' will see select government and political elite talking so scarily about killing, death and the like during masonic rites.	1
	are you kidding me?	1
	i couldn't help but think about the 'lodge' segments in flintstone cartoons i watched as a kid.	1
	sinister?	1
	professional d & d by successful geeks, dorks and members of the lucky sperm club, maybe.	1
	7. tom hanks.	1
	i simply cannot get him out of my mind.	1
	as i'm reading, in my mind, i see tom acting out the lines.	1
	painful indeed.      	1
	disappointing read.i loved angels & demons and davinci code and was really exicted to read the lost symbol, particularly as a dc resident and granddaughter of a mason.	1
	this was a disappointing experience for me and stretched credulity over the top.	1
	the japanese cia lady, the one-handed friend/father of a lunatic madman, brother of a secret lab scientist weighing the soul, the 'drowning death' of langdon, the trip to the top of the monument then the rotunda????	1
	what?????	1
	all to end at the bible???	1
	i didn't get it and it was just too weird.      	1
	i really really wantd to like this.......first off, i'm a big fan of dan brown and i loved the first two robert langdon books, i mean i loved them!	1
	i was really looking forward for the lost symbol to come out, i rushed out to get it, and now i'm sorry that i did.	1
	the plot is really deep, robert langdon has to solve clues inorder to save his friend.	1
	it has the usual things langdon is used to, solving clues, outrunning bad guys and saving the day.	1
	the many things that the lost symbol was missing was heart and charm that was in the first two books.	1
	as i was reading this, i honestly felt like i was walking through mud.	1
	this was about 100 pages to long.	1
	as readers, we don't need to know every single movment, every single thought and and every single action of every single character we meet.	1
	that's what dan brown does, and it really, really, slows the book down.	1
	there are pretty much three things that are going on at once, and when i was taken fron robert landon, and forced to read about the other characters, that had nothing to do with the main plot, i was very bored.	1
	i just didnt' care about the other characters.	1
	brown also spends to much time in the past of the secondary characters.	1
	we know about all of their pasts, and the thing is that it doesn't move the story forward, but drags it down.	1
	we read about two characters who are friends and one is wokring for antoher, and then we learn of their first meeting, and there was no reason.	1
	this happens more than a few times and just took away from the action.	1
	it's obvious that dan brown is a smart man, but the problem, he tells us so much that he knows, again, it brings the story down.	1
	i know how to drive a car, but i don't need to know how an engine works.	1
	that's that dan brown does in this book, shows us how the engine of a car work, and we don't need to know everything he tells us.	1
	i really hate saying all of this because i'm such a hige fan of the first two robert langdon adventures.	1
	if you want to read this, wait till it comes in paperback, or get it from the library or get it from a friend.	1
	its' really to bad at i feel this way about the book.	1
	i so wanted to like it.      	1
	couldn't put it down.having read four of dan brown's novels, i was very pleased to see how much the author has grown as a novelist in the lost symbol.	1
	in the davinci code, i had actually found much of the flippant humor to be somewhat offensive and childish.	1
	i think that the davinci code was more beloved because of its controversy than its writing style.in the lost symbol, there is very little use of slang, earthy humor, or sexual titilation.	1
	this novel is very focused and carefully paced to make the reader want to keep reading!	1
	the story all takes place in one day, which makes it even harder to put the book down for a day or more.	1
	the characters are all wonderful, and the climactic ending is surprising, shocking, and painful (emotionally and physically).	1
	some readers might find the book to be too transparent in its structure, as it is obvious that dan brown planned out every chapter to be a springboard to the next.	1
	perhaps the author could have used a greater variety of techniques to build tension.	1
	but, when i reached the end of the novel, i was very pleased with all that i had read.	1
	i also felt that i had learned a great deal about the masons and about the origins of many ideas, words, and myths.	1
	reading a dan brown novel is always eye-opening fun, and the lost symbol is a very good addition to this author's oeuvre.      	1
	great hero, nasty bad guy, lots of action.i really like a good villain in a story and this book has just about the nastiest bad guy you're going to come across since hannibal lector.	1
	the self-named mal'akh has transformed his body with weights and steroids and to make the transformation complete, he's covered himself with tattoos, everywhere save for a small circle on his head.	1
	during the day, when he goes out, he hides his tattooed face with makeup and wears a wig.	1
	mal'akh is after secret knowledge guarded by the masons and he'll stop at nothing to get it.	1
	to that end he's kidnapped peter solomon, the head of the masonic order in washington, dc.	1
	and he's lured symbologist robert langdon from harvard to washington, because he believes langdon is the only man alive who can decipher the ancient symbols that will lead to this knowledge.	1
	solomon is langdon's friend and if langdon doesn't do mal'akh's bidding, solomon is going to die.	1
	mal'akh has secrets of his own, like a long held grudge.	1
	he's also nuttier than a fruitcake, but he's very, very smart and extremely manipulative.	1
	he's not to be underestimated.	1
	he's ruthless and he knows all the right buttons to push to get langdon to do his bidding, even though at times langdon doesn't realize he's doing it.	1
	however, mal'akh isn't the only one after these secrets.	1
	the cia is too.	1
	and they also seem hellbent on keeping langdon from succeeding in his quest to find this forbidden knowledge, a knowledge langdon doesn't believe in, but he soldiers on, because his friend's life is at stake.	1
	little does he realize his own life is at stake as well in this story that kept me up all hours.	1
	this book has it all.	1
	a great hero, a super nasty bad guy and lots of action.      	1
	30 chapters to long..good first half thriller,(like it was written for a movie).	1
	the end is a rambling mess.	1
	almost like two different books.      	1
	the lost symbol?.this book should have been titled the lost plot, the lost creative writing style or where's my character?	1
	while i have enjoyed brown's other works this is a cut and paste of his other two best sellers with little new to offer.	1
	his use of the free masons and the secret society is not only getting old but plain wrong.	1
	the mason's are a wonderful and peaceful society of people dedicated to do good for mankind.	1
	brown takes great pains to slander the order for the purpose of making money.	1
	the book is slow and tediously detail oriented to the point of boredom, i fell asleep several times trying to read through this brick sized book.	1
	i found myself scanning over his boring detailed paragraph after paragraph writing to get to the point.	1
	in the end the point was a total disappointment.	1
	but his name is big enough now that i am sure we will see the movie posters and tom hanks ready to reprise his role by the beginning of the year.	1
	i thought after close to six years of writing we were going to get a gem, instead the reader gets a lump of coal. 	1
	brown largely delivers the goods here.as a longtime thriller reader, i've always had a healthy amount of respect for dan brown's talents.	1
	the two brown novels that feature harvard symbiolgist robert langdon -- angels & demons and the da vinci code -- are two of the most entertaining thrillers i've ever read.	1
	admittedly, neither book features first-rate prose or three-dimensional characterization; but they are both brilliantly constructed page-turners packed with fascinating tidbits about history, religion, and science.	1
	they are almost impossible to put down once you start them.	1
	while the lost symbol isn't quite as good as those two earlier novels, it's still a kick to read.	1
	brown follows his usual plot formula here (langdon teams up with a female sidekick, solves puzzles, is chased around by the authorities and a two-dimensional villain), with only a handful of major variations.	1
	but the formula is a reliable one, and this novel has the same delirious momentum that a&d; and dvc had.	1
	so if you enjoyed the prior langdon novels, you will most likely enjoy the lost symbol, although probably not as much, since brown treads on so much familiar territory the third time around.	1
	also, the lost symbol is a bit heavy on new age philosphizing.	1
	brown is clearly a humanist, but he tries hard here to express his humanist beliefs in a manner that won't offend organized religion.	1
	the result is a series of preachy, oblique, and drawn out dialogues that slow the momentum of the story, especially toward the end.	1
	i found the ending a slight disappointment, although i do give brown credit for trying something a little different.	1
	overall, however, the lost symbol is a solid sequel that delivers the goods.	1
	it's a very well exected page-turner, one of the most entertaining novels i've read so far this year.	1
	it is also way better than all the da vinci code knockoffs i've been reading over the past five years.	1
	so if you're a dan brown fan, you should definitely pick this one up.	1
	and if you're a dan brown hater -- well, this novel won't change your opinion of the man and his talents.	1
	the secret is... how to die.dan brown, in  takes us on another thrilling ride through the 'ancient mysteries.'	1
	robert langdon, the harvard symbologist, carries us along through numerous brink-of-death situations, giving the book edge-of-your-seat momentum.	1
	numerous reviews have discussed the plot, so i will move directly to my comments.	1
	first, i enjoyed the amusement park ride.	1
	since i am often reading non-fiction titles, when i pick up fiction i want to be entertained, drawn into the story, intrigued.	1
	i read it in one sitting.	1
	the puzzles (ok, i confess i am a sudoku fan, the magic square) the misdirection, the chases, i enjoyed the ride.	1
	i also enjoyed these quotes sprinkled throughout the book.	1
	my favorites:  'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'	1
	arthur c. clarke, futurist,  (the lost symbol, pg 86) instantly brought to mind my first experiences with a fax machine!	1
	the paper gets there how???	1
	'wide acceptance of an idea does not prove its validity.'	1
	the lost symbol, pg 79  i love this one.	1
	it seems everyday our news reports include  lady-in-the-laundromat  or   the man-in-the-deli  opinions validating a popular (but uninformed, unsubstantiated) opinion.	1
	of course, here brown uses it to fuel his challenge-all-religion stance... belittling myths of his choosing.	1
	setting that aside, i still love the quote.	1
	'if thoughts affect the world, then we must be very careful how we think.	1
	destructive thoughts have influence, too, and we all know it's far easier to destroy than to create.'	1
	lost symbol, pg 501.  can we make this every school's motto?	1
	i'm a positive thinker, i'm a half-full glass person, and have witnessed the power of prayer, so this resonates with me.	1
	in fact, when brown's story descends to the depths, i cringed and almost stopped reading.	1
	thirdly, i thoroughly enjoyed the setting of washington dc.	1
	on a recent visit to alexandria, va driving to the old town on carlisle drive, we stumbled upon stunning monument/museum called the george washington masonic national memorial.	1
	i had completely forgotten that washington was a freemason, and was amazed how 'unhidden' it was, for this society with secrets.	1
	brown mentions it in the book, along with numerous buildings and their histories.	1
	as an avid reader, and a book professional, i thoroughly enjoyed the character's 'ride' on the circulation belt... something i would have loved to do!	1
	the washington setting will undoubtedly boost the attraction of these majestic buildings.	1
	on the negative side, i was distracted by the believability of his facts.	1
	as a widely read person, i was often thinking that doesn't sound true, i should research that.	1
	when i pick up fiction, i don't expect to get homework assignments!	1
	if you can remind yourself to stick to the story, and not remember the inaccuracies as fact, the read could still work.	1
	when you recommend a book to a friend, the fear is they could trustingly embrace it as historically accurate, hence the caution.	1
	for example, the akedah is a historically substantiated story of abraham, in obedience to god's command, willing to sacrifice his own son, isaac.	1
	god intervenes with a substitute sacrifice, showing his love for abraham.	1
	in the lost symbol, pg 445, brown invents an actual knife; the 'akedah knife', gives it mystical properties and a 'destiny' to fulfill.	1
	all the while alluding that his story, peter solomon/zachary and abraham/isaac is one and the same.	1
	brown's creating the son's desire to self-sacrifice and involve his father, twists this historical story into a meaningless one.	1
	one wonders why brown's fiction needs to dig at the tenets of the various religious worldviews.	1
	is it to create the controversy that sells lots of books?	1
	you decide.	1
	throughout the story we observe the premise 'how to die', over and over.	1
	i, on the other hand would have celebrated the characters that portray, how to live.	1
	the love of a friend, sister, brother, fellow believer, to go to whatever lengths necessary to help.	1
	despite the inaccuracies, i would recommend this title to fiction readers who love to discuss the latest bestseller `round cocktails or the water cooler, readers who can separate fact from fiction, and to readers, who can suspend their disbelief and just enjoy the ride. 	1
	extremely disappointing (spoiler alert).last paragraph contains a spolier ....  i bought this in high anticipation and was extremely disappointed .. short review is that the writing of dan brown is repetitive and rambling, i found myself forwarding thru pages at a time bored by the book.	1
	it seems like the book was a report that required a certain number of words or pages and dan wrote to fill the order.	1
	the entire plot could have been summarized in about one hundred page short story.	1
	dan tries to fill the book with linguistic trickery and cheap tricks.	1
	the plot is not plausible in the least, i was three steps ahead of the author in figuring out the plot.	1
	every character speaks in riddles and holds a part of the key to solving the mysteries of the lost symbol, it gets very tiring getting lead on by each and every character when in the normal universe people are much more straight forward.	1
	even when they characters are being hunted down they speak to each other in riddles, they have no time in the plot for long winded conversations but ..... most importantly, i found it incredible that the son of peter solomon was murdered and his wealth stolen and no investigation was ever performed to find out who stole his money.	1
	i mean, get real ... peter solomon is one of the wealthiest men in the world and he couldn't find out who stole his sons money and identification after he was murdered?	1
	get real!	1
	this one aspect absolutely ruined the book for me.	1
	dan brown, you can do better ... keep writing like this and you will be a one hit wonder. 	1
	disappointing.i enjoyed reading dan brown's davinci code, but thought angels and demons was mediocre at best.	1
	this book can be compared with angels and demon - disappointing.	1
	the subplot was ridiculous and the book dragged on and on - i ended up skimming quite a bit and only read to the end because i felt obligated to read what i bought.	1
	i would not recommend this book.	1
	don't waste time or money on this one.       	1
	predictable, stupid and infuriating - no spoilers.i had this one figured out about one third into the book.	1
	the bad guy way too cartoonish.	1
	at first, the academic stuff is interesting, but then becomes literally a space filler, serving no other purpose than to make the book longer.	1
	a cacophony of conspiracy theories, leading to a 'great' mystery, that is, of course, a major letdown.	1
	traps, hidden meanings and obfuscation that take a serious leap of faith that authorities ignore normal protocols in order to fit lame plot twists.	1
	i really like the da vinci code, and i did like angels and demons, up until the part where langdon jumps from the helicopter.	1
	this is a stupid book, that may hold some suspense for very gullible people.	1
	i am severely disappointed, and am sorry i wasted the purchase price.	1
	avoid this at all peril.	1
	if you are unfortunate, and did purchase this, as soon as you figure out the major plot twist (should be in the first third of the book), go look up the plot summary on wiki, and realize that you are smarter than dan brown.	1
	this book insulted my intelligence.      	1
	can i have my money back?.had such hopes for this book.	1
	found it totally predicatable and in the end it felt like a huge sell out.	1
	like db sold out to all of the critics who reviled his books as a work of the devil and now he was trying to soothe their worries and tap into another market segment.	1
	additionally, there were multiple typos and incorrect word usages throughout the book.	1
	my 17 year old could have edited this book and done a better job.	1
	can honestly say, i won't be waiting anxiously for the movie or the next db book.	1
	anyone want a slightly used kindle version of this book?      	1
	absolute waste of time.i know the book from its audible version.	1
	reading/listening to it is an absolute waste of time.	1
	the plot is an insult to common sense.	1
	after da vinci's code, it seems so predictable.	1
	it adds nothing new.	1
	highly unrecommended!      	1
	the lost work of dan brown.with a long six year anticipation after da vinci code, i was excited to receive this book on release date.	1
	however, the more i read, i couldn't erase my feeling that this book will be the worst dan brown book i've read.	1
	now that i have finished the book, i can say with certainty that this book is indeed the worst one from dan brown.	1
	here are few reasons why i think it's worst: 1. similar story line as angels & demons / the da vinci codea story of lunatic who wants to reveal old, ancient and mystic secret.again.	1
	seriously?	1
	2. usage of unrealistic high-tech stuffcome on.	1
	'breathable water'somebody drowned.	1
	turns out he didnt because he was still breathing due to 'oxygenated liquid.'	1
	are you kidding me?	1
	3. story line being too obviousi knew the story line will end at the place it ends before langdon and his crew went there.	1
	the description was too obvious but langdon took forever on chit chatting.	1
	a tall stone in washington dc.	1
	doesn't that ring a bell already?i've never been to dc and still i figured out the place where the book ends.	1
	how can you mess up so bad, dan brown?	1
	p.s: did all that iphone, wikipedia, twitter, etc talking necessary? 	1
	enough, already!	1
	!.i rarely write reviews of books i dislike, but i don't want people to waste their money on the hardback edition of this.	1
	i liked the davinci code and angels and demons, and even deception point and digital fortress.	1
	this book, however, jumped the shark.	1
	i figured out the major plot twist a third of the way into the book, and fell asleep 3 times during the last chapters of the book, when all the big reveals happen.	1
	it was that boring.	1
	brown took his formula one book too far.	1
	if i said anything else, it would involve spoilers, and i hate to do that.	1
	this is a ho hum book if i ever read one.       	1
	i was yelling at the book on cd recording!	1
	!.i believe that all books should be 'read' first on tape before they are published so the editors can pick up on illogical or just stupid writing!	1
	the book on cd is very short, 5 cd's.	1
	amazing how langdon flies to washington, prepares for a big speach, yet isn't greeted by anyone before he enters into the lecture hall?	1
	and, these supposed high tech, secure labs, being accessed with a swipe card and pin?	1
	no biometric or retinal scan?	1
	come on.	1
	who could have a conversation with robert langdon, he's always spouting some long diatribe.	1
	the best part was the character of peter simon.	1
	he was kidnapped, mutilated, put in sensory deprivation, yet he requires no doctor and can take the time to explain to peter the meaning of it all?	1
	there is one part where the book reads ' peter put his hand on langdon's shoulder', what, did he put the bloody stump on his shoulder?	1
	when peters sister flies out to the house where the security company supposedly finds him in 'bad shape', why don't they notice there is no ambulance outside?	1
	i could go on.	1
	i ended up yelling at the end of angels and demon's too.	1
	unbelievable stuff when you 'hear' it.      	1
	not one of brown's best efforts.i've read all of dan brown's novels, and i have to say, i'm disappointed in the lost symbol.	1
	it's as though he's been drinking too much of his own kool-aid.	1
	there are way too many references to his other books, and it seems as though brown just didn't try too hard with this book.	1
	it reads more like a movie script, and not a very good one at that.	1
	did he run out of ideas and then go see 'national treasure 2: book of secrets' to get more?	1
	and is it just me, or does anyone else see the bellamy character being written to lure morgan freeman into the film version?	1
	the characters are flimsy, and why oh why does he keep saying 'robert langdon' (using his full name) just about every time he refers to that character?	1
	and we haven't even gotten to the formulaic issue - do all of his langdon books have to have a lone, weird guy as the antagonist?	1
	i found myself slogging through this book instead of flying through it, what with the repeated explanations of the same things (as if he's writing a high school essay and has to pad it to make it long enough) and the sometimes awkward attempts at romance between langdon and katherine.	1
	overall, this is one of those books that makes you wish you could get your money back.	1
	sad.      	1
	good grief, this was bad.i don't know what else to add to all the other negative reviews this book got.	1
	this was simply torture to get through.	1
	all the action takes place in a day and yet the book just drug like it had an anchor to the plot.      	1
	the lost symbol got lost along the way?.dan has now decided that if he just plugs a few facts into his now perfected boiler plate plot scheme he has a new best seller....and of course he is right!	1
	trouble is he forgot that this book was supposed to hold some new perspectives or gravitas about i)solomon's key and/or ii) a lost symbol?if freemasonry began in 1717 what does this have to do with egyptian pyramids or solomon's temple?	1
	on the latter the book clearly does not deliver--unlike the da vinci code in spades?	1
	dan ends up being an apologist for every slight or criticism, true or false, hurled against the freemasons--the worlds largest secret society.	1
	he really stumbles at the conclusion picking the sun symbol for the lost symbol--the only thing that is lost is the reason dan wrote this book?	1
	[no controversy = no content] so what took 6 years?	1
	there is no shortage of fascinating personalities and history of masons like gen albert pike, fdr, and brother george washington--so why include childish puzzles about the dollar bill and whatever the 8x8 zodiac square was supposed to represent?	1
	duh?	1
	you can find those on the www/hello tom hanks!      	1
	not up to its hype.definitely not deserving of the ny times top 10. the story starts off slow, picks up a little bit and then goes down hill.	1
	brown was stretching, especially at the end of the book, to get as many masonic 'symbols' into the book as he possibly could.	1
	it was a 'mystery' book that you could stop reading at any point and not wonder how it ended.      	1
	don't waste your time (wait for the movie instead).this book was a waste of time (trust me, i just finished it).	1
	wait for the money, it will save you days of precious time that you can actually spend doing something productive.        	1
	the lost symbol.a very boring read, in fact the only reason i read the entire book was i kept hoping it would get better.	1
	i wasted several hours - it never did!	1
	there is nothing about this book that is appealing.	1
	it's preachy, unimaginable, over the top in stretching possible scenarios and mr. brown was missed the mark trying to make his good characters appealing and his bad characters loathful - he didn't succeed.	1
	he makes langdon an idiot in this and the government agencies involved conspirators with something to cover up that could end the world as we know it.	1
	he should have stopped with the davinci code when it comes to writing about symbols and picked a different topic to write about.	1
	don't waste your money, (get it from the library or a used book store if you must read it because there will be many there), or your time unless you need a nap, it will put you to sleep.       	1
	dan phoned this is.this insipid book was painful to finish.	1
	the research assistants were charged with finding as much masonic history as possible, along with a summary or overview of ancient religious symbols to which dan pasted an incredulous screenplay of a plot.	1
	refund owed!      	1
	a big disappointment!.i read all four of dan brown's previous novels.	1
	i liked them, enjoyed them, and i thought they were stories that really made you think and open your mind to new ideas.	1
	the lost symbol is a big disappointment.	1
	the ending is an insult to the reader's intelligence.	1
	after all the build up, the ending was a let down.	1
	i will not spoil it for those who already bought it and may already be reading it.	1
	they may like the story.	1
	but, i am certain that most of the readers, especially those who read brown's previous books, will be disappointed.	1
	if i knew what i know now about this book, i will not buy it, and i definitely will not spend, or a better word is waste, my time on this book.      	1
	predictable.some of the masonic history stuff was good, but the ending was way too predictable and felt rushed.	1
	if i could get a refund i would, but i kept it more than seven days.	1
	do not waste your money on this.      	1
	almost 600 pages...and a waste of your life..i don't think many expect a literary classic when cracking open a dan brown novel.	1
	what i think is fair to expect is a thrilling story with a fantastic ending.	1
	i've read all of dan brown's books with deception point being my favorite, actually...and the lost symbol is the worst of them all.	1
	there are so many places i could start...the predictable characters, the plot twists you see coming, the irrationality of his characters...but the ending was just, just terrible.	1
	i continued to read because i continued to hold out hope that brown was going to finally unleash his big surprise, the reason that he took me through almost 600 pages of mediocre plot to get to that big 'oh my god' moment like in his previous novels.	1
	it never came.	1
	i can't understand what brown was doing in the years between the dvc and now.	1
	through his meticulous research did he forget that the story was supposed to have a point?	1
	also, why in the world is robert langdon suddenly and so frustratingly stupid?	1
	i would think, that after his heavily referenced 'adventures' in dvc and a&d; that he would be more open to things like the ancient mysteries.	1
	i can't fully convey my disappointment with this book.	1
	it was utterly a waste of my life.	1
	the plot started mediocre at best, but then crashed and burned at the end.	1
	save yourself the time and leave this one on the shelf.      	1
	disappointing.i enjoyed the da vinci code and had been looking forward to dan brown's new book.	1
	what a let-down.	1
	it is wordy, repetitious and derivative, but mostly and unforgivably, it is boring.	1
	i knew who the villain really was almost immediately, and there was way too much about the masons.	1
	the spells and demons went on and on.	1
	toward the end, i was just skimming through the pages to see how it finally ended.      	1
	very disappointing!.thoroughly enjoyed all four of brown's previous books.	1
	this one put me to sleep.	1
	pointless.	1
	i fear he's run out of steam.      	1
	interesting facts wrapped around a poor story.living in washington, dc, i eagerly anticipated the lost symbol hoping to catch some insight into the local history.	1
	what i was left with was a large case of buyer's remorse.	1
	i am familar with dan brown, having read all of his previous books beginning with the da vinci code and working my way back.	1
	the first thing that struck me was for such a famous author, i found dan brown's writing style boring.	1
	his character interaction has the sophistication of dripping water.	1
	what saves brown are the truly interesting historical facts he draws out.	1
	the lost symbol begins with professor robert langdon tricked into coming to washington to give a speech in the capitol.	1
	what quickly transpires is a set of unbelievable circumstances i constantly found myself asking the pages, 'are you serious?'	1
	now i must add that brown did toss in enough twists so that every time i thought i had figured everything out, i was pleasantly surprised to find out i was wrong.	1
	on that thought though, i feel that brown lied to the reader about the major character plot twist.	1
	early on, i had made the correct guess about that character but i discounted it because of the way brown presented certain passages.	1
	it's nice to toss twists at the reader, but please don't lie to the reader to get there.	1
	[on a side note, i do not know if it was intentional or not but the king street metro stop doesn't come close to resembling what brown described.]	1
	by the time the national security secret was revealed, i put the book down and almost walked away.	1
	i really could not believe that this story was revolving around that far flung problem.	1
	by the end of the book i was glad that i had read it but i felt cheated.	1
	interesting masonic and washington tidbits, poor plot and writing style.	1
	if you can overlook the negative which i mentioned then you will probably enjoy the book, if you can't then you will probably feel cheated.	1
	weighed, measured, and found wanting....*simply a review of why i liked it, not another rehashing of the story* i truly enjoyed this book.	1
	i'm a fan of dan brown because he knows how to tell a story.	1
	i could care less about the controversy he imbues, what religious group he's pissed off, or what he may or may not believe.	1
	do his stories deserve my attention?	1
	can his stories keep my attention?	1
	will i remember his stories after i'm done reading his stories?	1
	my answer to all three is 'yes'.	1
	yeah, i admit... i got caught up in the hype of dan brown mania, but i've read his other books so it was a pretty safe bet that this one would be good.	1
	it was.	1
	if there was one word that i would use to describe how i felt as i was reading this book; it would be 'fun'.	1
	i felt fun, i felt like a verb.	1
	crazy?	1
	probably, but a good book will do that to you.	1
	it kept me up at night, i took longer breaks at work than i should have, i coordinated my reading with eating non-messy foods so i wouldn't have to stop, heck i even stopped reading my collection of short stories by allison tyler.	1
	i enjoy reading books that are fun because i read to be entertained.	1
	'the lost symbol' is pure entertainment.	1
	dan brown writes in a way that you, literally, have to force yourself to stop and go have a life because if you wait and say, 'oh, i'll stop after this chapter', you will never get up.	1
	it's a roller coaster of words, this book, and i certaintly enjoyed the ride.	1
	i loved reading about the masons, which presidents were masons, who in history was a mason, the astrological elements of washington d.c., secrets hidden in plain sight, noetic science (really.	1
	this exists...	1
	really?).	1
	i shook with hatred for sato, and mal'akh... is there another character in literature (recent) who exudes so much evil?	1
	the worst kind of evil tu boot.	1
	the worst meaning; he has the means, opportunity, and the black desire to pull off his plan.	1
	and nothing is going to stop him.	1
	he's a murderous, fundamentalist terminator.	1
	he will not be stopped, he will not be deterred, and everything... everything has a plan.	1
	it grates me to read about characters this evil but dan has that ability to make them just a (super tiny) tad bit likeable.	1
	so why didn't i give this book five stars?	1
	the ending.	1
	it had nothing to do with me agreeing with it, offended by it, or anything dumb like that.	1
	it was just... not good.	1
	i mean 500 pages of an enthralling story only to get to the end, find out the secret, and then... fizzle.	1
	every single one of brown's books have led me, right up to the last page, with a mach 8 ending.	1
	except for this one.	1
	i think that is one reason it's getting such bad press.	1
	it's like having a good meal of steak, lobster, and shrimp, only to get a tootsie roll for desert.	1
	the question is, would i read this book if i knew what i know now about the ending?	1
	yes i would.	1
	i'm not going to miss out on a slammin' steak and lobster dinner just because the desert isn't good.	1
	next time i'll just skip the desert.	1
	:-)        	1
	brown mailed this one in..in anticipation for the release of the lost symbol, i went through and re-read brown's other books.	1
	dan brown generally puts out a pretty good page turner.	1
	the lost symbol doesn't even come close to measuring up to his other works.	1
	i would have probably been better off renting national treasure, than spending the time on this davinci code retread.      	1
	alas, babylon.i was not a big enthusiast of the code, but at least it was true to its mission.	1
	i was deeply disappointed in the symbol.	1
	it was a combination of national treasure and the celestine prophecies.	1
	it is a really poor knock-off of existing pop culture.	1
	the ending was a real cop-out and i'm afraid that the entire novel is just a huge 'cash cow'.	1
	one would think that after seven years, the author could produce something with some integrity and believability.       	1
	page turner, but not much more.while the book is a page-turner, i found the plot hard to swallow.	1
	furthermore, i noticed just how awkward of a writer dan brown seems to be.	1
	he uses many phrases that one would almost expect to find in pulp fiction.	1
	characters are flat, and where they are developed, i was distracted by the writing style.	1
	the new age elements of the book really turned me off, early on, but i pressed on because the book was a page turner.	1
	unfortunately, with one exception (an unexpected plot twist toward the end), they payoff was disappointing.      	1
	just read da vinci code over again instead.i kept waiting for the plot to twist but the entire storyline is telegraphed from the beginning.	1
	the hope that the ending would somehow be enlightening or entertaining and make up for hundreds of pages that do nothing to advance the storyline was also in vain.        	1
	you, the amazon reader could do better.the overall feeling is that dan brown wrote this book by formula and random sentence generators.	1
	want to recreate the effect?	1
	try this:  1)  select an old city (>200 years old)  2)  obtain random facts about monuments in (old city) and the artwork therein;  3)  select a secret society at random;  4)  google '(old city) conspiracy' and take the most popular and the list popular hits.	1
	ready?	1
	here's your dust jacket summary: langdon meets a member of (secret society) who calls him to (old city) where he must solve the ancient mystery of (conspiracy theory #1) by driving from monument to monument based on his knowledge of (obscure fact) finding (art object) at each monument.	1
	ultimately, langdon will discover that (secret society) is really protecting the secret of (conspiracy theory #2) by making it so that only its members can really understand the hidden meaning in the art.	1
	congratulations!	1
	call tom hanks, and for god's sake, don't spend $18 on this horrific and tortured piece of writing.      	1
	philosophy 101.the book was ok, but the last several chapters killed it.	1
	on and on about the same thing, over and over, boring and boring.	1
	if i had wanted to study philosophy, etc, etc, etc, i would read a different book.	1
	too much!	1
	too much!	1
	too much!!!!	1
	give me a break!	1
	in the neck!      	1
	familiar formula.yes, it's a familiar formula for anyone who has read dan brown's prior work: solve a mystery under a time crunch; wrap up the story in about 24 hours of 'real time'; leave the reader hanging at the end of most chapters; fill in the background with flashbacks or monologues; and have the clues be in symbols.	1
	don't forget the faith/science theme.	1
	still, the book works.	1
	not as literature but as entertainment.	1
	on most levels 'the lost symbol' is a standard crime/mystery novel plus masonic symbols.	1
	brown skills as a storyteller, coupled with the now-familiar task of figuring out the symbols, are enough to keep the reader interested.	1
	i'm sure some loyal readers will love it and others will absolutely hate it.	1
	i can hear them now: 'national treasure has already done dc,' 'same book/different city/country/continent,' and maybe even 'dan brown hates football.'	1
	(not a spoiler, just a comment as to how far i expect someone to go to be offended by this book.)	1
	color me lukewarm.	1
	it's not especially good or bad.       	1
	disappointed.i waited over five years for this book, and could hardly wait to tear the amazon package open and start reading.	1
	i'm sorry, dan brown, but you disappointed me.	1
	it was repetitive, boring, and i have the feeling this may have been brown's 2nd or 3rd rewrite of the book, and that's why i had to wait all these years.	1
	not only did national treasure beat him to the punch, they ko'd him.	1
	what i would really like to see from brown is an art history book.	1
	i found the albrecht durer engraving the most interesting part of the book.      	1
	worth the wait.	1
	*spoilers alert* after months and months of surmise on what will our robert langdon will decode this time, we are finally here.	1
	so for the people who weigh that it will be about the temple, atlantis, bermuda triangle or something about a religious sect, -wrong.	1
	this time brown decided - freemasons.	1
	i've watched too many discovery and history channel for this one yet reading about them and the 'supposedly' initiation and practices did not surprise me but reading it on dan brown's novel is diverse.	1
	the usual tenor are still there.	1
	langdon gets summoned to go somewhere that, well hello - he has to solve a mystery and since he is professor or symbology and all that he got into the middle of it.	1
	the profligate is someone who have grotesque looks.	1
	this time his name is mal'akh, dude was covered in tattoos from acientt symbols/signs, pillars to a double headed phoenix on his chest, etc.	1
	he is probably the most bizarre and insane villain out of all langdon books.	1
	and let's not forget soemthing gruesome to start off.	1
	this time its a hand.	1
	severed hand skewered on a wood to be exact with tattoos of the ancient mysteries with the index finger pointing upward.	1
	(i hope you are not eating while reading this) lastly,  historical facts and fictions were amalgamated, and of course something that people can look up at the world wide web.	1
	i for one is a victim of this, took me awhile to finish the book because i have to find out what and where is 1733 16th st. nw and 4210 silver hill rd.	1
	grinning like an idiot,.	1
	i found out that the 1st one is the scottish masons - supreme council 33 degree and the 2nd one is the smithsonian national museum of natural history.	1
	i also admit to calling the phone number 202-329-5746 out of curiosity.	1
	brown must have put that there for some reason right?	1
	and i interpret it as 'you must find out what this is'.	1
	you may also find yourself researching about noetic science, os, the invisible college, smsc and more.	1
	i admit, i got lost on some parts, so i have to pause and digest what i just read.	1
	the theme / plot ruminate around this ancient mysteries and katherine's research and goal in life - the use of advance science to rediscover what the lost knowledge the ancient world had unveiled about our universe.	1
	i wouldn't even bash about the flaws, i'd let the professional book critic do that.	1
	as a fan of brown's - i'd say this book is brilliant, suspenseful, informative, highly intriguing, it kind of gave me a new perspective on the eventful prediction that is supposed to happen on 2012 and it made me want to go back to d.c and examine the capitol a little to closely.	1
	in short it an enjoyable diversion from the real world.	1
	highly recommended.	1
	more of the same.save your money, this is just a rework of the code.	1
	same stuff just a different settling.	1
	and page after page of made up, new age gobly goop.      	1
	as you know, bob....i am just starting chapter 32 (out of 133).	1
	so i'm about one quarter of the way through.	1
	thus farthe lost symbol is a little difficult to swallow.	1
	all of brown's books suffer from information dumps, but in this one he doesn't even try to disguise them.	1
	characters other than langdon are literally just one dimensional things for him to talk at.	1
	langdon will lecture for five paragraphs and then some other character will say 'interesting, go on...' it makes me wonder if brown has given up.	1
	for some reason in his other works i have been drawn in.	1
	the information dumps were tolerable, maybe necessary to get the reader up to speed in a timely manner so they can come along for the ride that is the rest of the novel.	1
	spoliers ahead.	1
	another issue are the so called cliffhanger chapter endings and view point shifts mid-thought.	1
	katherine recounts her first time crossing the space between one door and another door in total darkness.	1
	she thinks about how simple their navigation system is.	1
	we have to wait several chapters to find out they put down a strip of carpet to guide you.	1
	so often brown has the character think about something but refuses to tell us exactly what it is.	1
	if it's not going to spoil the plot just tell us!	1
	it is rather anticlimactic to wait five chapters to discover the ingenious navigation system is a strip of carpet!	1
	then there are the internal inconsistencies.	1
	maybe someone who knows more about physics and science can answer this for me.	1
	the entire purpose of having the lab in a dark enclosed area separate from the rest of the world is to prevent outside energy from throwing their measurements off.	1
	okay, i can buy that.	1
	they can't have lights in the massive chamber surrounding the actual lab because the energy used to power the lights, or the photons emitted by the lights would muck up their readings.	1
	fine.	1
	then why can they have a hydrogen fuel cell, computers, and lights inside the lab?	1
	is it because they know exactly what, and ho much is put off by the fuel cell and the electonics?	1
	if that is the case why they have a light outside the lab, determine what it emits, and calibrate for it?	1
	it seems like brown just wanted an excuse to show the charactersstruggling with a fear of the dark and to artificially create tnsion.	1
	and the tension is lame!	1
	oh my god, it's dark, it's really creepy and suspensful.	1
	no it's not.	1
	not in the least.         	1
	poor writing meets weak plot.dan brown's writing has not only not improved it has gotten worse.	1
	the plot is weak, the writing is poor, and the book is an overall disappointment.	1
	i will not read any of dan brown's work in the future.        	1
	the symbolist has no clothes.this book is simply dreadful!i bought this book the day of publication (not something i usually do) because i was facing a long train ride the next day and thought it would be just the thing.	1
	instead, i found myself struggling to finish it 10 days later.	1
	poorly written, no editing, cardboard characters, etc.	1
	the worst thing is that it's the same as the other two books:  the mutilated body of a wise old man is used to drag professor langdon into the mystery, and then he and a female companion run all over town trying to solve the puzzle before time runs out and something terrible happens.	1
	this time the town is washington dc, but same thing.	1
	browns idea of suspense is 'i've solved the mystery!...no, wait, i didn't solve it.	1
	now i've solved it!	1
	no, wait..' over and over again.	1
	in the end, langdon doesn't actually solve the puzzle, one of the characters gives him the answer as a reward for good behavior!there are basic medical/scientific factual errors (an adult won't grow taller from taking steroids and growth hormones) and errors in english usage ('to hew' means to cut or carve--i doubt if an old testament knife could have been 'hewn' from an iron meteorite, as is stated repeatedly) that better editing might have corrected, but i doubt if an editor could have trimmed the book of all the tiresome pseudo-philosophic meanderings.i'm sure the book will be an great success and make millions of $$.	1
	at least they don't have to make a movie out of this one--it's already been done, twice.	1
	(national treasure, i and ii)      	1
	reads like a wordy screenplay.does the world really need my two cents about this book?	1
	no.	1
	will anyone read this?	1
	probably not - but i made a deal with myself that i would write a review of all the books i read.	1
	once again, robert langdon must race against time and a villian as improbable as an ayn rand character to save - something.	1
	(i was never very clear on this point) when it is not excessively preachy and wordy, this tome reads like a screenplay.	1
	i found it utterly forgettable and to be completely frank - boring.	1
	there, i said it.	1
	if this were not a book club selection, i would have never been able to finish.	1
	i am perpetually mystified by the books that become the latest popular craze - but i am happy that people are reading.       	1
	ending was huge disappointment.	1
	what a rip off..i was having a great time with this book until the bad guy died, and then nothing happened for many, many chapters.	1
	there was no answer to the burning questions raised throughout the book and there were no secrets to reveal.	1
	it was the biggest let down i have ever experienced in a book.	1
	the last several chapters were seriously painful to read, but i kept plugging through waiting for the big reveal that the entire book led up to.	1
	and there just wasn't one.	1
	nothing.	1
	i felt robbed of my time and energy to find nothing at the end.	1
	it made no sense that all the generations of life and death protection and secrecy was to protect nothing.      	1
	who cares?.the letdown i experienced at the end of the da vinci code was bad enough; the anticlimax in the lost symbol was an embarrassment.	1
	after hearing breathless warnings through most of the book of the potential destruction of civilization as we know it, of how the guardians must sacrifice their lives rather than let the symbol fall into the wrong hands, we finally learn that the answer is trivial - even silly.	1
	brown needs to learn that before you write the book you need to be certain that the story line tracks in a convincing and satisfying way, or you risk angering the reader for having been suckered into wasting their time with the book at all.	1
	i won't make this mistake with brown again.        	1
	a very, very, very boring book!.on the one hand, you are tempted to think that this 'novel' is really a thinly-veiled screenplay: in reading it, one can imagine the stars who are intended to be cast: hanks, of course, probably morgan freeman as the capitol architect, etc.	1
	on the other hand, this book is so numbingly boring that it is difficult to see how any director---even one much more talented than opie---could turn this vehicle into something that anyone could possibly sit through for two hours.      	1
	page turner with too many pages.this will be short and to the point.	1
	i was enthralled with brown's fast-paced thriller until the last twenty pages or so.	1
	at which point i not only couldn't wait to put the book down, but had to force myself to finish it.	1
	what a way to ruin a good story (yes, i realize this is not a piece of well-written, great literature or deep, mind-boggling earth-shattering philosophy -- it is exactly what it is) by not knowing when or how to let go of it after the climax.	1
	what was, for close to 480 pages, a proverbially exciting page-turner turned in the last few chapters into a maddeningly boring, preachy, interminable new-age sermon that made me sorry i read the damn thing in the first place.	1
	i can only guess that all of the reviewers that i read who didn't comment on this point decided to quit reading while they were ahead and never got to experience this exasperating let down.	1
	brown, you owe your readers a huge apology.	1
	or else you should be forced to climb up the washington monument, one step at a time -- on your knees.      	1
	great langdon continuation.great book!	1
	i enjoyed this book just as much as angels & demons and the da vinci code.	1
	the lost symbol sucks in the reader and keeps them captivated until the book is finished.	1
	brown weaves a fantastic tale of secrets and symbols revolving around the free masons and washington d.c. without summarizing the book, as i'm sure others have done, i will say that if you enjoyed brown's other books and/or enjoy a good thriller read that is fast paced, this is a good book to read.      	1
	a pedantic, dull book.i read quite few thrillers and detective novels, including all of dan brown's.	1
	the lost symbol, his latest, is a disappointment on many levels.	1
	as i was plowing through the book, i kept thinking 'who cares what happens here?'	1
	the premise that masonic secrets could destroy the us government is so preposterous (when you find out what the secret is), that you end of hoping this secret is revealed.	1
	then there is the writing.	1
	brown spends a good portion of the book lecturing us on ancient truths, explaining these in pedantic deal.	1
	too many times there are references to robert langdon conducting his class, explaining what the masonic symbols mean.	1
	we are reminded about obelisks over and over, ad nauseum.	1
	and pyramids.	1
	and all this in a condescending tone.	1
	don't waste your money on this one.	1
	wait for the movie: it can only be better.      	1
	perfect for a new age fan.i am not a literary critic, nor am i a college lit major, so i will not comment on the quality of the writing or editing.	1
	if it wasn't good, i didn't notice.	1
	i was captured by learning about the existence of noetic science (which studies the power of thought); i was excited by all the the new age themes including unity consciousness, numerology, astrology, and the passing down of secrets since the days of the pyramids in egypt.	1
	i also liked learning about the free masons.	1
	i really appreciated the insights into the hidden meaning of the buildings in my nation's capital (check out william henry's website and his dvd: freedom's gate: decoding the secrets of america's temple of ascension for a visual journey through all of this information).	1
	best of all this novel supports my belief in the duality of humans (soul as a separate entity from the physical body and brain) and the possibility of humankind being able to create a better world using the focused thoughts of our mind.	1
	this book is a nail bitter, and i couldn't put it down for long.	1
	i highly recommend it to the new age crowd.      	1
	he has done it again.dan brown has once again made dance partners of the factual history and probable meaning of secret societies and suspense.	1
	i learned even more than i knew i wanted to know about the early american forefathers masonic backgrounds, while tracking through the book a madman with a twisted understanding of all of that.	1
	suspenseful and enlightening, and close to home as well, being about our national history and monuments.	1
	what more could i want?      	1
	sucked.the book sucked in so many ways and i don't care enough to write them all down.	1
	i just wanted to contribute this 1 star rating in hopes to prevent others the pain i endured.	1
	i was glad it was finally over.	1
	i really liked his other books - but this one doesn't come close.	1
	do not read!      	1
	a spiritual significance beyond the story.this is an exciting read, a hard-to-put-down book that i enjoyed even more than brown's previous novel, the da vinci code.	1
	there is one significant aspect, however, that transcends the intrigue of the story.	1
	the research that one of the characters is doing is more important than the tale itself.	1
	this is the practical spiritual message of the book.	1
	the research lab in the story is working to prove that 'human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass' (55).	1
	this suggests that concentrated thought can affect anything, such as 'the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swim in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish..., and the chemical reactions in one's own body' (56).	1
	these studies show that loving thoughts impact the structure of water and negative thoughts create a chaotic, disorderly form.	1
	the ideas come from ancient wisdom.	1
	there is more to this story, of course.	1
	there is the drama about what is hidden beneath a building in washington d.c. it would spoil the story to say more.	1
	what doesn't ruin the story, though, is the importance of brown's research.	1
	while some of it is based in fact and some may be simply his projections of possibilities, i feel there is a significance hidden in the pages that forces us, once again, to remember that the power is within us, not solely in some hidden symbol or object yet to be found.	1
	what is to be discovered may be what many already know, as brown suggests, that the power and secrets we search for are within. 	1
	problematic installment.i was on board for the whole story up until the end of the book, which i can't identify - it was supposed to be either a third act or a denouement (it is written as a screenplay in all except for format and the inclusion of unspoken thoughts).	1
	the author doesn't so much end the book as he does stop writing.	1
	all of the little logical gotchas that take you out of the story and draw attention to flaws in the plot - all that stuff is there in much greater force than in previous books.	1
	and the solution to the nominal goal - where is this mysterious staircase in d.c. under a great stone building - is telegraphed from the beginning.	1
	also malach's secret identity was obvious from the beginning of his backstory.	1
	the most interesting thing that keeps the pages turning is the little cryptogram contained in the masons' pyramid, but of course that turns out to be a huge letdown.	1
	i'd summarize the entertainment quality of this book like this: it was just barely worth my time, no regrets yet, but if dan brown's next book doesn't come back up to the level of craftsmanship i'm used to, that will be the end of my interest in his books.       	1
	a drag.i liked the da vinci code and angels and demons........but the lost symbol was the lost interest in dan brown for me.	1
	i had to force myself to finish the book.	1
	it was not a pager-turner it was a page too-many.	1
	what was the point?	1
	that washington was basically built as a city to praise god or the word with all the ancient wisdom is the bible.	1
	it was so heavy-handed on the symbol/jumbo and the masonic lore/ideals that i thought it was verging on a new age religious tract.	1
	blah!      	1
	good, fun read..the lost symbol is a fun read - typical dan brown.	1
	assuming you've read brown's other books, this one is no different in that the story grabs you from the beginning and quickly has you turning page, after page, after page.	1
	what's always enjoyable is brown's way of weaving truth and fiction together and this book has plenty of this.	1
	personally, and despite that i'm absolutely not an historian, it's easy to let your imagination wander with the imagery in the lost symbol.	1
	the level of detail and reference to actual high profile landmarks is one of the most exciting elements of this book.	1
	i will say at times the book does get a bit slow but that should be expected with any good piece of entertainment - it will have highs and lows.	1
	towards the end of the book, a few good surprises are thrown at you which you may or may not see coming - i definitely did not.	1
	i truly didn't have any expectations coming into the book which i think was beneficial.	1
	as often happens, when you have high (or low) expectations, they always never seem to live up to that standard.	1
	overall though, the book has all of the right elements, the characters are, as usual, fascinating and developed and the plot is palatable.	1
	i gave it four stars because i liked the book, as three stars is 'just ok' (at least according to amazon standards).	1
	keep an open mind as with any dan brown book, let your imagination run and you'll enjoy the piece.      	1
	another page turner from brown.when it comes to writing spellbing page turners, i put brown on the same level as one of my other favorite authors--sidney sheldon.	1
	for brown's latest book, i think it's best not to give away plot details.	1
	the reader should enjoy them first hand, and not become aware of them in a synopsis--let brown himself unfold his extraordinary story his way.	1
	but know this, you are in for a wild ride with unexpected twists and turns...is this book as great as davinci code?	1
	i'd have to honestly say no...but it comes very close!	1
	readers will not be disappointed with brown's latest literary offering.	1
	another page turner (for the holiday):  i could not put this book down!      	1
	fascinating, illuminating, totally entertaining.i was already a dan brown fan and so was eagerly awaiting the lost symbol.	1
	this book absolutely does not disappoint.	1
	it takes place over the course of about twelve hours, and through its pages, unfolds deep mystery after deep mystery.	1
	it has some great twists and turns, and keeps the suspense high the entire way through.	1
	i like that it also has an unusual format - there is the climax of the main story, but then the book allows you to keep unwrapping mysterious treasure after mysterious treasure for some time afterwards.	1
	i was truly sorry the book was finished.	1
	i felt like i had been given passage into a world of revelations that i wanted to continue, until i knew all there was to know.	1
	but that is not this book's job, that is now my own personal journey - to continue along the path that has been laid before me.	1
	and do so, i shall.	1
	i actually found the story very inspirational and illuminating in its message and it presented some concepts, chief amongst them noetic science, that i intend to keep studying.	1
	it is one of those books that can and does change the way you see and interact with the world around you.	1
	dan brown, in my opinion, is a master at telling compelling stories and teaching you all manner of incredibly fascinating things along the way.	1
	his books, the lost symbol, included, are loaded with information about some of the most mysterious and enigmatic parts of our history and culture.	1
	he presents ancient knowledge and myth in a new light and gets you thinking.	1
	he ignites interest in the past, in art, books, secret societies, scientific concepts and weaves all of those aspects into thrilling stories that are truly `unputdownable'.	1
	his tales tap into our imaginations and curiosity about the world around us.	1
	he says he writes stories that he finds personally entertaining and if the author is captivated and enchanted with what they are writing, that will come through in their work, as it does in the lost symbol.	1
	there is nothing disappointing about this book, it is well paced, has great characters that are truly alive, and a mystery at its core that kept me completely enthralled.	1
	the lost symbol is highly engaging, thoroughly entertaining, and is most certainly time well spent.	1
	let yourself be entertained and enlightened by this exciting novel.	1
	i hope it will grace the big screen in the not-too-distant future!	1
	rai aren, co-author of secret of the sands	1
	disappointing and dull.while i enjoyed 'the da vinci code' and 'angels and demons', it is clear from his newest work that he has become his own cliche.	1
	throughout the story, the 'ticking time bomb' is an impending threat against national security, requiring the intervention of cia black ops.	1
	but when the details of the threat are finally revealed to the reader near the end of the book, it turns out that at worst, it's a public relations scandal for a few politicians.	1
	nothing criminal by any means.	1
	much of the story revolves around protagonist robert langdon running around an historic city with a woman in tow trying to decipher symbolic clues imbedded in architecture and artwork from an antiquated and secretive organization.	1
	it's the same formula his previous langdon novels use.	1
	this time, instead of the catholic church or the knights templar/priory of scion, the organization in question is the order of freemasons.	1
	there is a lot of new age/new thought philosophy and theology dumped on the reader in classic dan brown style, but more heavy-handed this time.	1
	a mashup between 'da vinci code' and the movie 'what the bleep' might sound promising, but it falls flat in this novel.        	1
	a new success.dan brown's writing is like waving a wand that transports his readers into the story line.	1
	i know that the monuments in dc have a special significance and i love the way that mr. brown weaved it all together.	1
	i find myself talking to the book telling characters to hurry up or wait, don't do that.	1
	now this is a book!	1
	there are concepts in the book regarding being gods and being made in the image and likeness of god is what is taught in my church so i was glad to see it fused into the story line.	1
	these are simple truths that can be found in the bible but they are rarely, if ever, taught from the pulpit.	1
	i like how mr. brown put up front the facts that would be found in his book.	1
	but folks should research for themselves anyway.	1
	gotta' love dan brown and his style of writing!      	1
	really???	1
	?.this is what everyone was waiting for??	1
	this was the worst written 'bestseller' i have ever attempted to read.	1
	zero character development, horrendous conversational technique, one dimensional plot development.	1
	i can just see mr. brown dreaming of screenplay royalties dancing through his head as he wrote each 'chapter'.	1
	this could have been a mildly entertaining short story, but it turned into a dreadful full-length novel with the most disappointing (pointless?)	1
	ending imaginable.	1
	you would have expected something more after such a long period since the davinci code, but apparently mr. brown rested on his laurels for several years, then woke up one morning and pounded out his next 'book' (screenplay).	1
	shame on his editor and publisher.      	1
	are you kidding me?.so...after 2 other completely other out of the realm of normal experiences, robert landon still can't believe that there is some mysterious secret being protected by an age old secret society?	1
	really robert?	1
	while there is some interesting information in this book about freemasonry and historic symbolism, the writing itself is formulaic and unnecessarily over-dramatic.	1
	every other chapter ends with someone's terrifying interior revelation spelled out for you in italics.	1
	each piece of new information is started in one chapter, then not revealed until the next.	1
	while i don't expect these types of books to be high-brow literature, a little finesse would not hurt and a few less cheesy 'revelations' would certainly help.	1
	and as for the most horrible secret video that if revealed would be a threat to the security of the entire world - are you kidding me?	1
	after reading about all of the ridiculous things that public figures do every day and more or less get away with, as well as knowing what goes on in every fraternity / sorority initiation in the country, does anyone really believe that seeing our politicians enacting some silly old rituals would create chaos in the world?	1
	lame.	1
	dan brown did it again!.i read da vinci code and angels and demons before reading this one.	1
	both times, i was so enthralled by the stories that i wanted to pick up the books and read at stop lights!	1
	every spare second i had, i wanted my face in the books!	1
	when i saw that the lost symbol was released, i couldn't wait to read it.	1
	i wanted to see if dan brown could captivate me again!	1
	the history, humanity, tragedy, beauty, good vs. evil, twists and turns kept those pages turning!	1
	i tore through the book with voracity and could not rest until i reached the end!	1
	what an exciting, thrilling, enlightening, entertaining, and enjoyable book it was!	1
	brown forces the reader into somewhat of a quagmire:  tear through the book like i did, satisfying the curiosity that he continually evokes, or slowly savor the story and ponder the many details, delaying the persistent urge to know what happens next!	1
	my only complaint is that it ended!	1
	he did it again!      	1
	a matter of perspective.although i'd read the prior two books in this series, neither of them had the profound effect on me that this one did.	1
	having been a mason for over 30 years, i found the book to be a vehicle for publicly expressing any number of things that have been so misconstrued and carried forward about our fraternity in a negative fashion for decades.	1
	dan brown has taken a degree of painstaking research into our fraternity that is not only staggering but refreshingly delightful helping dispel so much of the 'hocus-pocus' that abounds about the masonic lodge.	1
	the comparisons so eloquently detailed in the book to masonic symbolism then compared to all of the major religions of the world is nothing short of something that has been known for eons but cloaked in the public's perception.	1
	overall, masonry has done a less-than-stellar job in defining itself over the last several decades, so accordingly, society has done it for us.	1
	the book takes this task to bear and, considering that it is public knowledge that dan brown is not a mason, it defines the very gravity of the organization.	1
	by his own admission dan brown could not have written the book if he was a mason.	1
	the reviews here are equally divided from bad to good and it may very well be that they were generated from the same origin - expecting something based on his prior works.	1
	although understandable, it is probably not entirely fair from either side.	1
	the lost symbol is a completely different work targeting a completely different objective.	1
	to begin with, it is a book that focuses on sending a message about life and spiritualism itself - not religion.	1
	for those expecting a plot liken unto his other works, it may indeed be somewhat disappointing.	1
	for those that expected his furtherance in outlining the spirit within all of us, it proved to be magnificent.	1
	finally, the look back into the visions that our forefathers had for our great country and the mindset they had as evidenced throughout the book was captivating to me and whether the author was trying to send a lesson for all of us as citizens to consider it too a mystery.	1
	i'm betting he was...	1
	the lost symbol.dan brown done it again... my hats off to the man that has done a outstanding job of reseach to create the fictional book with so mant true facts in it.	1
	abook you can't put down.	1
	can't wait for ron howard to make the movie version... a great buy aqnd on amazon a great price compared to bookstores, pick up a copy here.	1
	if you like dvd's on award winning movies check out this website [...] reg b.      	1
	save your money..looks like dan brown skipped writing the book and went straight to the screen play for a ho-hum movie.	1
	with any luck tom hanks will turn it down.      	1
	its a screenplay not a novel.i got very tired of the 'now it all made sense'.	1
	then you have to read another four chapters to see what made sense.	1
	i agree with the earlier reviews, that the editor needs to be fired.	1
	i am a big dan brown fan, yet langdon survives in da vinci code jumping out of a helicopter with a tarp.	1
	(which we all overlooked) this one has him 'drowning', then coming back to life.	1
	too many gimmicks, too little story.      	1
	mad-lib langdon story.this fomula is getting old.	1
	the last three books have all been the same type of set up, build up, and pay off.	1
	everyone is there.	1
	the friend, the known of, but not known too well daughter, the grumpy, questionable cop, the unknown bad guy, the looming danger, and the historically based mystery.	1
	dude, try telling a story in a different format.       	1
	philosophical suspense.while i find that the book was none the less entertaining i also think that any person that has a background in philosophy will appreciate the nods from dan brown, but with that they have moved past the ideas expressed in the book.	1
	his ideas are still interesting they just aren't new.	1
	i find that on the plus side is because of his ability to sell books these ideas are getting out there, from our founding fathers being deists to nods toward ancient wisdom i find that this book will probably stimulate people to look into the information he's supporting, and that i think is a very good thing.      	1
	this one flops.brown's first two books were 5 star.	1
	the next two (including this one) were bad.	1
	real bad.	1
	angels & lost are not worth reading.	1
	they are filled with page stretching nothingness and have endings that are so inconsistent with the build up in the books.        	1
	rushed mish mash that has a dud ending.i read this book and had hoped it would be as good as his davinci and angels/demons books.	1
	this was definitely not the case.	1
	i got it as a gift.	1
	if i had bought it i would have wanted my money back.	1
	packrat      	1
	a waste of time.......comic books have better plots and dialogue for crissakes.	1
	dan brown is way off on this one.	1
	purely done for the money.      	1
	sadly his best work is behind him.i used to wait excited for his new books; this one however has changed that.	1
	i will never purchase another perhaps rent from the library but i doubt it.	1
	lost symbol is boring!      	1
	this book was supposed to be called lost time.i try to finish every book i start, even if the book is less then thrilling or even mildly interested, i might skip pages or narratives but i finish it.	1
	this is more then i can say for this book, i had to stop before it drove me completely nuts.	1
	i cannot remember the last book as boring and bland as this one.	1
	there is make-believe uninteresting plot, personality-lacking main characters, people who can't give straight answers, and scenes after scenes of super boring masonic blabber that does not give any answers to any questions.	1
	anyone who ever read dan brown knows that he is not a good writer, so i did not expect him to improve with age.	1
	i know he goes to archives and copied pages of uninteresting tales and puts them in his book as is without editing or even trying to make them more appealing.	1
	however, even not expecting anything good, this so-called book was huge disappointment.	1
	there was one happy moment in the book when he killed langdon, i almost started to breath easy, but then he had to come up with crazy story and revived him.	1
	this is one truly terrible book, it will kill your vacation if take it to read on vacation, it will kill your weekend if you read it at home, it will make your train ride impossible, and if you listen to it on cd in your car - beware of accidents.	1
	skip this book; find a better author to read. 	1
	this is a very good and thought provoking book.this mega-bestseller has unfortunately and unfairly received mixed reviews.	1
	the reactions posted on amazon reflect the response.	1
	about 1500 people, an astounding number, expressed their opinions in an almost evenly divided manner; close to the same number of people gave 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 stars, although 503 handed the higher four or five stars, 686 offered the novel only one or two stars.	1
	why did so many people have problems with this book?	1
	apparently people focused on matters that they should have avoided.	1
	two things come to mind.	1
	first, people tend to look for faults rather than enjoy what is in front of them; they do so with life generally.	1
	this is more unsound than seeing a bottle half filled.	1
	pessimistic people with a half bottle of superb wine, who see it as being half empty rather than half filled, are still able to enjoy the wine.	1
	but people who look for faults end up tossing good wine - an excellent suspenseful novel in this case - into the trash can.	1
	sure, if one searches carefully one can find faults.	1
	yes, dan brown offers explanations of phenomenon which he says are the true reasons when scholars have a host of other ideas.	1
	for example, scholars recognize that we no longer know the meaning of the word amen and they offer many other speculative notions of its origin other than what our author proposes is the correct answer.	1
	it is true that the main reason why the ancients hid their opinions was not because they feared the ideas would be used to harm the world; they did so because they wanted to be helpful: they knew that the average person would be unable to understand the truth as they saw it and become confused.	1
	certainly, the meaning of malakh is 'messenger' and the biblical book of genesis speaks of a nefesh, and not a neshamah, as brown contends, and neither word means 'soul' when it is used in the hebrew bible, but 'life force.'	1
	sure, while most people feel that 'belief' is a religious requirement; most rationalists say that people should not give way to passive blind acceptance of irrational ideas, but that religion requires people to use their minds and improve themselves and the world.	1
	but, so what!	1
	this is a novel, not a dissertation.	1
	it was meant to be enjoyed.	1
	why not do so?	1
	if mr. brown uses the plural sefirot when he should have used the singular sefirah, so what?	1
	why not smile and move on?	1
	why not focus on the many many more ideas that dan brown presents correctly?	1
	why not use this book to provoke further thinking?	1
	why not simply enjoy the story?	1
	his ideas about noetic science are fascinating.	1
	his remark that the basic teaching of religion is respect of all people is correct.	1
	he is also right when he says that it is not enough to know the truth, the truth must be augmented through practice, through acts that help others.	1
	in short, those who approach this very fine book intending to find fault are missing a lot and are hurting themselves.	1
	the second problem seems to be that some people are turned off because mr. brown has a different concept of god and religion than what most people were taught as youngsters.	1
	but, perhaps he is correct and the childish notions most people hang onto are improper for adults.	1
	however, even if he is wrong, so what?	1
	this is a novel and should be enjoyed. 	1
	the important 'facts' in the 'fiction'.an overriding theme in dan brown's writing is: secrets are bad.	1
	whether it's the masons, opus dei, or the catholic church in general, there don't seem to be any redeeming qualities in protecting secrets.	1
	in fact, none of the secrets once revealed and understood are as frightening or shocking as those addicted to secrecy, power, and control woud have us believe.	1
	his personal statement might be this simple, 'isn't it time we're all honest with each other?'	1
	if we were, his hope for a better world, as well as ours, would have a decent chance of being realized.	1
	many of the conclusions in his novels seem very redemptive.	1
	while an ill-adapted few are searching to find faults in his facts, most readers are able to see a wider and more authentic interpretation of reality in his fiction.        	1
	this is the kind of book....this is the kind of book that you keep looking at how much longer is left because you hate it, but you have invested so much time and money that you have to see it through to the end.      	1
	disappointing, full of factual errors, completely unbelievable.while this isn't the worst book i have ever read, it ranks right down there.	1
	the errors in the beginning of the book spoiled the beginning, and complete implausibility of the rest of it made the book a struggle to read through.	1
	never read dan brown before, and am not likely to ever again.	1
	i could write better than this on my worst day.	1
	if you must try to read it, get a library copy or borrow a friend's.	1
	it's certainly not worth paying money for.       	1
	pushing the limits of plausibility.i have enjoyed the books in dan brown's da vinci code series, but am unlikely to buy a 4th if one comes along.	1
	brown's pacing is good, and the book is a fun read, but i never really bought in to the underlying premises.	1
	the story and situations seemed contrived, and the mythology seemed forced.	1
	in the end, i found myself thinking, 'really?	1
	that's it?'.	1
	worth reading, but pick it up at the library and read it for free.      	1
	really bad, dan.	1
	really.oh, really, dan??	1
	i do not give this book one star!!	1
	read the other one-star reviews and comments on this site and maureen dowd's review in the new york times.	1
	they pretty much sum up this hopeless book for me.	1
	i could not finish reading it.	1
	really.	1
	a bad book, really.	1
	do not waste your money or time.       	1
	disappointing.a rambling book of ridiculous scenarios, which is a terrible follow up to the da vinci code.	1
	it starts out bad and gets progressively worse where by the end it is a series of ever more preposterous settings.	1
	it will take real work to get through the book.	1
	it appears dan brown can, at this point sell anything he writes, but if he puts out many more like this one, his books will be a hard sell.      	1
	worth a read, but only if you don't mind a lecture.the lost symbol is about what you would expect as a years-late follow-up to da vinci code: a formula that works and keeps you turning the pages, shallow characters and plenty of suspense and action.	1
	but two things drag this book down:1. the plot that you read his books for winds up tightly as you would expect, but then you get 45 pages of drivel that try to tie up loose ends and make the make arc of the story relevant to your spirituality.2.	1
	brown's treatment of masons goes beyond the casual and intriguing education that you read his books for and digresses into infatuation, glorification and justification of their traditions.	1
	i knew little about masons before reading this and now feel like i know less.	1
	i'm glad i read this as an easy, fast-paced thriller, but by the end i felt like i was reading dianetics.      	1
	truth, fiction, and lies.this book, while entertaining, is fiction, yet it highlights the true involvement of masonry in the foundation of our nation.	1
	while it is an entertaining read, as dan brown points out symbols, codes, and clues to the mason mind set, his fictional story points out the seemingly hidden yet obvious intentions of secret societies.	1
	secret orders like the golden dawn, illuminati, rosicrucians, and others have all been infused with mystical cult ideas from hermeticism.	1
	(hermeticism is a false teaching which includes both panentheism and monistic-polytheism and it promotes the notion that other beings such as gods and angels, ascended masters and elementals exist in the universe as parts of the all.)	1
	many false teachers promote the heretical hermetical slogan, 'as above, so below.'	1
	this occult teaching misleads people and gives them false hopes!	1
	one should read the bible before reading this or other books like this to understand the truth about jesus, the universe, creation, and the gospel of salvation brought to humankind.	1
	this is quite a fictional story laced with truth about secret orders, their codes, secrets, rituals, meanings and how they influenced, and continue to influence, powerful people in our nation and other nations of the world.	1
	the final chapters of this book are dan brown's attempt to promote the new, (and old), age philosophy of man becoming god.	1
	dan uses quotes from the bible and blends them skillfully with untruths.	1
	he tries to link all religions and science together as a path for man becoming god.	1
	this subtle infusion and intermingling of truth with fiction will, sadly, fool many people!	1
	jesus said, 'i am the way, the truth, and the life.'	1
	the way to heaven is through jesus!	1
	those who think they are becoming god, by using their mind over matter, to gain wealth, power, and position are only fooling themselves.	1
	our only hope and salvation is in christ jesus!      	1
	good read.i always thought that dan brown would retire to some deserted island after the success of 'the da vinci code.'	1
	there he would sit on the beach and sip pina coladas.	1
	i'm sure the favorable response the film received and some prodding from tom hanks got mr. brown back in writer's mode.	1
	you might compare 'the lost symbol' to indiana jones meets 'national tresure.'	1
	years ago mark frost wrote a novel titled 'the list of 7.'	1
	in it arthur conan doyle pursues the freemasons in london.	1
	coincidence?	1
	another fascinating read if you enjoy the genre.       	1
	overblown expectations.i bought this book despite the negative reviews here and i'm glad i did.here are two reasons why reviewers were so tough on this one.---1.	1
	)it seemed obvious to me that the negative critics of this bookwould not have been satisfied unless dan browns next book described (in detail) how jesus never really walked on water.failing that of course,would mean that brown had failed in this his latest attempt.---2.	1
	)there is also the aspect that, everyone gets their t*ts in an uproar when it comes to religionand everyone has an opinion on religion.the da vinci code and angels and demons gave everyone a platform on which to vent.	1
	consequently the ability of this book to stand on it's ownmerit didn't have a chance.jusy my opinion.p.s.since when does information(if it is interesting)that is notdirectly related to the plot mean that it can't be inserted just for it's informative worth?	1
	ancient mysteries, secret societies and technology.this book combines all of the elements of his other books in a new setting and with mostly new versions of secret societies and ancient symbols and architecture designed with hidden meanings targeted for those in the know.	1
	dan brown uses the same techniques to keep you reading and these work well as the book went quickly for me without any lags in interest.	1
	professor langdon with his eidetic memory and exhaustive knowledge on ancient symbols makes a heroic appearance once again and finds himself pitted against a very crafty villain willing to use the greatest evil towards his ends.	1
	the setting is washington, dc and there is interesting information about the city throughout.	1
	dan brown tries to touch on major philosophical issues such as the soul and life after death and his reach might be a little too broad.	1
	maybe he should save some of these themes for another book.	1
	the only criticism (a mild one) is that i kept wondering how in the world the villain could pose a grave national threat or an international one.	1
	when the reasons came out i can't say i was particularly convinced.	1
	all in all this is great entertainment though.	1
	good job, dan brown.good job, dan brown!	1
	i know you put a lot of thought into this book, and i appreciate it!	1
	i was hooked all the way through.	1
	and there were plenty of hooks!	1
	you did a good job of walking several tightropes when writing this book.	1
	you treated the masons, religions, searchers of deeper meanings, smart readers, and not-so-smart readers equally well.	1
	and once again, you've educated me in areas in which i've been ignorant, or too casually informed.	1
	thanks for an exciting read!      	1
	should have been called 'the lost hours'.for the time that i will never get back after reading this book.	1
	i took the reviews with a grain of salt before i purchased the book.	1
	maybe next time i'll believe them.      	1
	it's so slow and badly in need of a good editor.i'm on page 157 and wondering how much more of this i can manage.	1
	loved angels and demons, liked da vinci code but this one should have not been written or at least written differently.	1
	i'll probably give up soon as i have another book waiting for me and i feel like i'm wasting my time on this one as it's not going anywhere and the dialogue is really weak for such high placed characters.        	1
	disappointed.i'm shocked at this book's writing.	1
	not reccommending this book to anyone.	1
	from 1 to ten i give it a zero.	1
	very, very dosappointed with story the way it was written.       	1
	don't waste your money.	1
	not up to par.i  have read all of dan brown's work and am somewhat disappointed with this one.	1
	i am having a hard getting started and it is just is not up to his usual standards.        	1
	disappointing.not in the same category as the da vinci code or angels & demons.	1
	while the 'bad guy' in lost symbol was truly grotesque and evil, the rest of the characters were not memorable.	1
	and, sadly, robert langdon seems to have been lobotomized since we last saw him.      	1
	grabs your attention, conclusion disappoints.......i'll be brief, dan brown had a winner with the da vinci code, entertaining, entertaining, and entertaining to the end.	1
	the lost symbol gets you going but the conclusion is as disappointing as i never could imagine; a lot of preaching, absolutely no satisfaction.       	1
	very disappointed....although is still enjoy his writing style, i found the plot in this novel to be lacking.	1
	the ending was a drag.      	1
	he ran out of steam after davinci code.i only read the lost symbol because i liked davinci code.	1
	it was as if brown knew he could not top d.c. but he wanted to keep writing.	1
	lost symbol has none of the flavor of d.c. it was as if brown had paid a ghostwriter.	1
	i was very disappointed to say the least.	1
	i will not be reading his next book even if the movie, lost symbol, turns out to be as good as d.c.  a movie only asks me to invest 90 or so minutes.	1
	the book took too many hours from my life that i can't get back.      	1
	good entertainment.i found this book to be quite entertaining.	1
	brown developed a nice range of characters to express an 'enlightened' response in contrast to a character that represents a powerful challenge to such views.	1
	it was certainly enough to supply me with an adequately engaging reading experience, and the presentation is sufficiently careful with respect to 'facts' that it weaves a fairly coherent adventure.	1
	i like the way that he is able to take the protagonist, the professor langdon, through a kind of metaphorical journey, and is even able to kill him and resurrect him in a way that is plausible.	1
	in fact, it is enjoyable to see how the author can pose problems for his unfolding tale that one thinks would superficially involve magic or the supernatural, and instead invoke science or historical knowledge as plausible explanations without stretching one's imagination into the obvious directions of the supernatural or magic.	1
	to my mind, he is able to show how closely science represents the modern replacement for religion and magic for the 'enlightened' mind.	1
	(even to the extent of attempting to delineate a kind of 'good' vs 'evil' within this context of modernity.)	1
	of course, posing riddles and solving them in this way, and weaving symbolism into modern science, as he does, has its cost in terms of a certain overall unconvincingness and superficiality.	1
	but i consider it a good enough book to be worth the effort to read.      	1
	predictable, but interesting.the book was action packed... but the plot kept hinting at more... in the end i'd already predicted the 'more' and it was kinda flat.	1
	the highlight of the book for me was learning about the traditions of freemasons and who they were.	1
	also there were some incredible science/research mysteries that i will definatly want to hear more about!	1
	bottom line, it was a good book, better if it hadn't followed divinci code.	1
	looking forward to the next one dan!      	1
	blah..i read the book because i am a freemason and was curious how mr. brown would portray masonry.	1
	he did it accurately, hence the three stars.	1
	other than that, the book was not a very exciting read.      	1
	couldn't finish it was so bad........the book started out with yet another mystery that could easily be solved.	1
	i found myself skipping a majority of the book after i easily discovered the son was the strange man behind all the trouble.	1
	after 100 pages it became nothing more than water cooler gossip.	1
	can you sound smarter than your coworker if you know about the freemason's????	1
	dan brown is nothing more than entertainment before you fall asleep on the airplane.	1
	i find it shocking that so many american's read his work.....yet they also voted for barry obama!!!!!	1
	!      	1
	same story...again.if you've read a number of mr. brown's stories (as i have) you'll notice a haunting similarity.	1
	it's the same story he's written at least four other times: a big, mysterious organization (nasa, nsa, catholic church [twice]) has the power and will to control the lives of the little guy, and someone will figure out what it all really means.	1
	fill in the blanks.	1
	*yawn* pass on this one and wait for danny to write a new story in the future.      	1
	missing the thrill of the davinci code.the historical information is interesting, but the thrill is missing.	1
	the villain was not so scary, and the ending was drawn out and unsatisfying.      	1
	the lost symbol.i found the book very difficult to get into.	1
	long chapters, extrordinary detail.	1
	just not my cup of tee.      	1
	very disappointed.i was a fan of dan brown before he achieved fame with the davinci code.	1
	unfortunately this is not one of his better novels.	1
	symbologist robert langon finds himself embroiled with the cia  in washington, d.c. in an attempt to stop a madman who has infiltrated the freemasons, and as a result has acquired knowledge that not only supposedly threatens national security, but also to expose the freemasons' most  cherished secret.	1
	without giving anything away, let me say that the alleged threat to national security is something that in real life the cia could probably figure out how to deal with in about five seconds if it ever occurred, while the cherished secret revealed at the end of the novel seemed like a wisp of smoke, namely, not much of a secret at all.	1
	the novel does provide lots of details about the freemasons and their influence on architecture in washington d.c.--often to the detriment of the action in the novel by bogging the reader down in unnecessary details.	1
	brown also  spends inordinate amounts of time 'preaching' about the tension between science and religion.	1
	finally, while brown introduces the reader to  noetics, under which thoughts can affect actions, he does so in a very superficial way.	1
	unlike a good michael crichton novel, for example, where a scientific concept is explored creatively, brown clearly lacks either the scientific background or interest to do that in this novel.	1
	while this novel does contain lots of action, brown often stretchs the bounds of plausibility, such as when the cia sends but a single agent to the location where the madman may be found.	1
	further, i agree with the reviews that say this novel is too long.	1
	finally, given the short chapters and some of the dialogue, i also agree with the reviews that say brown was really writing a screenplay rather than a novel.	1
	bottom line: this novel reminded me of the proverbial booth at a carnival promising that if you pay to go inside behind the curtain you will see something extraordinary--yet inside there is nothing extraordinary at all, and after going to the end of the booth you feel as if you have been had.	1
	that was exactly how i felt at the end of this novel.	1
	non-science nonsense.i enjoyed dvc and ad but this was just too much.	1
	the whole premise dealing with katherine's 'research' is just so much nonsense i couldn't stomach it.       	1
	save yourself.sadly, i bought the lost symbol when it first came out and the amazon rating was 5 stars.	1
	i should have waited for a few other brave readers to weigh in so the rating would be closer to reality.	1
	read the 1 and 2-star reviews and they all pretty well sum it up.	1
	the book is long, slow and reads more like a history book with a paragraph of plot advancement every couple of pages.	1
	i assume the history, and details around the masons, is correct.	1
	that was interesting for a while, but it got to be too much.	1
	the description of pod 5 was absurd.	1
	a giant warehouse with a lab in the back corner.	1
	the warehouse is too big to heat, so it's cold when you enter.	1
	that's fine, but also dark???	1
	the lab workers have to cross the expanse (a 90 second walk) in complete darkness?	1
	seriously?	1
	boeing manages to put lights in their massive warehouses.	1
	why couldn't this company?	1
	i won't spoil it, but it turns out there is a lame reason why it's pitch black.	1
	at one point langdon needs to call kathrine, but doesn't have her phone number.	1
	he calls a 3rd party to get her number and calls her cell.	1
	when the incoming call comes through she glances at her cell phone and the caller id tells her it's robert langdon.	1
	that would be pretty cool if cell phone actually had caller id, but as of yet, they don't.	1
	all in all, it's probably not a horrible book.	1
	i was hoping for something comparable to dvc, so i was sorely disappointed.        	1
	boring,boring,boring.do not bother to buy this book.	1
	it is predictable and langdon was a character that i do not even like anymore.	1
	the ending was preachy and went on and on.	1
	don't think i will buy another dan brown book until after it has been out for a while so i can read other reviews before spending money.      	1
	disappointed.although i didn't appreciate the way the davinci code weaved together fact and fantasy regarding christianity, it was an extremely captivating novel.	1
	this title again features the main character robert langdon.	1
	this time he is uncovering truths of the masons hidden within washington, d.c.  for anyone who has any knowledge of the masonic lodge, it is evident that brown returns to his pattern of weaving together accurate information with dramatic license.	1
	with this book however, his plot is rather dull and simply too far-fetched to keep the reader engaged.	1
	perhaps there was just too much pressure to write a second novel that possesses movie-making potential.	1
	regardless, i was disappointed with this one.	1
	it may sell a lot of copies, but the reason will be more because of the preceding title rather than the content found here.      	1
	five years to create - what a waste, dan!.this comment is addressed to mr. brown (and his readers, hopefully, soon to be less): i am a voracious reader and was looking forward to your new novel.	1
	i received a gift certificate for my birthday from my daughter and preordered the book from amazon - what a waste!!	1
	- not only of my daughter's money, but of my time.	1
	i read the novel to the very end and never found anything new, provocative or interesting.	1
	as a matter of fact, your style was stilted and unimaginative and the story line ridiculous - a total rehash of your previous writing.	1
	mr. brown, i would like my money back (i will return your book) so that i can buy an excellent book by another author.	1
	you have convinced me to never preorder a book again - it seems that the many reviews i have since read have been right on target.	1
	you and your publisher should be ashamed for probably spending millions of dollars on advertising for such an insipid book - no wonder publishing is dying - no one can trust either the publisher or author - money rules!!	1
	to reiterate the new york times review of october 11, 2009 (which i wish i had read two weeks ago) - 'what the hell, dan?'	1
	most disappointing.when i started to read the book i thought 'wow - this story is really gripping!'.	1
	unfortunately the whole book is on a steady downslope and the ending is the most frustrating part of it.	1
	the characters are improbable and unbelievable.	1
	what with all the patriotic statements ('our great nation, the crossroads of this great nation,...) and the totally misleading 'explanation' of how and why waterboarding is 'so effective' i was wondering if dick cheney had ghost-written at least part of the book.	1
	plus langdon and his lady-friend do some really cool sight-seeing in washington towards the end - the rising sun reflects off the top of the washington monument, wow, there is a really stunning ending to a story.i did not like it.      	1
	boring.i was incredibly disappointed in this book.if you are expecting anything as exciting as angels and demonns or  the da vince code forget it.	1
	dont pay a penny for this book if you must read  it go to the library.      	1
	as believable as a comic book.i thoroughly enjoyed the da vinci code but the lost symbol is just a very long comic book without all the illustrations.        	1
	lost symbol.	1
	only worth half a star.do yourself a favor.	1
	save your money.	1
	it will be coming to your garage or yard sale soon.	1
	then don't buy it!	1
	shody writing, pseudo science, but not nearly interesting as tv's 'fringe'.	1
	in fact, watch 'fringe' it is much more entertaining.      	1
	too much of too little..the lost symbol is over written and under edited.	1
	the plethora of aha!	1
	moments just become so what?      	1
	a writer of many words and no surprises.i did not like the book but i will pay to see the movie if linda hunt gets the role of sato.my late mother read all her life sometimes three to four books a week.	1
	in her later years she told me 'editors should not allow books to be longer than 350 pages.	1
	i suspect those writers who exceed that number are paid a great deal of money for each word.'	1
	it was at about page 35o, after i had already figured out the whole thing, with every turn of the page i whispered to myself and dan brown 'you can stop now.'	1
	i finished it hoping i had been wrong all along.	1
	no such luck.	1
	a really lack luster book.	1
	the publisher must have had to shell out a lot of money for those last 159 pages as there are a lot of words there and so very many of them unnecessary.	1
	every writer should be forced to read willa cather.	1
	not a wasted word.	1
	if you are looking for a great read try the last report on the miracles of little no horse or the plague of doves both by louise erdrich.      	1
	nonspoiler: sampling of dan brown's best and worst.i've read dan brown's other books, and the lost symbol provides both the best and worst characteristics of his writing.	1
	the good: brown clearly puts a great deal of effort into collecting mysterious buildings and artifacts which people walk past without giving another thought and imbues them with hidden meaning.	1
	he then weaves them together into a single plot and slowly unravels it, giving the reader a feeling that he/she has somehow become enlightened about the world/city/church/whatever.	1
	he apparently does considerable research, and this lends an air of credibility to the real-life portions of his novels, which he then stretches to cover the fictional plot.	1
	this requires not only skill at presenting a tale, but creativity to weave all these parts together.	1
	in doing this, he has a talent for making people want to learn more about the world around them, and this is a good effect to have.	1
	the bad: while it's a decent story to tell, the pacing of the telling was way off.	1
	this leads to a long period in which it is hard for the reader to immerse in the story.	1
	it just isn't a must-finish story for the first.... let's say half.	1
	then it gets more exciting, and then it somehow stalls out.	1
	the reveal was disappointing for me, because it was so built up.	1
	i don't have a problem with the overall resolution to the mysteries, but it just felt unworthy of the danger and energy which was poured into the mid-portion of the book.	1
	the climax of the story felt rushed and confusing.	1
	this is not unique to brown, but when it happens, i can tell how i feel about a book if (as in the lost symbol) i do not go back to re-read how the story ended up at the confusing part.	1
	i just didn't want to invest the effort in the explanation, and maybe the author felt that way writing it.	1
	motivations of some characters are needlessly hidden.	1
	this appears to be so that at the end, brown has more substance to reveal.	1
	but i didn't have a 'wow' moment for most of these, just a 'oh, that makes some sense' feeling.	1
	additional note:it's nice to see a dan brown novel where the catholic church (or a sect of it) is not portrayed in a sinister light.	1
	wonder if the criticism got to brown.	1
	either way, he's avoided alienating some people.	1
	while it differs in terms of buildings, mysteries, and just about everything, the fact that it dealt with the founding of the nation must inevitably invoke the national treasure movies.	1
	that's too bad because brown doesn't really deserve to start out with someone else's work in you head, but when a movie is as successful as that, it is very hard to avoid.	1
	also, the movie was more exciting, so readers may get to the end and be disappointed by comparison to the movies.	1
	overall, it was just ok.  glad i read it, but wish i hadn't expected more.	1
	maybe he should have released it under a different name. 	1
	huge letdown in the end.sometimes i think authors write books more like screenplays and this book is no exception.	1
	as far as the horrible ending (think self-help book ending), it was worse than most endings i have ever read.	1
	not a complete waste of ink and trees, but close.      	1
	a disappointment.i read all other books from dan brown; so, i was excited to buy this one as soon as it was available.	1
	i was very disappointed after about 100 pages into it.	1
	it seems dan brown is running out of new ideas.	1
	it would be an okay book to read if you never read other dan brown books or any book relates to symbolism.	1
	he's getting so predictable in his plots.      	1
	totally contrived.i loved the davinci code.	1
	as preposterous as the plot was, the people in the story behaved in normal ways.	1
	in the lost symbol however, at the end the characters behave not like they had just been put through hell by a maniac but like they were trying to one-up each other with lectures.	1
	of course, brown had to do this to get his lessons out into the book through dialog, but seriously.	1
	you've just been through hell, both physically and mentally, and instead of going to a hospital you go on a sight-seeing tour of d.c.?	1
	come on!	1
	this book was a great page turner up to a point.	1
	but when i found out what the 'national security' matter was, i was appalled.	1
	brown really thinks people would care about that so much that it was worth the cia's time to protect?	1
	really?	1
	it's as though brown just couldn't think of anything better.	1
	everything after the climactic events with the villain was horrible, it felt like brown was preaching.	1
	and i have yet to figure out why the pyramid needed to be protected when the secret was something the world already knows.	1
	i will not be reading anything by this author in the future.      	1
	this book is no 'da vinci code'....it is boring..i don't pretend to know much about all the subjects this book has kicked up, but i do know what i like.	1
	i did not like this book.	1
	i was very disappointed.	1
	it was boring.	1
	i hope author brown does better next time, if he doesn't i don't think he will have much of a fan base left.	1
	the lost symbol.terrible.	1
	terrible.	1
	brown should be ashamed.	1
	this book is a fairy tale a boring one at that.	1
	not what we are expected, a shock to see how low he can go.      	1
	when did langdon become such a doubting thomas!.one would think that with all robert langdon experienced in 'the da vinci code' and 'angles and demons', he'd be a bit more open-minded and willing to believe anything is possible.	1
	not so.	1
	his stock comment in 'the lost symbol' seems to be 'it's a myth'.	1
	after the fourth or fifth time, that phrase begins to grate on the nerves.	1
	and why are we constantly being told that katherine 'tucks her hair behind her ear'?	1
	grate, grate, grate.	1
	interesting theory, interesting facts, interesting premise, but pales by comparison to 'the da vinci code'.	1
	then again, should we compare it?	1
	perhaps not; perhaps it should stand or fall on its own merit.	1
	too bad langdon's new-found attitude drags 'symbol' down.	1
	still a worthwhile read, but not a five-star edge-of-the-seater.      	1
	entertaining.i think some of the reviewers are too hard on brown's novel, the lost symbol.	1
	brown has definitely caught on to the power of what people are reaidng in the more esoteric parts of book stores these days...positive thoughts, manifestation, power of thoughts etc.	1
	i totally see the formulaic writing he uses however not everyone in the world wants to have to have a dictionary close by to understand the novel.	1
	i am only part of the way through the novel and really enjoying the story.	1
	when i get bored i skim a few paragraphs and it gets interesting again quickly.	1
	i truly dislike some of the characters and dislike how some are portrayed.	1
	this is how an author uses their craft to create a story that keeps people turning pages.	1
	the villain gives me the chills.	1
	the 'heroine' makes me proud that brown can portray a woman as not only brilliantly smart but sexy as well.	1
	i am enjoying this novel as much as the di vinci code.	1
	i think it is a fun read.	1
	i would tell my friends to enjoy.        	1
	slightly better than garbage.when you write a book like the davinci code, which i loved, it is very hard to follow and all follow ups will be judged against it.	1
	however, this book must be judged by its own merits and not compared to brown's prior novels.	1
	this is slightly better than garbage, but not much.	1
	it is not thrilling, it is contrived and way too much detail paid to people's breathing, walking, useless past and relationships.	1
	one scene in particular, that took place in the capitol that in 'real time' probably took 30 minutes had 30% of the book describing it-on top of that it was interspersed with more useless babbling about past scenes of no or little connection to the characters or storyline.	1
	this is a book to skim if you feel must have it.	1
	my recommendation, don't waste your time on this garbage-slightly better than garbage that is.      	1
	predictable pattern.i was one of the people that bought the book the first day it came out, having read 'the da vinci code' and 'angels and demons' and enjoyed both books.	1
	i got the book to keep me occupied and interested for some long plane rides while en route to vacation.	1
	the book started off alright, but eventually i found the pattern of events predictable and almost as if brown used the same format (or outline) as he did for the previous 2 books in terms of plot progression, characters etc.	1
	i found the dialogue so fake and unrealistic.	1
	i found the cia deputy director character annoyingly cliche and ridiculous (the smoking, the harsh orders, the way she spoke, how she acted etc.).	1
	the villain was also cliche and lacked real depth in terms of motivation the reader could understand.	1
	his motivation was dubious, ranking somewhere along the lines as just mentally unstable which is easily dismissed as a reader.	1
	the end was anticlimactic, i found myself not even caring how it ended and skimmed through to the end to see if anything good was actually going to happen, any interesting insights or revelations.	1
	sad to say, there wasn't.	1
	it was all either cliche, preachy, or some apparent imitation of the other previous 2 well-known books.	1
	i was disappointed to say the least.	1
	dan brown is a smart, knowledgeable author and much of that knowledge came through in the book as various plot details unfolded.	1
	but the basic premise for the villain and then ending was just not that thrilling or interesting as the book progressed.  	1
	disappointed..i read this in one sitting, but found it did not live up to expectations.	1
	perhaps, after all the hype, i was expecting more.	1
	either way, slightly disappointing, although certainly not unreadable.      	1
	ya-a-a-a-wn.i was expecting  a book to keep me on the dge of my seat but instead had trouble keeping my eyes open.	1
	there is some action in the last third of the book but i really got turned off by the religious hokum at the end.      	1
	tripe all dressed up.dan brown has run out of gas or rather he has run out of writers to plagarize as he did in the davinci code where he took holy blood, holy grail almost verbatim and breathlessly exposed each of its' revelations as his own.	1
	while i thoroughly enjoyed that effort, this one leaves me cold.	1
	the plot is like a 'mad lib'.	1
	all the elements of davinci code are present; the names and places are changed.	1
	we waited how many years for this?      	1
	great at times but very predictable.if any of you have read the previous books then i assure you that you'll be able to predict everything that will happen in this book.	1
	it follows the exact same formula than the da vinci code.	1
	there was only one thing that i wasn't really expecting, but that was ruined when dan brown turned the moment into a hollywood moment.	1
	if you haven't read any of the books where robert langdon appears, then you'll probably enjoy the book.	1
	it will keep you interested most of the times and it's a fun and easy read.	1
	also if you haven't read any of the past rober langdon books, then you'll probably won't find this book as predictable.	1
	i'd recommend the book since you can probably read it in 2-3 days, but don't expect it to wow you.       	1
	not as good.the lost symbol was another one of dan brown's page turners the ending, however, was flat and disappointing.	1
	the villains identity was a shocker.	1
	but much of the book itself was praise and adoration for the masonic lodges.	1
	after reading it i wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone.      	1
	not worth the wait.even though the da vinci code was certainly not historically accurate, it was loads of fun.	1
	the lost symbol is simply ludicrous, repetitive, and no fun at all.	1
	the plot is ridiculous, the identity of the 'bad guy' is obvious, the characterization is very weak, and the writing is atrocious.	1
	i could not even finish it without skimming through the last 200 pages.	1
	the big revelation at the end is such a letdown!	1
	i got my copy at the library and suggest you do the same, or maybe just skip it completely.       	1
	3.5, actually.at the very core of dan brown intrigue is his ability to blend fact and fiction in a way not many others can do well.	1
	he is exceptionally good at it.	1
	he seems to have a formula - whether you love it or hate it.	1
	the general plot revolves around robert langdon getting sucked into a world full of symbolic riddles in washington dc that only he holds the key  to solve.	1
	there's a smart, beautiful (emotionally unavailable)woman unknowingly in the center of the excitment.	1
	also don't forget a disturbed person with unusual physical attributes, who gets the evil ball rolling.	1
	and that's brown's basic formula: langdon, woman, evil guy, and a couple of folks that could go either way -  all wraped in a symbolic package racing against a proverbial clock.	1
	there is nothing wrong with the formula - it works well.	1
	in fact it offers a fast paced adventure through dc via masonic symbolism and secrets.	1
	langdon is exactly the same guy he was in previous installments (consistencey is great).	1
	brown writes this like it's a screen play, which is fine with me, i enjoy the pace and cinematic details.	1
	all and all it's entertaining and you do learn a little more about an under stated scientific study (noetics) and symbolism.	1
	it would be difficult to say that the lost symbol is as original as da vinci code or angels & demons--- but brown has knack for this fact bending genre.	1
	however it seems the masons are a familiar target for movies, books & general conspiract theories in the past several years.	1
	on a side note, i read many other reviews -- why all the 'haters'?	1
	if you don't like brown's fomula, then don't buy his books.	1
	it looked like there was a race to see who could bash this book first.	1
	no it's not high brow literature, i don't think anyone ever claimed that it was-- brown writes for entertainment purposes.      	1
	predictable and deceptive.dan brown begins his novels with a prescribed fact sheet and rides his agenda through deception and distortions in a simplistic, predictable manner.	1
	1/3 of the way through the novel, the reader is led to believe peter's son begins his rejection/abandonment metamorphasis from a physical prison to one that engulfs him physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, cognitively and relationally.	1
	how trite to have evil die from glass shards falling from heaven while claiming world religions share one truth.       	1
	expecting more - all the righ parts - poor execution.as many of you, i was an instant dan brown fan after reading the davinci code.	1
	soon there after, i read his previous novels in reverse order of publication only to be more disappointed with each novel.	1
	my thought then was, and it should stand to reason, that the lost symbol would be amazing.	1
	i am sorry to report, however, that the lost symbol rates below angels and demons on my 'liking' scale.	1
	question: what went wrong?	1
	it was all there; the story line, the research, the protagonist, the antagonist, the urgency - everything!	1
	answer: the presentation and execution were almost; terrible.	1
	while there were moments where i found myself in a 'davinci-like' trance and unable to set the book down, those moments were far too few and far between.	1
	there was a real sense of disconnection within the text.	1
	it is almost as thought there were three separate writing/creative sessions if you will.	1
	the first part of the novel was slow to develop and not very captivating from a reader's perspective.	1
	the middle section - which is by far the best from a flow and interest perspective - had a very different feel than the other two.	1
	and lastly, the third section, or last 60 - 70 pages, were completely disparate and could be omitted.	1
	i would even be so bold as to say the experience would have been more pleasing to me had they not been included.	1
	this is not the first time my expectations were not met; shame on me, i just was expecting more... 	1
	dc reader:  local excitment turns sour.slight spoiler alert  i certainly didn't expect this to be as magical as the davinci code, and while living in rome, angels and demons was an amazing experience.	1
	i enjoyed parts of it but i have 3 major complaints about this book.	1
	number one, its repetitive, it seems ever 3-4 chapters robert langdon is 'shocked' by the discoveries made that he original thought to be myth, the villian continues to admire his body and fuel his hatred (which i still don't quite understand how he went so crazy, its a little out there).	1
	number two, the ending was 20 pages too long.	1
	the book built up to this fantastic climax that was more like a slanted down-hill plateau, it just didn't justify the build-up.	1
	number three, even living in dc for 5 years there are so many things that i continue to discover that a just cool.	1
	my intrest with dan brown is the way he finds things that are real and adds a component of magical mystery.	1
	he chose the masonic temple in dc?	1
	that'd be the first place i'd look to pick up the trail and i know nothing.	1
	there are so many mysteries in dc i just wanted more than the washington monument and the masonic temple.	1
	the capitol scenes were okay but still a little dry.      	1
	the lost plot.i enjoyed the davinci code and had high expectations for lost symbol.	1
	we were led on a thrill packed ride through washington dc, which was a great adventure worthy of a successor to davinci code.	1
	the plot however was a major let down, leaving a very hollow feeling after reading the book.	1
	the (theatrically bad) villain is planning to commit some terrible deed, could this be a wmd, the opening of a portal to some other dimension, a plague of alien creatures........... no wait - he's going to release a discovery channel video about freemasons.  	1
	yes it's got suspense, but it lacks the quality of earlier works.i looked forward to this book for a long time.	1
	while i did read it fast, in about a week, just because it is an easy read, doesn't make it a great one.	1
	i would compare this book to a james patterson book (from the last ten years), short chapters, alot of suspense but very little substance.	1
	the da vinci code was packed with interesting information on the history of christianity but this book failed to deliver on the freemasons.	1
	after such a long wait, i would have thought dan brown would have come up with something better, but it looks like he was maybe a 2-3 hit wonder.	1
	additionally, the protangonist of this story is just like the others of his earlier works.	1
	yes, there was some interesting information, but it really just cut at the surface and disappointed in the end.       	1
	a surprising disappointment....i only rated this above one star because of the original story line.	1
	the villain's character strains the bounds of credulity.	1
	sadly, this could have been quite suspenseful were it not for the constant repetitions of the same digressions.	1
	like brown's other novels, this could have been a thriller that would keep you on the edge of your chair.	1
	to me the book was at least 50+ pages too long due to the repetitions which i guess were there to drive home a certain philosophical/theological point of view.	1
	where were the editors on that one?	1
	the locales were believable and exist in real life, according to brown.	1
	he didn't discuss the facts v. fiction items like he has in past books though.	1
	finally, the ending was anti-climactic and just sort of drizzled off.	1
	i haven't gone into many details because i don't want to spoil it for others.	1
	i suggest you take the time to read the customer reviews before reading this book.	1
	i read the kindle version.	1
	the formatting on it was okay.      	1
	not very good.unfortunately, the new book by dan brown is a massive letdown.	1
	i don't have a problem if an author is sticking to a sucessful formula, but in 'the lost symbol' brown really only changes the setting of the plot and some minor details.	1
	the set of characters - good and evil - stays almost the same.	1
	the book's major problem is that brown is not very good at inventing a coherent story.	1
	the plot in 'symbol' is paper-thin, actually almost nothing really happens despite some uninteresting and seen-before running through washington (which unlike rome or paris in the previous books never really comes to life).	1
	characters act like they are stupid to no end - worst of all langdon, who after all he's seen in the last book still can't believe that they're after some big secret (almost as if he's read the final pages of the book himself) and always starts discussing this with the other characters, something that's boring the first time but happens endlessly throughout the book.	1
	also, the information dumping at times almost gets unbearable.	1
	even minor and uninteresting facts are explained in unnecessary detail and these lectures make the book very boring very fast.	1
	the biggest mistake brown makes - and one that every other writer would probably be asked to rewrite by his publisher - is the identity of the bad guy.	1
	this is a plot twist obvious beyond belief.	1
	i really don't get why no one said 'come on, every kid is going to notice from the beginning who this is!'...	1
	the book takes a few pages / chapters (that's almost the same with dan brown books) to start getting interesting, but for some hundred pages near the middle makes for a good page turner.	1
	the story does take a turn for the worse pretty fast after that though, and the ending is horrible and laughable at best.	1
	i really almost couldn't read the last 30 pages, they were so boring and stupid.	1
	that being said, the book is not the worst of all time.	1
	it has its weaknesses and is full of wasted chances, but manages to remain entertaining for most of the time.	1
	maybe if someone else had invented a good story and brown had only done research and some writing, this would certainly have been better.	1
	if you're a fan of brown, you may enjoy this book, altough to a much lesser extent than the previous one.	1
	but for most people it will be a big disappointment.      	1
	the worst dan brown....this book is not terrible.	1
	dan brown is not a horrible writer.	1
	however, this book does fall short of his previous novels.	1
	i was able to easy deduce who the villain was (i was secretly hoping for a surprise twist with the father at the end), some characters are introduced and then glanced over, some things are laid out but never analyzed, the plot lines don't harmonize at the end like the other books, and the ending is like....yea, so much for a secret.      	1
	remain extremely critical.the thriller is perfect and breathtaking, even if there are some weak points here and there, i mean the lack of professionalism on the side of the cia.	1
	as for that dan brown reveals some of the modern techniques the cia has been using for a while to torture people and at the same time shows how they can very easily overuse their powers and endanger the freedom of other people in the name of national security.	1
	it shows also how easy it is to make them panic.	1
	the book is doing exactly what the cia and the criminal use to frighten people into doing what they want.	1
	it reveals that some of the top us officers, ministers and representatives, without forgetting the supreme court justices and the senators, the generals and the police departments, fbi and cia, are members of the freemason movement in absolute secrecy.	1
	but then the fact that the book tries to show that these free masons are nothing but the direct descendants of the founding fathers and the framers of the usa is at least excessive, though it is funny to show the beautiful ideological art produced by that political movement to honor and deify - they use the word apotheosis (transformation into a god) in congress - george washington and some others.	1
	at the time that was pompous, but napoleon had done the same, but to show that as the acme of freedom and democracy is absurd and the great indifference of the people today about these 'masterpieces' of grandiloquent propaganda is plain sanity.	1
	the fact that dan brown builds the whole novel on the map of washington dc and the basic freemason symbols and representations that are embedded in  that town is also interesting but definitely excessive, the indifference of people about it today is plain sanity.	1
	dan brown though goes beyond and turns freemasonry into the full merging of all the various movements that have always existed in the world and that have questioned the ideological and existential dictatorship of one political organization across the millennia.	1
	i do not think that the rosicrucians, the zoroastrians, the vedic rsis, those he calls the original jews and christians, the freemasons, the illuminati and all the others he covers with ... are the same thing.	1
	but what's more his harping on the idea that we have to re-discover and go back to the knowledge of the origins of humanity is a plain absurdity that in a way kills the credibility of the novel.	1
	it is the basic myth of marx, the bible, and the quran, the belief in some kind of original primival paradise.	1
	marx called it original or primitive communism.	1
	absurd.	1
	man emerged through accidental mutations from animality and the selection of the best mutations by natural conditions enabled the human kind to develop little by little the brain we have, the languages we have, the intelligence we have, etc.	1
	our science being produced by our brains has to be in phase with them and our brains being produced by the surrounding world that selects the mutations have to be in phase with the world, hence our science has to be in phase with the world, but, and that is a big but, it does not reproduce the world: it explains the world by producing a model of that world, and a model is in no way a reproduction.	1
	the wheel, used to transport our bodies and goods, is nothing but a model of our legs since it produces the same effect: to transport us from one place to the next.	1
	dan brown ignores science and only accumulates things that he declares look alike, but comparing is not proving and historians like eisenman know that the meaning of history can only come from the differences between documents and not from the common points.	1
	yes we are living a transitional phase due to science and technology, due to communication and the economy of knowledge, but not because knowledge has a weight or a material density, but because knowledge is able, when used in exchange and cooperation among people to produce added value and hence to increase the value of our production, of our products, of our goods, hence the wealth of our society.	1
	dan brown is far from this knowledge economy since he defends the idea that some knowledge has to be kept as mysteries, that is to say something only those who have been initiated can know.	1
	that is what is totally unacceptable in the freemason movement, apart from the fact it is a secret society that hides a lot of its inner functioning and members, the fact that it is believing in an elite, in the necessity to entrust the government of the world to an initiated elite.	1
	and of course dan brown makes some basic mistakes, like telling us there have only been twelve zodiac signs.	1
	wrong.	1
	there have been thirteen zodiac signs up to the twelfth or thirteenth centuries in our society (the 11th century thirteenth sign has been put back up on the outside wall of the abbey church of issoire (france) a few years ago.	1
	the thirteenth sign is the serpent bearer, the ancestor of pour caduceis, of medicine, the healer, the bronze serpent of moses.	1
	it's a shame such approximate facts and mistakes are used to support the forty page final lecture which is absolutely useless in the plot and absurd in content.	1
	by the way buddha did not believe in god.	1
	dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university paris 12 crteil, cegid	1
	and then, i came to the end....i would probably have given this messy page-turner three stars.	1
	but then, i had to hack my way through the endless babbling that followed the grand climax.	1
	sweet suffering moses!	1
	is dan brown being paid by the word.	1
	it goes on and on, and then on somemore.	1
	it's pedantic and pretentious -- and a major buzzkill.	1
	it made me really miss the villain -- he was fun to have around, and he knew how to get his point across quickly and efficiently.	1
	by the time i hit the final page, i was ready to give the book one star.	1
	but i had enjoyed the climactic moments enough, that i decided to be generous.	1
	which is more than can be said for dan brown -- who's desperately in need of an editor who know how to wield a red pencil...      	1
	honerd the contract.ok i was very exciting about this book and i purchased the day it was released.	1
	i know there are lots of die hard db fans out there but to me this book is just not right.	1
	this book feels like as if it was written by one of those dan brown wannabe authors.	1
	after i had read ls i can't help but to think 'db just had to honer his contract with his publisher'.	1
	lost symbol is not a bad book but not a good one neither.	1
	personally i was expecting a better book from db.	1
	i'm sure there is a great work behind this book but it is not good enough for save this book.         	1
	disappointing.i agree with many other readers that this book was a major disappointment.	1
	while brown's plots were never meant to be entirely realistic, this one seems over the top.	1
	as usual in his books, the fleshing out of the characters just isn't there.	1
	what kind of a guy is robert langdon?	1
	we know what he does for a living but little about him as a person.	1
	but much of the book was just plain boring - too much time spent on technical details of noetics, etc.	1
	i did enjoy learning more about the masons and he did cause me to read up on them online.	1
	but the 'explanation' of the lost word was just plain silly and not believable.	1
	and his pontificating on the nature of man, religion and the meaning of it all was an exercise in personal indulgence.      	1
	good, cookie-cutter thriller.`the lost symbol' is dan brown's long-awaited follow-up to `the davinci code', and like `the davinci code' and its predecessor `angels & demons', `the lost symbol' is immersed in symbology, lavish art in a beautiful city, a secret society, an improbable bad guy, and a thrilling chase.	1
	brown definitely has a winning formula, and he sticks closely to it again, replacing rome, paris, and london with washington dc; the illuminati and knights templar with the masons; and a lunatic priest and lunatic albino with a tattooed lunatic.	1
	the hero, robert langdon, is again summoned to help out a friend and is in for more than he had bargained for, finding himself in a life-or death quest to fix an immediate problem by solving ancient secrets and riddles.	1
	to contrast `symbol' a little with its predecessors, there is less action here than in the others.	1
	from a pure thrills perspective, `symbols' is the inferior to both.	1
	thematically, this book is superior to `the davinci code': if `code' had a theme, it was overshadowed by the mary magdalene issue.	1
	`symbol' is inferior however to `angels & demons', which effectively incorporated its theme of science versus faith into the plot.	1
	the themes of `symbol' are interesting.	1
	the theological ideas of finding the true nature of god inside each of us and using our minds to change the world for the better are timely, and i think, as does brown if the last word of the novel reflects his beliefs, hopeful.	1
	the scientific sub-theme of noetics was also fascinating.	1
	i would have liked all of this better incorporated into the plot though.	1
	brown still hasn't learned to write.	1
	in fact, his writing seems to have gotten worse.	1
	a rambling 50-page denouement and constant melodramatic peeks into the characters' thoughts (dear god..., is this really the end?)	1
	needlessly clutter the prose.	1
	50-75 pages could have cut to make this a tighter and better book.	1
	it's sad to think one of the most famous and best-selling authors in the world really can't write all that well.	1
	but the guy can tell a story.	1
	he knows how to write a thriller.	1
	he writes about the most fascinating subjects.	1
	he's developed a great hero in langdon, likable, smart, and mostly human.	1
	and how he comes up with those codes is pure genius.	1
	brown fans will buy this book and like it.	1
	for those interested in reading brown for the first time, i recommend starting with `angels' and working up chronologically.	1
	for intellectual high-brows or artistic snobs, look elsewhere.	1
	but they probably already knew that.                             	1
	wanting to believe the bad reviews weren't justified....well... they are and they aren't.	1
	first, a few minor points that should be obvious.	1
	-the dvc and a+d are two really tough acts to follow, i am not surprised db is incapable of hitting a home run each time... and who is?	1
	-i see a lot about the book being just like the others he's written in the past (if you've one read dan brown novel you've read them all), which in large part, it is.. but be fair here, it didn't stop john grisham or j.k. rowling from writing the same novel 7 different times... i have been silently praying for those 2 to stop writing books for years.	1
	the good: -give brown credit, he obviously put some effort and homework into researching the topics, which i hope is something you really appreciate like i do, or you shouldn't be wasting your time with his works.	1
	-it definitely had some of those page-turner qualities of his old books that made you incapable of putting it down or racing home from work to read it.	1
	-personally, though he is being accused of not being the greatest writer over it, i like the fact that his books make for fairly light reading.	1
	i don't think he's an awful writer like many people seem to, i rather enjoy his literary style for the most part.	1
	the bad: -like all of his books, it's simply too long.	1
	he is given to repetitive rants, particularly when in the mind of his villains, way past the point of absorption by reader.	1
	-he thoroughly abused his cliff hanger chapter endings.	1
	it got really old and started to feel gimmicky and like the book was simply skipping around too much.	1
	-the same 'sub plots' are played over and over again.	1
	the one that keeps coming to mind now is how many times they couldn't solve a puzzle, and then all of the sudden it was simple, how could have they not have seen it before??	1
	lame.	1
	-it's hard for any book to recover from a bad ending, and this book had not one, but two bad endings.	1
	the first bad ending was that the secret they were trying to protect throughout the book just wasn't all that exciting or all that worthy of protection.	1
	i suspect that this was the most disappointing part for most readers.	1
	the second bad ending was the 50 plus pages near the end of the book, that i stopped caring about long after the meat of the book came to it's conclusion.	1
	it was just drivel and pseudo-spiritual nonsense.	1
	his editor really needs to reign him in on spiritual rantings he so loves, because it made the ending to this book one of the most insufferable i have ever read.	1
	in the end, i have to admit, i found the majority of the book to be fairly entertaining despite the fact that it did have a bad ending and wasn't that original.	1
	i really got the feeling that dan brown was already imagining the movie (that will no doubt follow) in his head, and unfortunately, it read and felt a bit like a cheesy, cliche hollywood movie.	1
	i think that we probably need to accept that the little love affair with dan brown has run it's course.	1
	much like the musician who has only good album or the athlete who has only one or two good seasons, i fear that dan has played his hand well, had his day in the sun and his best stories are now behind us.	1
	he managed to make himself into a household name, but by the time he finishes his next novel (especially if he takes 6 years), he may well find himself irrelevant.       	1
	get it from the library.this is definitely not his best book.	1
	preachy and lacking in adventure.	1
	gone is his riveting storytelling.	1
	don't buy it.	1
	wait till it gets to your local library.      	1
	laughable.laughable is the best word to describe brown's long awaited, but deeply disappointing novel.	1
	while i enjoyed learning about all the secrets and little known facts about washington d.c., it seems he just threw them all into a fish bowl, pulled them out one by one and then tried to link them into the same old story line that he used in his other robert langdon books.	1
	predictable, poor character development (or perhaps more like no character development), and downright boring in places!	1
	and for a guy with eidetic memory, langdon sure forgot a lot of important things.	1
	i can't see even tom hanks making this role work in the movie version.	1
	and what i thought was the most fascinating concept, the noetic science, was nothing more than a before-thought and and after-thought.	1
	dan brown is laughing all the way to the bank with this one.	1
	he has joined that ever-growing club of authors (patricia cornwell, james patterson, etc.)	1
	who start out with promise, but then get lazy and rely on previous fame and a tired-out formula for the sole purpose of making more money.        	1
	i agree with most...this is not dvc or a&d;.while i devotedly read on hour after hour, i did not feel the tension that kept me up much of the night i read da vinci code.	1
	likewise, there was not an interesting character relationship like in angels and demons.	1
	in the end, lost symbol was a fun, but bland read that will be forgotten quickly in years to come.      	1
	meh.....this book is average at best.	1
	i am a big dan brown fan but the book seems rushed, like he was trying to finish it to fast and didn't put as much research/facts into as his others.	1
	if your a fan then check it out.	1
	if not ehh check it out from the library....      	1
	dissapointing.i like all the previous brown's novels and i like a lot the davinci code.	1
	the lost symbol was very dissapointing.	1
	the references to the masons were not sharp and it seems that langdon spend all book trying to be sure masons are not upset for the content of the book.	1
	maybe brown doesn't want the same level of controversy that he got from the opus dhei with the davinci code.	1
	anyway, the plot is flat and there is a lot of deja vu, the movie national treasure about thte same topic was more entertaining (and it's not a very good film).	1
	i'm happy ot get the kindle version of $9, i'll be mad if i would spend $20 on this.      	1
	the lost symbol.interesting references but way too preachy.	1
	brown assumes readers incapable of gleaning their own insights.	1
	he's compelled to answer the questions he raises rather gifting us the journey he creates.	1
	brown needs an 'illuminating' editor to help him discover how to satisfyingly end a book.	1
	i have learned alot from brown, which is why i eagerly anticipated this book.	1
	i'm hungry for him to become a 'master' himself.      	1
	a bit disappointing.....when i heard that dan brown's latest book would revolve around the secrets of the masons, i was mildly disappointed.	1
	with the release of the movie, 'national treasure', i was afraid there would be too many similarities that would dampen the excitement of the storyline.	1
	however, once i started reading the lost symbol, i realized that my disappointment didn't lie within the story of the masons.	1
	it was solely due to the storyline's structure.	1
	it felt like a retread of the da vinci code, with bits and pieces of angels & demons peppered throughout.	1
	granted, most writers follow a standard construction that allows the reader to develop and maintain a connection with the main character that stretches from book to book (in this case, harvard symbologist robert langdon).	1
	yet dan brown's latest effort seemed too familiar - as if he was afraid to stray from previous outlines.	1
	on the bright side, i love the interlacing of fact and fiction when it comes to historical art and architecture.	1
	dan brown delivers once again - this time enlightening readers of the magnificent buildings that grace our nation's capital.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised to see a boost in tourism in washington d.c. due to his brilliant descriptions and mystical overtones.	1
	if only the storyline was as good as the imagery.	1
	maybe dan brown's motto was, 'you can't have too much of a good thing'.	1
	but in this case, i think you can. 	1
	it's ok.it was an ok book.	1
	it was a little too similar to his previous books.	1
	a mystery and running from govt officials and the bad guys but solving a puzzle.      	1
	goes down hill fast.not as good as angels & demons (my fave of his books).	1
	not as good as da vinci code.	1
	it is full of interesting facts and connections across science, philosphy, art and religion of which i was not aware.	1
	i was reading quickly and turning those pages swiftly at the beginning but the find a clue, figure it out, run and hide from the baddies, rinse then repeat sequence got old after a while.	1
	the weakest part of the book for me was the 'international crisis' once it was revealed.	1
	i think i'll reread angels & demons.	1
	p.s.	1
	readers of a previous dan brown novel must check our rosslyn chapel if in/near edinburgh, scotland.	1
	very worth it in its own right but with added interest and notoriety due to the book, which i won't name.      	1
	predictable, disappointing and far fetched.wow, this book really mad me angry.	1
	not at the villan but at the author.	1
	dan brown's work has really gone downhill.	1
	there are so many unbelievable parts to the story and the last 1/3 of the book just went on and on.	1
	i could hardly wait for it to end.	1
	the whole part about langdon in the deprivation chamber is...how do i say this, terrible......rotten.....stupid.	1
	save your money and borrow it from a friend.      	1
	more of the same.	1
	i was very excited for this book - even ordered it for my mother so we could read it together... i was very dissapointed overall.	1
	the book was entertaining on the surface ... and that is about all i have good to say about it.	1
	the previous langdon novels were great - this one fell short.	1
	overall it was more of the same + some national treasure ... if you have read the previous langdon books, stick to them.	1
	if you are picking this book up as your first dan brown book then you may find it new and page turning.	1
	overall - eh.       	1
	formulaic, but fun.it does not take very many pages of 'the lost symbol' to realize you have experienced this plot before.	1
	much of it is like 'the da vinci code,' with some 'national treasure' included.	1
	robert langdon seems to be unable toescape from the 'groundhog day' nature of his life.	1
	he keeps doing the same things, with a few new faces, and a different location.	1
	this book deals with the masons, and their secrets.	1
	langdon, of course, is wise and intelligent.	1
	he understands thateveryone is a bit odd, and if you get in the other fellow's shoes, you can understand what he holds sacred.	1
	not a bad philosophy, really, if its applied wisely.	1
	you have to give dan brown credit for tolerance.	1
	the first half of the book is best.	1
	the plot holds together fairly well until the last half of the book.	1
	then, it spins out of control, and becomes much less enjoyable.	1
	still, it held me, and made me want to see how it would end.	1
	i always marvel at the incredible energy of dan brown's characters.	1
	their adventures take place in a very short period of time.	1
	they suffer terror, hot pursuits, and the constant need to elude villains and the law.	1
	while doing this, they do not, apparently, need to go to the bathroom, eat, or fall asleep.	1
	i got a chuckle at the end when one of the characters---peter solomon----who has had his hand cut off, and has been at death's door, suddenly finds the energy to drive langdon around washington d.c. in an suv.it is an amazing example of healing.	1
	and i must add one more thing.	1
	once again, langdon is the king of platonic relationships.	1
	the girl is his, or could be, but he lets her go.	1
	one cannot help but wish that when it is all over, langdon would do something with the girl.	1
	hey, after what he has been through, he, and the reader, deserve it.	1
	the villain is a truly awful fellow, and his identity is hidden until the end of the novel.	1
	his reptilian nature, andcreepy ways are quite engaging.	1
	he is a guy you love to hate, and you would be horrified to meet him.	1
	its not a great book, but it is readable diversion.	1
	i had fun with it, and it kept me wanting to learn how it would end.	1
	you can do worse than that.       	1
	a simple ok will have to do..exactly what you would expect from brown: lots of interesting etymology, double-entrendres and word substitution grids in the plot, along with some wonderful kernels of interesting history, and cool little objects that are key to the story.	1
	the evil guy is truly twisted, and you get learn a lot more about historical tidbits of washington dc.	1
	but unfortunately, the plot twists were also downright brownesque.	1
	i caught every one of them about five pages before they were revealed.	1
	i'm not sure that's all bad, but the only thing i did not guess was the ending.	1
	i guess there was one, sort of.	1
	my wife happened to come home from a trip just as i was finishing the book, on my kindle (which is difficult to guage exactly where you are in a book).	1
	i told her that i had to just finish the last page,and i would be with her, little knowing that there were another forty pages or so, which really is just padding.	1
	after reading that the lost 'symbol' in question was 'real' in about 85 different statements in the book, imagine my surprise when it was really metaphorical after all, at least in my judgment.	1
	same ending as 'the celestine prophecy.	1
	'(movie version) disappointing, but i enjoyed the book's history and detail.	1
	there were two annoying things about the book.	1
	1) repeated identical phrases/terms which could have easily been re-worded and caught by word check, and 2) langdon clings sooooo annoyingly to his lack of faith.	1
	'i can't believe, i can't believe,' over and over and over until i just wanted to slap him.	1
	he is surrounded by people who do believe and he is threated by a maniac who does believe.	1
	anybody as smart as professor langdon would stop crying like a baby about it and get on point: catching the villain.	1
	the best part of the book was including the noetics angle, which i enjoyed because i am a great fan of mctaggart's work, if not her ego.	1
	she'll sell another million reprints, no doubt.	1
	it's fascinating stuff, and brown does us a favor by bringing it to our collective attention.   	1
	this is the best dan brown could come up with?.i've read most of dan brown's novels but i don't consider myself a big fan.	1
	he is a pretty good story-teller though his novels are a bit contrived.	1
	this was his worst effort by far in my opinion.	1
	i figured out the secret location everyone was frantically searching for pretty much at the beginning of the book, the first time the phrase 'a staircase under a rock' was mentioned.	1
	then i had to read hundreds more pages before i could say, 'see, i told you so'.	1
	the great secret that could rock the order of the world, and the masons vehemently protected, willing even to die or sacrifice their brothers was more than a let down:  it was a rip-off.	1
	dan brown insults every reader's intelligence by not delivering after such a huge buildup.	1
	ernest hemingway once used bullfighting as a metaphor for writing.	1
	he noted that some matadors dramatically roll their capes, accentuating their movements, though never getting close to the bull.	1
	the good matadors don't need to exaggerate their movements.	1
	in this novel, dan brown is waving his cape all over the place though no bull is ever dangerously close to him (unless we count b.s.).	1
	the characters in this book constantly have their jaws drop open in utter amazement over the most banal revelations.	1
	there are 'unbelievable secrets' that hardly raise the reader's eyebrow, and historical and religious references that just prove annoying after a little while.	1
	to worsen matters, the writing becomes tiresome at times.	1
	i don't know how many times brown uses the adjective, 'expansive'.	1
	there are expansive lawns, expansive roofs, expansive parking lots.....pick another damn adjective already!	1
	the worst part is the incredible enthusiasm with which brown embraces all kinds of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, from astral projection to remote viewing; from near-death experiences to weighing a person's soul at the moment of death.	1
	it's as if he read the book, 'the secret' and actually believes that crap.	1
	which makes me wonder, is dan brown related to sylvia brown?      	1
	not a bad sequel.dan brown has once again graced our presence with robert langdon, symbologist extraordinaire.	1
	having read the davinci code 5 times, i am familiar with the writings of brown, and my perceived personality of langdon.	1
	first off, as always brown's research is compelling, and will open the door to many who do not know of certain books, sciences, and locales.	1
	in this regard, i love brown's ability to pull all of this together.	1
	though i would prefer it in non-fiction form.	1
	the plot was so-so, i found the descriptions of the characters other than langdon, weak at best.	1
	the history behind the characters is almost non-existent.	1
	in parts the plot was cheesy, and the story wrapped around the history and the non-fiction is not all that great.	1
	all in all, a decent read, but i find the sigma force novels by james rollins, better written, the characters more interesting, with just as much science and history.       	1
	not as great as his other books.i was really excited to dan browns latest book, however my excitement turned to frustration and boredom... if i wanted to read a scientific journal i would go out an buy science books... there is so much scientific dribble dedicated in this book that i feel many average science readers will have no idea what they hell is going on ... so that was one major flaw in it.	1
	it was like i had to take study notes and research what the hell he was writing about many times throughout the book.	1
	another frustrating thing about the book is that in his previous works i felt i was learning history and it was entertaining, this time around very little is spent on educating the reader about the topics at hand .... personally i think the topic of masons is a boring one and brown made a big mistake of picking this as his focus point in his tale.	1
	personally a lot of times i felt there was similarities between this and the motion picture national treasure, and to say the least national treasure was way more entertaining than this, plus with a more enjoyable and satisfying conclusion...  better try next time mr brown..      	1
	boring.few would argue that dan brown is a good writer.	1
	his prose rarely rises above high school level, and he never met a cliche he didn't love.	1
	he constantly inflicts long information dumps on the reader, either through narrative exposition or dialogue.	1
	and his dialogue is laughable; just try reading it aloud--no one ever has or ever will talk like that.	1
	his characters, especially langdon, hardly ever rise to the two-dimensional level.	1
	finally, he writes the same novel over and over: langdon and a female companion are racing through a big city attempting to forestall some terrible disaster and doing battle with a weird adversary.	1
	still, despite all that, he does manage to create page turners: angels and demons and the da vinci code were hard to put down.	1
	but not the lost symbol.	1
	i found myself slogging through this book, wanting it to end, counting how many pages i still had to go.	1
	i found nothing remotely interesting about the plot or the characters.	1
	and boy was the climax a disappointment.	1
	i won't give it away, but the thing that the cia was desperately trying to prevent happening would not have been a big deal at all if it had happened.	1
	everyone could have spared themselves the trouble.	1
	i can forgive brown's poor writing if he keeps me entertained, as he did in his other books.	1
	but i cannot forgive him for boring me to tears.      	1
	sorry, but  this is a let down.the da vinci code was great fun, this one is a let down.	1
	don't get me wrong, it would be almost impossible to repeat all the fun of the da vinci code, i know.	1
	but the lost symbol is 100 pages too long, it propels to some speed only because of extensive usage of cliff hangers, teasing the reader by simply not saying right away what is going on, (in a manner of 'can it be that?	1
	'), delaying the descriptions and answers where is a situation with lots of tension.	1
	i know, this is a staple in thriller writing, manipulating reader's response, prolonging suspense during some moments in order to create even more suspense, but here it was really over the top.	1
	this trick works well in books which are really exciting.	1
	however, this one was not, and cliff hangers or prolonging suspense couldn't fix the problem of boredom.some parts were bordering on silly: like for example there should be real rush to find peter solomon, who after having having his hand severed was probably bleeding horribly,  and was probably nearing death.	1
	but langdon of course had time to contemplate his knowledge and deliver some lectures.	1
	no real ticking-time-bomb effect here, and it should be.	1
	also the appearances of tatooed bad guy, who hiding under a wig and under makeup was very recognizable to the reader were creating an aura of some kind of a fairy tale we readers were supposed to participate, willingly, suspending a lot of our disbelief.	1
	because the book is very much driven by a rather rigid formula,(after six years of writing i would expect something better), the masons didn't really capture my curiosity, add to it the overuse of thriller writing tricks, plus lecturing where should be more plot(as things were happening during the short time of 12 hours only, and there was not enough sense of urgency for such short time),this book simply started to be really boring.	1
	it had kind of a slow start anyway, first 100 pages or so were not too exciting.in addition as mentioned above, i needed to suspend too much of my disbelief.	1
	i can suspend my disbelief in thrillers, without feeling childish.	1
	but only when things move fast and are plausible to some extend.	1
	i was not able to engage enough in this book, and to stay long enough with this book to read the ending, as i lost my interest, and didn't regain it.	1
	maybe one day i will decide to read the ending, but at the moment i don't care.in my opinion this book doesn't live up to the hype.        	1
	a great read.another great read by dan brown.	1
	lost symbol has a well developed plot with strong character development.	1
	brown's books have always been able to grab me and pull me into the plot.	1
	lost symbol was a gift to me, but before i began reading it i ordered it for my kindle---much easier to handle and carry around than the hard bound copy!	1
	i am looking forward to the next dan brown book!      	1
	a little dissapointed..i purchased this for my wife she was dissapointed with this book.	1
	she liked dan's other novels but not this one.      	1
	lost symol is awesome!.i really enjoyed this book i bought it for my dad and father in law for christmas.	1
	excellent book and excellent author.      	1
	boomm!!	1
	you will be biting your nails..fast foward, bones shaking, thrilling, you wouldn't want to even eat until you finish.	1
	once you start reading it you don't whant to stop!!	1
	take my word for it.	1
	i tell you as a :.	1
	i am!	1
	hehehe!      	1
	a fun read.a little hard to beleive at times but a fun read.	1
	just don't take it seriously!      	1
	the lost symbol.i love dan brown, but i just could not get into the lost symbol.	1
	it had a good plot, but was not as quick as angels & demons and the da vinci code.maybe if i were better in science class i would have enjoyed it more.	1
	i am still a die hard brown fan, and most certainly will continue to read his books.      	1
	story as expected..i was in 2 minds about this book.	1
	i thought it came out too fast after the others, so i did have lower expectations.	1
	but it delivered the story, and did carry me along so i did not put it down until done.	1
	it did seem lengthy and repetitive at times.	1
	i almost felt i needed to know washington, so in some ways the detailed directions were a hindrance as i did not know the places mentioned in relation to each other, but i felt the way he kept detailing the geography was for our benefit.	1
	my purpose in reading novels is to be taken somewhere else and not to worry too much about the literature of it all, although it is a bonus if that is good too.	1
	this was meant to be an exciting read and that's about it.      	1
	a furious pace and promising story which falls flat in it's finale..being a huge dan brown fan, i couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.	1
	the story follows prof. robert langdon who once again finds himself entwined in a deadly game of solving ancient puzzles and riddles in order to stop a madman and protect as well as reveal a powerful and mystic secret.	1
	much of the lost symbol focuses on freemasonry and ancient mysticism and anyone interested in either of those things, or in early american history will enjoy the attention to detail and thorough research that was obviously undertaken.	1
	once past the first fifty or so pages, the pace of the read becomes exhausting.	1
	brown does a great job keeping you turning pages by dangling a carrot in front of you at the end of each short chapter.	1
	the biggest issue i had with the book is that it creates a lot of promise and anticipation, but never really follows through.	1
	i felt like the last 20-30 pages of the book really fell flat.	1
	it was a bit of a disappointment.	1
	i did enjoy reading this book and continue to be a dan brown fan.	1
	i just hope the next book doesn't build up a lot of anticipation that it can't deliver on.      	1
	freemasons, conspiracies and little more.taking certain historical facts to illogical extremes, dan brown's newest 'thriller' focuses on the influence of freemasons in american history.	1
	professor robert langdon is summoned by his friend peter solomon, the overseer of the smithsonian,to come to speak in washington.	1
	solomon, however, is kidnapped setting off a frantic search by langdon for his friend.	1
	throughout the search, brown dwells on masonic history, ritual and mysteries.	1
	for some reason langdon is not the only one searching for solomon.	1
	the kidnapping of the culture vulture has somehow triggered a national security investigation by the cia led personally by a diminutive senior official.	1
	other than for a few conspiracy theorists, it may be difficult for most to believe any secrets of the masons could, if disclosed, threaten the security of america.	1
	this does not deter brown who writes endless, formulaic and  breathless chase scenes,  punctuated by ruminations on theological, scientific (the quasi-science of 'noetics'), and paranormal topics.	1
	as for the supposed actual national security issues, if this is what the cia is protecting, we need a new cia.	1
	'nuff said.      	1
	good for what it is.my biggest complaint with dan brown's novels is that they are all incredibly formulaic.	1
	i literally think brown uses the same outline for all of his books and just drops in different characters, cities, and mysterious codes.	1
	'the lost symbol' is no exception.	1
	this time, harvard professor and renowned symbolygist robert langdon is summoned to washington, d.c., at the request of an old friend.	1
	however, another force is at work behind the scenes, and robert soon finds himself at the center of yet another mystery that may result in the revelation of information that will change the world.	1
	despite his lack of plot originality, brown's novels are all incredibly entertaining and intriguing, and 'the lost symbol' is no exception.	1
	this was a very enjoyable book to read, although i figured out much of the ending in advance just by recalling different elements of brown's previous books.	1
	i was impressed by the twist the book seemed to take with about 100 or so pages to go, but then the author took the easy way out, losing a bit of my respect.	1
	still, i may be critical, but i'm also a fan of these books because they're suspenseful and a lot of fun to read.	1
	fans of 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code' will not be disappointed.      	1
	not up to par with his other books.a disappointment compared to dan brown's other two books about robert langdon.	1
	this book was slow, boring and predictable.	1
	the basic story line was good, but the way it was carried out ruined it.	1
	not enough action or suspense.	1
	i could see all the 'surprises' coming.	1
	in his other two books about robert langdon dan brown did an excellent job of keeping the suspense up and surprising me.	1
	not so this time.	1
	i wouldn't say that there was a lot of foreshadowing, but it was just too easy to guess.	1
	the ending was completely anti-climatic.	1
	i just wanted to get through it as a fast as possible and be done with it.        	1
	200 pages too long....i really love dan brown, i love robert langdon and the whole concept.	1
	this has been my most eagerly awaited book ever and unfortunately it has also been the biggest let down.	1
	yes, it was basically the da vinci code set in washington dc, but i was ok with that.	1
	i was ok with it being almost the same plot, basically the same leading lady, same tweed jacket.	1
	what i wasn't ok with was the extra 150 pages of added fluff in the middle of the book and the extra 50 pages at the end.	1
	the story seemingly ends and wraps up and for some reason the main characters continue on like nothing ever happened.	1
	i am being very careful not to give anything away here, but just know, you can basically skip 50% of this book and still get a very good picture of what happened.	1
	not that i did, i slogged through all 500 pages until i got to the end and then, just like the last lord of the rings, it continued and when it did finally end i was left feeling like i got cheated.	1
	he should have ended it on page 450, not 500.  i'm still a fan and i'll still race to buy the next langdon book.	1
	but i hope he has learned a lesson with the lost symbol.	1
	i am not the only one feeling this way.       	1
	solid but not great.dan brown must be a bit mystified if he reads through the reviews on amazon.com.	1
	in many ways 'the lost symbol' is a superior book to 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code'.	1
	brown has matured as a writer and has honed his craft.	1
	mainly there is less author intrusion .	1
	i.e.	1
	poor dialogue or scenes that case the reader to break from the spell that has been cast by the author and think 'what?	1
	that seems silly/corny/gimicky/stupid' - in short, it knocks the reader back to the reality that they are reading a book.	1
	'the lost symbol' has fewer such 'author intrusions' than brown's previous novels.	1
	why the bad reviews?	1
	i guess there are lots of reasons, but top on the list is that his last two books were quite shocking.	1
	without giving too much away 'the lost symbol' is just not as shocking.	1
	it offers many of the same ingredients but the pie just isn't as filling.	1
	the story focuses on masonic tradition and the geography of washington d.c. robert langdon has been asked to give a keynote speech on the symbolism of dc only to find that he is being pulled into a plot by a madman.	1
	sound familiar?	1
	langdon unlocks clues that have been entrusted to him by his friend in order to save his life.	1
	other observations- the last 30 pages are pretty anti-climatic- i agree with the person who said that dan brown should consider a new editor- this story was bloated by about 50 pages - which served as a distraction.- nice plot twists - dan brown broke from his formula (see my other dan brown reviews) and found a new way of introducing plot twists.- as always, dan brown introduces to a series of arcane facts about geography, history, word orgins and such - 'the lost symbol' is an interesting read strictly based on brown's explanations.- i really don't see 'the lost symbol' being made into a movie - it just doesn't seem to flow well for a movie.	1
	final verdict- 90% of 'the lost symbol' is the best book written by dan brown, however i think a majority of brown fans will disagree.	1
	4 stars      	1
	drawn out with anticlimactic ending.where to begin?	1
	started off strong, a page turner, i was interested, i cared.	1
	after about midway through i was literally bogged down by the book.	1
	get to the meat already!!	1
	could have been shorter and the ending was a bit of a let down.	1
	glad i got this from the library.	1
	waited a month or so on the  wait list, but happy i did not buy it.       	1
	revelation.there's an exciting and entertaining two hundred page book buried inside the 528 pages of dan brown's latest robert langdon thriller titled, the lost symbol.	1
	for readers who find value in pages per dollar, there's some benefit here in having more pages to turn, which might prolong a reader's pleasure.	1
	for me, the surplus pages riff with exposition that adds little to the novel.	1
	unlike his earlier best sellers which drew heavy criticism from the catholic church and increased sales, the lost symbol is unlikely to irritate the institutions that brown describes.	1
	in this case, masonic ceremonies, symbols and buildings are likely to increase the range of washington, d.c. tourism rather than lead to ire.	1
	the entire novel is the revelation to langdon of a buried symbol long kept secret in washington.	1
	along the way, the adventure, suspense and plot twists can be entertaining, provided a reader has the patience to put up with superfluous exposition while awaiting the return of action.	1
	rating: three-star (recommended)	1
	rated pg-13 - only weighing in on the language, sex, and violence.this book has already been thoroughly reviewed.	1
	i'm only weighing in on the language, sex, and violence.	1
	foul language - some of the foulest in a low to moderate amount.	1
	it didn't move me to stop reading the book.sex - a few references to having had sex.	1
	some references to a huge 'sex organ'.	1
	no sex scenes.	1
	nothing graphic.violence - about the amount you would expect in a pg-13 movie thriller.	1
	a severed hand.	1
	multiple violent murders.	1
	blowing up buildings.	1
	gun shooting.	1
	a torture chamber and torture scenes.	1
	it's not dwelt on or explicitly described, but there's lots of violence.	1
	i did read the entire book and i found it to be an entertaining read, nothing more, nothing less.       	1
	not really quite a 4-star.dan brown is an author i will always pick up since i find his novels very entertaining.	1
	this is the fifth one i have read and i liked this one better than 'deception point' and 'digital fortress' but less than 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons' (my favorite).	1
	this one was very similar and style and tone to both davinci and a&d;, but seemed to be a bit more formulaic and a re-do of those novels just set in a different location.	1
	the three main things that bothered me about this novel:  1) the main character of robert langdon reappears to take center stage again but seems to be more dense and, at times, just oblivious and constantly in need of help from other sources.	1
	2)  as i was reading, i began to grow weary of the characters looking at something that the reader isn't privy to, being amazed and enlightened by it, and then the next chapter starts without the reader knowing what had been revealed.	1
	while it can heighten the suspense, after multiple usages of the device, i just was annoyed and impatient.	1
	3)  three characters go through incredible physical trauma but within hours manage to flit around washington with a huge amount of stamina and no after-effects.	1
	it stretches the reader's ability to believe that people can be near death and a couple of hours later are able to fully function and are just 'tired'.	1
	even with the negatives of this novel, i still found it enjoyable.	1
	my personal take is that if this weren't a dan brown book and if it didn't have all the hype associated with it, people would find it entertaining and a good read.	1
	it's just not a novel that can stand up to all the expectations - not an 'it' book in my opinion but a fun one anyway.	1
	no, it's not the davinci code, but it's very good....i'm not sure how people can not like this book.	1
	total page turner, fast paced, several stories going at once... ok, 'yes' there is definitely a pattern to his books and 'no' it's not the 'big reveal' of the davinci code, but how many times can you make that reveal... once.	1
	i enjoyed the lost symbol and finished it in a little under 3 days.	1
	i'd like to see dan brown's next book be on scientology, but i know 'they' would never let that happen.      	1
	good effort.the book was a good effort - but came off as being more contrived by making masonic ties as hypersensitive.	1
	perhaps the bar was set too high with his previous books.	1
	still enjoyed the weaving of history with the story line.        	1
	ehh..well, it was just ok. after such a long wait with all the hype of  i was hoping for more.	1
	the baddie is creepy, the subject matter is promising(there is a great mason mystery out there to write), but the mystery is weak, and the last tenth of the book brown seemingly tries to reach for gravitas which is just not there.	1
	i'd probably skip this one.	1
	if you like his style read one of his earlier books like  or .	1
	neither are fine literature, but they are better than this.        	1
	so anticlimatic.great, exciting book for the first 95%.	1
	then what let down beginning with the death of the villian.       	1
	fill in the blanks?.spoiler alert!	1
	dan brown must use a plot generator that goes something like this: - start with robert langdon, renowned symbologist who, despite being thrown into multiple international secrets, scandals and run-ins with assassins, is permanently perplexed (in an attempt at humility) as to why anyone wants his help with, you know, his life's passion.- add one secret society, ancient or otherwise, and the secret 'only they hold'.	1
	- place in an appropriate city which coincidentally has a high percentage of landmarks pertaining to this secret society.- add a member/someone aware of this secret society who is killed/maimed/kidnapped.	1
	helps if he knows or has met langdon in the past (thereby preventing them from calling some other world renowned symbologist for help in the investigation).- add a mysterious, intelligent, single woman who has some relation to the aforementioned killed/maimed/kidnapped secret society member and who langdon constantly uses as an intellectual crutch when he can't put the pieces together.	1
	obligitory romance may ensue.- one dash of a high-ranking police/security official who will be under suspicion of being 'the bad guy/the traitor' for 2/3 of the novel before being redeemed when it's revealed they were just doing their job the entire time.- a peppering of an elderly, sage helper who either reaches out to langdon, or whom langdon knew all along, to fill in those pesky blanks he couldn't figure out.- for flavor, make sure your villian is so ridiculously, melodramatically diabolical that only the darkest heart could sympathize.	1
	he should also be mysterious, a near-perfect physical specimen, highly trained in not only firearms but hand-to-hand combat, and comfortable with riddles and over-complicated revenge tactics.	1
	and of course, he has a life-long blood feud against the secret society in question, whether or not they currently exist.- insert secret traitor here.- bake with a race-against-time urgency of no more than twelve hours.- be sure to cool the anger of whichever secret group you pissed off by copping out at the end and revealing the assassin's hatred was misplaced under a black-and-white worldview because of some past emotional pain, and assure your reader that yes, this secret group does have positive aspects to it and was never really a threat in the first place.- don't forget to reveal your big ultra secret secret, no matter how stupid of a secret it may be, thereby making you wonder how this secret was ever kept for thousands of years, since everyone seems to be jumping at the chance to tell langdon what it is.- happily ever after.	1
	bottom line: the lost symbol was a classic, albiet uninspired, dan brown novel, and i'm sad to say that is no longer a 'good thing'.	1
	when compared to the much more earth-shaking consequences of angels and demons and the da vinci code, 'symbol''s big twist falls flat on its face.	1
	a video of self-proclaimed masons performing their rights?	1
	that's supposed to compete with the vatican, all its knowledge, art, treasures and god knows how many people being blown to smithereens?	1
	hmmmm.	1
	tough to decide just which is more horrifying.	1
	angels and demons was by far his best novel.	1
	da vinci code was an acceptable follow-up, though the aformentioned plot repetition had started to bother me about halfway through dvc.	1
	now that he's done it a third time, i just can't shake how ridiculous it is that he can't try just a little harder to build a realistic plot.	1
	also, the constant reminder from several minor characters about brown's previous books was insulting.	1
	'this is the guy that ran from interpol?'	1
	thought the guard.	1
	'i've had run-ins with the vatican,' revealed robert.	1
	yes, mr. brown, we are well aware of langdon's prior adventures.	1
	your constant reminders of the other books you've written come across as desperate as a girl waiting by the phone for a boy to ask her to the dance.	1
	i'm actually sad my husband wasted his money giving this as a gift, and sad i was so excited to read it.	1
	bored to tears through much of it.	1
	do these mainstream writers even try anymore? 	1
	not up to par with his earlier works....i, along with many other people, was excited to hear that dan brown was finally coming out with another robert langdon book.	1
	it was slow starting--much slower than angels & demons and the davinci code--but eventually i couldn't put it down.	1
	unfortunately, in the end i have to say that it really wasn't worth more than 3 out of 5 stars.	1
	although it was as well-researched as dan brown's other books, i feel as if the story itself simply wasn't as gripping, and although it of course had the usual dan brown twist, i definitely don't think it was as good as the one in the da vinci code.	1
	of course, i have to admit that, it having been years and years since i read the first two robert langdon books, my taste in novels has very possibly changed.	1
	still, i would be surprised if many people really believe that this book was anywhere near as good as the first two.	1
	especially as it turned very preachy at the end--and on top of that, seemed like one big advertisement for smartphones (blackberries and iphones especially).      	1
	yeah, i've read this before... sort of..so langdon shows up at the scene of a vicious crime.	1
	surprise surprise.	1
	langdon is under suspicion.	1
	wow, there's a shocker.	1
	langdon is whisked away moments before an impending arrest by a stranger.	1
	hey, wait a sec.. didn't this happen once or twice before??	1
	then langdon must use his unbelievable skills to prove he's as clueless as he claims about the crime, and solve the riddle before something terrible happens.	1
	ahh yes, sounds familiar now, doesn't it?	1
	look, mr. brown, you had a good thing going.	1
	you just should not have tried to write the same book over again by giving it a new title, and a new setting.	1
	the so-called devastating event that everyone is afraid of, really is not very devastating.	1
	and the criminal that's been created isn't very believable (sort of freaky, in a halloween-costume-gone-bad sort of way).	1
	and why was the woman's research being targeted?	1
	did that fit in well at all with the rest of the story?	1
	i didn't think so.	1
	i got the point that her research and testing was tied in nicely with her brother's dilemma, but did it need to be targeted and destroyed?	1
	or did mr. brown just need to fill some pages and create a faux suspense to make the reader think that this story was going to be really exciting?	1
	all in all, the message is interesting.	1
	the last two or three chapters were very thought provoking.	1
	but it should have been a documentary on pbs or discovery (as i'm sure it will be soon).	1
	it should not have been the catalyst for another langdon 'save the world' book.	1
	wish i had my $[...] bucks back.	1
	if there were a cliff notes version, that would be all anyone would need.	1
	do they still make those?      	1
	not terrible but not up to par.unlike the last few novels, brown depicts his organization of interest in a wise victim rather than evil incarnate, which is a nice change.	1
	it's also nice to read a novel he has based in the us.	1
	but while this book is readable, it was still predictable and not up to the level that some of his other writing are.	1
	i would consider this a good way to bide your time between da vinci code and whatever he does next.	1
	it's not hard to put down, but not hard to pick up either.      	1
	how dark the con of man..lost from these d.c.chases are dan brown's clever and amusing names of characters evidenced in his 'the davinci code.'	1
	miss that.	1
	thought it would be his signature, such as nelson demille's clever, arrogant humor.	1
	instead, he creates a vengeful, fasting, steroided, tattooed, self-castrated, ex-drunken, rich playboy druggee, named mal'akh.	1
	that bad, bad solomon, 33rd degree mason villain, would thinks he can become a god king by tattooing a circumpunct on his head and being killed by the left hand of his dad.	1
	is it da vinci's vertruvian man that comes to mind when mal'akh assumes this position in front of a mirror and claims he is a masterpiece about to become another (castrated) god king or martyr like osiris or the first freemason, hiram abib?	1
	ahggh, his duped masons should have stoned his circumpunct with all of his make up jars.	1
	'how dark the con of man,' indeed.	1
	no point in finding fault with this fiction or berating this author any further though.	1
	i bought it and read the story, so i own it.	1
	who would mind writing something that a few million people would read?	1
	stay healthy folks.	1
	jack mellone 	1
	good book.i really don't understand why people have been so hard on this latest book by dan brown.	1
	i found the entire book very intriguing, and quite enlightening.	1
	there were some predictable plot twists, but authors have a very hard time being successful in outsmarting the reader at every turn.	1
	i believe it was very well written, and the thing i've always like about mystery/thrillers is the fact that the author usually does give you enough info to figure things out for yourself.	1
	i've seen that many other folks have been upset by the ending, and i don't understand why.	1
	the ending wasn't a huge enormous ending like the previous two robert langdon books; however, i believe it was much more relevant.	1
	this ending reminded me of (may he rest in peace) michael crichton in that he gave you something very interesting to think on after finishing the book.	1
	is it so wrong for someone to ask you to expand your mind and look at things in a different way?	1
	i would recommend this book for any person who enjoys a good story and has an open mind.      	1
	stupid main characters.the story is pretty good....lots of suspence and fun facts about masons.	1
	but the stupidity of the main characters drove me nuts.	1
	langton is so dumb when dealing with the bad guy.	1
	he has dealt with very evil people in other books, yet he appears like a newbie here...so innocent and trusting.	1
	jeez!	1
	and katherine solomon isn't much better.	1
	i wanted to reach out and shake them....or punch some sense into them.      	1
	what a bummer--the book is boring!.what a let-down!	1
	i have been waiting for dan brown's latest book, for i so enjoyed 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code.'	1
	but, if this is what he has been doing the last four years, he needs to do some more work.	1
	of course, 'the da vinci code' is a hard thriller to beat, but this work doesn't even come close to the fun, the suspense of 'the da vinci code.'	1
	the masons?	1
	yawn.	1
	and, another weird religious guy, another intelligent woman helping dan out, another mentor who is in trouble, and need i go on?	1
	the book is a weak copycat of the previous novel.	1
	while i agree with the book's message, we have sparks of divinity in each of us, that is nothing new.	1
	yes, i also believe that the founding fathers would be shocked at the rise of religious extremism in this country, but couldn't dan have written a better book to showcase that theme?	1
	i wish he had. 	1
	the plot will leave you wanting more.well, color me disappointed.	1
	it's not a 'worse' book in terms of action or dialogue than the davinci code or angels & demons.	1
	in fact, it's very similar to them in terms of pace and progression.	1
	however, it's just not very interesting.	1
	the 'grave threat' that langdon faces isn't very grave.	1
	the hidden mystery just isn't on par with the other two langdon novels either.	1
	while i found myself spellbound by the overall plot of the other two threats facing langdon, i found myself thinking 'so what?'	1
	about this one.	1
	i think maybe the freemasons aren't as mysterious and interesting, nor are they as dark and ominous and the templars or illuminati would be.	1
	more importantly, the peculiarities of washington d.c. architecture, which brown lectures on throughout the book, isn't as esoteric and surprising as the ideas postulated in the previous langdon adventures.	1
	in short, i feel like 'we've all heard this before.'	1
	where before, brown was postulating some new and interesting historical mysteries, i feel like he's moved into the wal-mart version.	1
	this doesn't seem any better written or more engaging than the host of dan brown copy-cat books that have been released in the past 5 years.	1
	it's as good as most of them, but lacks the feelings of depth and 'power' of the previous offerings.	1
	in short, i doubt anyone really cares about the great quest he has sent robert langdon on this time.	1
	it's neither believable nor suprising, which were the hallmarks of brown's previous two langdon books.	1
	certainly, it's not worth the hardcover price.	1
	luckily the kindle price is only $9.99, which suits it just fine.      	1
	the lost symbol is not a lost cause.much has been said about dan brown's failings as a writer, and this book will not help his image there at all.	1
	but, he shows he can still put together an interesting novel with fascinating historical tidbits and obscure but all-to-real science.	1
	the lost symbol succeeds as a sequel to the da vinci code.	1
	i still hold that angels & demons was his best work involving his protagonist, robert langdon.	1
	if you enjoyed those works, you'll enjoy this one.	1
	but understand that his writing is no better (how many times can you use the word esoteric in a novel), utilizing the same gimmicky short-chapters and obtrusive italics.	1
	brown would benefit from a partnership with a good writer like douglas preston- let brown do the research and outline a plot, then let preston create the narrative.	1
	to put it another way- the best star wars movies weren't directed by george lucas, though he is clearly the genius behind the stories.	1
	still, for what it is, brown makes it work.	1
	all the components are there- obscure historical facts, a healthy dose of science vs religion, and a bigger-than-life revelation, though one not quite as explosive as the davinci code's.	1
	brown telegraphs his premise very early, and i figured out the big a-ha reveal well before he spelled it out.	1
	to sum up, if you like dan brown and stories similar to the da vinci code, you'll like this book well enough.      	1
	disn't like the ending.i was disappointed  in the ending.	1
	the lead-up was great, but a dissappointing ending.	1
	i was hoping for much better!      	1
	good but not great.dan brown may not be the world's greatest writer but he does tell a good story.	1
	he gives you information, twists and turns, a character you like and usually an interesting search.	1
	unfortunately, the search is not that interesting.	1
	when langdon finally finds what he's been looking for, you really don't care.	1
	in 'davinci code', the idea behind the search was interesting and ignited your imagination.	1
	unfortunately, my imagination was not ignited in this book.	1
	i knew the bad guy's identity half-way through which is not a great sign.still, it was an entertaining read but not one i would pass on to my friends and say, 'you really have to read this.'	1
	probably dan brown's worst.i was a fan, read all four of his previous books.	1
	it appears that his success has affected his work.	1
	took too many chapters to get into the subject of the book, too much unneeded background infomration.	1
	too many chapters and preaching after the climax.	1
	the basic story was partly believable, but didn't have the realism of (this could happen or it could be true) his previous works.	1
	langdon was a complete wimp in this book.	1
	a big disappointment.        	1
	it almost had me.i have been a dedicated reader of books which explore that which lives below the surface.	1
	it started i hate to say with chariots of the gods.	1
	with that said i plowed through lost symbol and truly was totally absorbed, fascinated, and thoughtfully stimulated on my favorite subjectuntil the end.	1
	dan brown has a way of getting into arcana in his books that provide an incredibly good story while explaining something that many of us yearn to know, why are we here?	1
	unfortunately when i got to the end it ended in a bust!	1
	i know from working for the government that many secrets are surpisingly obvious and not that revelatory.	1
	dan brown's ending was not revelatory.	1
	it did not hold the secret of such magnitude that it must be held back from the public lest it cause mass turmoil.	1
	now, noetics that was quite interesting and revelatory but not dan's ending.	1
	to have such a blah ending to such a gripping ride through the arcane history of the masons and the history of our nation's capitol was just not a worthy ending.	1
	elsewise the book was great but alas at the end it felt like eating white bread.	1
	no satisfaction.	1
	no drive to continue to ask what lies under the surface.      	1
	ok, interesting at points, disappointing at others.while dan brown's works usually require you to actively suspend your disbelief, his past works have done so in a way that do not strain the reader too much.	1
	unfortunately, i cannot say that about this book.	1
	the symbology that brown uses in this story is top-notch.	1
	he depicts features of the u.s. capitol building that very few probably ever think about.	1
	professor langdon's teaching scenes are entertaining (and i'd probably enjoy a class like langdon's).	1
	brown uses this mythology well and crafts an intriguing page turner (at times).	1
	the villain is a bit of a disappointment.	1
	the motivations are never clear until near the climax of the story, and the villain's role seems weaker without the shadowy 'controller' that worked behind the scenes in the davinci code.	1
	the entire 'noetic science' meme is a weak plot device.	1
	brown risks turning the story into a spoof of his own works.	1
	brown could have used the meme of greed in capitalism to achieve the same plot movement without the strain on credulity.	1
	the same goes for the 'resurrection' of one of the characters (no spoilers from me).	1
	i'm glad i ordered the kindle version of this book.	1
	for ten bucks, i feel like i got my money's worth.	1
	had i paid for the print version (discounted or full price), i would have felt like i did not get my money's worth.  	1
	disappointed.after all these years of waiting for the 'new' dan brown book mr. brown has published a throwaway, a money maker, a huge disappointment.	1
	where the da vinci code was a good story bringing to popular fiction a story that has been known for over 200 years, his new book is just your average chase book.	1
	there is no 'lost symbol'.	1
	we have read these so many times, robert ludlum perfected this type of chase and wrote some good stories around it.this new book is for the most part boring.	1
	there are no new revelations being brought to light.	1
	in the end we are very disappointed.	1
	also, i feel i got sucked in by the promise of something terrific.	1
	normally, i would give a book like this 50-75 pages and then i'd put it down forever.	1
	this is a poorly written book with a not very interesting story.	1
	much of what he asks us to believe about the bad guy is just dribble..crap.	1
	so poorly written that i looked forward to his being only a tiny part of the book instead of the huge portion of the book brown assigns him.do not waste your time on this book.      	1
	familiar...maybe a little too familiar.i am in the middle of the lost symbol a the moment, yes i have not fiished it yet.	1
	i just felt compelled to share some of my feelings.	1
	first of all dan brown is not a writers writer; he is not creating some grand piece of literature here.	1
	he aims for suspense over substance and at times his style is a bit sophomoric.	1
	lets face it the formula for the lost symbol, is the same as it was in the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	aren't authors supposed to grow and change with time and experience?	1
	his characters are not likeable at all, however having said that how can he really flesh out his characters when he spends most of his time trying to educate us about the apotheosis of washington and the vastness of freemasonry?	1
	quite honsetly i find his writing style hokey, especially the villanous parts.	1
	every time i get to the chapters with mala'kh i roll my eyes and skim through.obviously dan brown has learned that once something works, don't stray.	1
	he's not offering us anything new here except location.       	1
	very frustrating.i was very frustrated reading this.	1
	there were several situations that were too predictable and many that never would have happened if the participants were as smart as dan brown tried to make them out to be.	1
	it seems mr. brown struggled to use his past accomplishments to sell a newer, lesser book.	1
	it seems to have worked too.      	1
	a positive message for a change.i found this book ultimately more satisfying than the 'the da vinci code,' which i had also enjoyed.	1
	yes, brown has a formula, and his characters' dialogue can make you wince (especially so near the end of this book -- the exchanges between the two main characters are almost painful to read, as brown tries to convey his own quasi-mystical views through robert and katherine), but still, the book was a fun, fascinating read.	1
	moreover, the underlying motive of the book strikes me as far more positive than that of 'the da vinci code.'	1
	rather than tear down, this time brown is trying to build up, to affirm a positive message.	1
	the message itself may be a bit vague and fuzzy, but it is positive and hopeful.      	1
	another page turner knock-out.unlike the da vinci code this time page turner dan brown sets the action and keeps it in washington dc.	1
	i won't go into the plot details as many others have already done that here.	1
	suffice it to say this time it involves the masons and the upper echelons of us government.	1
	obviously this novel isn't to be judged on high literary merits, but in terms of pop novel entertainment, it rates high.	1
	i stayed up late into the night to find out the denouement of the story.	1
	the secret being sought is not as interesting as in the da vinci code, but fascinating nonetheless.	1
	in my opinion all the negative reviews are just plain jealousy.	1
	if it is so easy to write a page turner all of us would be on the bestseller list too.      	1
	haven't we read this story already?.forgive me, but i am going to break from my normal format of first offering a short synopsis of the book, followed by my 2 cents worth.	1
	i feel like i just read the same 500 page book for the third time.	1
	just see the summaries of the davinci code or angels & demons - the story lines are nearly identical, but in the lost code we are in washington dc discovering the long lost secrets of the masons instead of the knights templar in england, or the catholic church in rome.	1
	'a diabolical madman is threatening to destroy the world's religious orders by exposing the 'truth' through a series of secret codes, paintings, rituals, and ancient symbols.	1
	at stake is the most significant treasure the world has ever known.	1
	if the treasure falls into the hands of the evil one, chaos will ensue, all of the world's religions will be exposed as fraudulent and cease to exist.	1
	it is up to robert langdon to solve the cryptic riddles and thwart the evil one and stop the human sacrifices.'	1
	this could preface any of the three books.	1
	seriously, i respect an author's right to sell his work and become wealthy doing so, but this is a study in redundancy.	1
	his formula for selling a blockbuster is much too shallow and transparent, much like the national treasure movies.	1
	the first one was cutting edge and captured the imagination, but the later installments were written and produced for no other reason than to cash-in on the success of the original.	1
	we were sold the same story with a different cover.	1
	i can't help but feel like the lost symbol was commissioned by hollywood to support the sequel to the davinci code and angels & demons.	1
	a screenplay masquerading as a novel.	1
	the most important thing to remember is that all three of these books are works of fiction.	1
	despite the ingenious marketing campaign that promoted the controversy of brown's ability to blur the line between biblical scripture and and conspiracy theory, the entire premise is purely fictional.	1
	i did enjoy the book, as i love the cryptic puzzles; it was a compelling story.	1
	however, if you expect the lost symbol to be anything other than a repackaging of the first two books, you will surely be disappointed.	1
	save your money.	1
	hardback528 pages6 1/4 hours       	1
	much slower than earlier books [3.5 stars].dan brown's the lost symbol continues the adventures of robert langdon, harvard professor of symbology, a genius with an eidetic memory whose peculiar ability to interpret symbols lands him in hot water more often than his job description would lead you to suspect.	1
	this time around langdon is summoned to washington d.c. by an old friend, peter solomon, who asks him at the last minute to give a talk in the capitol's statuary hall.	1
	needless to say, the trip doesn't go as planned, and langdon finds himself plunged into yet another crisis, this one brought on by a religious crazy with a thing for tattoos.	1
	saving the world--or at least the united states--involves langdon in a sort of treasure hunt that leads him to explore the masonic underpinnings of the country and the masonic imagery that decorates many of its monuments.	1
	i've enjoyed dan brown's books in the past because they are--or have been--page-turners.	1
	the davinci code, for example, starts with an exciting scene, as a killer chases the curator of the louvre through the museum.	1
	strangely--unfortunately--the lost symbol is very slow to get going.	1
	the action doesn't begin in earnest until about a third of the way in.	1
	instead, there's a lot of exposition--langdon explaining the significance of this or that symbol.	1
	when things do finally get moving the story moves quickly, though it's still periodically slowed by further explanatory passages.	1
	similarly, the final ten percent or so of the book is extremely dull, the surviving characters blathering on about religion with the unwelcome fervor of evangelical door-knockers.	1
	this 50-odd pages of boring (mostly) dialogue is tacked on after the dramatic stuff is over, which is to say that it's close to completely unnecessary to the story.	1
	it's also hard to believe, after everything the characters have been through by this point, that they'd opt to tour some washington landmarks and lecture one another about religion and science instead of going home to nap.	1
	this part really should have been cut.	1
	a few other things bothered me about the book.	1
	in no particular order: -- inoue sato, director of the cia's office of security, does not come off as a credible character.	1
	i also found it impossible not to picture her as the diminutive, accented seamstress in the incredibles.	1
	-- particularly in the first third of the book, the prose is interrupted frequently by the characters' italicized thoughts.	1
	used more sparingly, this would have been fine, but it's overdone, the must mundane of thoughts sometimes meriting this kind of attention: 'langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return the call.	1
	'_i hope he's okay._' -- in addition to threatening the lives of langdon's friends, the chaos planned by this book's bad guy also threatens national security, as we're frequently told.	1
	hence the involvement of the cia.	1
	but while the impending crisis might indeed have serious repercussions, it somehow fails to terrify.	1
	it's rather like threatening someone with a really bad splinter that will eventually become infected and might result in the loss of a limb.	1
	worrisome, to be sure, but it doesn't get one's attention the way, say, the threat of a gouged-out eyeball would.	1
	-- for all his brilliance and his ability to make startling intellectual leaps, langdon sometimes comes across as profoundly stubborn and rather slow.	1
	(i actually beat him in recognizing the meaning of one series of symbols near the book's end.	1
	this does not speak well for robert.)	1
	-- it was inevitable that some drama or other would play out in the pitch dark of pod 5 of the smithsonian museum support center, where katherine solomon, peter solomon's sister, has her lab.	1
	i thus understand why things had to be left dark for dramatic reasons, but for the life of me i can't imagine otherwise why the woman never invested in a flashlight.	1
	in short, a lot bothered me about the story, but the main problem is that it's a good hundred pages too long.	1
	cut out the lectures so the book is action-packed right out of the gate and doesn't end with a whimper, and it would be a much better read, on a par with the author's earlier works.	1
	-- debra hamel      	1
	i pre-ordered it.	1
	i waited anxiously to receive it....and then i could not wait for it to end -- and was disappointed by even the ending!!	1
	brown repeated himself ad nauseum page after page after page and then tacked on one of the absolute worst endings i've ever read.	1
	i hope mr. brown doesn't plan on continuing this series with robert langdon -- i doubt there is anyone who would waste their money on the next one -- i know i won't.  	1
	a page turner.i couldn't put the lost symbol down until i had finished it.	1
	at the same time, i was not as engaged by this story as i had been with author dan brown's previous books.	1
	i found the plot a bit implausible, a bit too intricate, with all its many twists.	1
	one aspect in particular i won't mention, so as not to be a spoiler.	1
	still, nobody does this type of of techno-thriller better than brown does, even if the techno part here does bog down at points.	1
	in no way does this discredit the width and the depth of brown's research.	1
	his detail is enormous, past the point of counting all of the new bytes of information he shares with his readers.	1
	as always with dan brown, there's much that will be pondered long after the book has been completed, especially the startling new information about noetic science.	1
	i found the lost symbol a tough read, albeit a worthwhile one, and i am glad that i finished it.      	1
	aren't we all being a little hard on dan?.come on, folks.	1
	it wasn't that bad.	1
	i read 2-3 books per week and this one held my interest, kept me off the internet, up past my bed time to finish it...to me that makes it a good read.	1
	i've read the other brown books so i knew what to expect and i wasn't disappointed.	1
	compared to any other mystery/thriller out on the market today this book deserves some attention.	1
	go have some fun.      	1
	as above, so below.after reading five books by dan brown, i think i finally have him figured out.	1
	sure, i might be slower on the uptake than others, but bear with me.	1
	the things he does best is weave, and i use that term lightly, popular culture, high technology, pseudo-science, and mystical esoterica into what one can best describe as a 'fictional narrative' but what is, in fact, lecture notes disguised as literature.	1
	the best part of any dan brown novel is the interest i, personally, get in hunting down his source work and researching more of the topics and technologies that he puts forth.	1
	my inner-nerd ocd runs overtime the days after finishing one of his books.	1
	so i got that going for me, which is nice.	1
	in his newest work, the lost symbol, dan brown focuses on the masonic order (the freemasons) rather than the knights templar, the catholic church, nasa, rouge ai, or sharks with laser beams on their heads (that was in deception point, right?	1
	); and places the action in the mystically aligned washington dc.	1
	seems that hero robert langdon was summoned to dc under mysterious pretenses, and so begins the historical trek through the city once known as rome to its builders.	1
	the lost symbol is filled with little known facts, legendary artifacts, lots of running, a thrill or two, and intellectual jargoning.	1
	if you are into that sort of thing, please, by all means, read this book, and enjoy (despite what you will read, i did enjoy the book on that level).	1
	if you are particularly focused, you could burn through the book in a good six or seven hours.	1
	thanks to the lost symbol, i really want to visit washington dc again, this time with a better trained eye, and hit up the smithsonian.	1
	i also have taken a deeper look into noetic sciences and ordered a few books.	1
	now the problem arises though, as i mentioned before, after getting acquainted with the author's writing style and his use of 'cheats'.	1
	dan brown's 'narrative' is cognitively disjointed and removed from how people actually are.	1
	the 'cheat' here is in the heavy use of intense flashback to fill in the plot.	1
	that is a cheat, only because people in the situations he puts his characters in his book would never be able to, in real life, have intense, detailed flashbacks, in the time frame given.	1
	it just does not happen.	1
	while it serves to fill the reader in on plot details, it 'pauses' the action for the reader too unnaturally long.	1
	in the lost symbol, an iphone is mentioned, by name, often enough where the reader begins to think 'how much did apple pay him for this?'	1
	the second cheat dan brown uses is his exposition.	1
	the conversation between langdon and teabing in teabing's chateau in the superior da vinci code was chill inducing; not because of the information being presented, but because of the way it was being presented.	1
	intellectuals might very well argue this way in an environment more conducive to, well, arguing, but if you are 1) on the run from cops and 2) on the run from an albino assassin, one does not stop to explain the entire occult history of the catholic church.	1
	but i digress.	1
	half the conversations in the lost symbol would never happen in real life.	1
	almost all of his 'smart' characters are people you never want to invite to parties...sure, they might be good for a different opinion or four, but you would be finishing up a six pack and bowl of pretzels before they took a breath.	1
	a basic conversation would go like this: 'so, robert, what do you think of national health care?'	1
	'as we all know, health care originated in coptic ethiopia when, considering the root etymological form of 'healthcare' is heal which in greek....blah blah blah'.	1
	what is truly appalling is that these 'conversations' are merely literary sheaths for dan brown's library notes.	1
	finally, robert langdon.	1
	many, many authors are guilty of the 'robert langdon', basing their titular characters on themselves.	1
	i got into robert langdon in angels & demons (better book than da vinci code or the lost symbol).	1
	he kind of lost me though, half way through da vinci code, and in the lost symbol, i was done.	1
	dan brown is basing this character on himself, supposedly.	1
	mid 40s, ruggedly good looks, tweed jacket, insufferable genius, in great shape for his age, harvard professor, played water polo in college.	1
	yes, that's right, water polo.	1
	i have nothing against water polo, but if you are just going to completely fantasize yourself as an intellectual indiana jones why not give yourself esp and retractable adamantium claws while you are at it.	1
	these know everything and do everything author homunculi are getting long in the tooth.	1
	i would not be surprised that in dan brown's fourth book in the series, the bimini road, robert langdon discovers atlantis due to his sudden ability to breathe underwater and converse in ancient druidic with a long lost tribe of sea apes.	1
	i just made that last sentence up.	1
	boring and a repeat.in dan brown's previous books he did a great job of blending history with the story at hand.	1
	this book felt more like two books forced together.	1
	you read some dialogue, then have to read a five page history lesson, then back to dialogue.	1
	i found myself zipping past the history lesson and looking for dialogue to at least follow just the story.	1
	it wasn't a horrible book, but not what i was expecting from mr. brown based on past experience with his prior novels.	1
	if you are new to dan brown, skip this and read his earlier works.	1
	if you have read the others, know that the story line is much like prior books, in fact at several points his main character even points out that the event at hand is just like events in prior novels.	1
	the ending is really over long; ultimately i put the book down because i didn't care that the bad guy was out of the picture and why.	1
	the characters kept going on like a pack of kids with add.	1
	i just wanted to escape.	1
	the symbol is lost; let's keep it that way.       	1
	lost in translation.i have little more to add that wasn't already delightfully expressed in that classic review 'i'm pretty sure it went down like this.'	1
	i had the same reaction to this book i had really anticipated.	1
	it was a total botch trying to capitalize on the earlier titles.	1
	i could not believe how tediously religious it was getting.	1
	i finally gave up in the last few pages and stopped reading.	1
	spare us the religious stuff, dan; we get enough of that hypocrisy on cnn.       	1
	too many words not enough ideas.he must have been paid by the word, i thought it would never end.	1
	as you slog thru the verbage the ancient knowledge has to include time travel.	1
	similar to deception point and maybe the worst of the 5 he has written.	1
	the timeline of the action is so out of whack the rest of the plot devices lose any credibility and serious contemplation.	1
	as bad as d.p and digital fortress are the beating to death of the ancient knowledge in this book is far worse.	1
	no new ideas, if you have read his previous work this one won't have any surprizes.             	1
	what  is next for brown?.this is a formula novel in the tradition of robin cook and patricia cornwall.	1
	what is the next group for brown's conspiracies?perhaps bnai brith or the jesuits will b next.	1
	i for one won't waste my time reading it.      	1
	waste of money.i wasted money buying this.	1
	it was too esoteric, puzzling, needed a dictionary to cope with some of the sects and references to arcane practises and beliefs.	1
	characters were weak, the fenale cia chief was totally unbelievable.	1
	never again	1
	this was a 'so what' book....i am sure i am not the only one who said, 'sooo???'	1
	when we finally found out what was in the super duper secret briefcase.	1
	national security??	1
	i thought surely with the way this horrible event was being portrayed that thousands of lives would be at stake.	1
	i hoped that maybe i'd start to really get it, but as he hammered the point over and over, i started to realize he was trying to convince himself more than the reader.	1
	the nonsense continued throughout with the silly death scene, the completely unnecessary inclusion of the constant discussion of advanced spoon bending (why was this in the book??	1
	it had no place or purpose there), and the complete lack of common sense by the characters who kept letting the cliche villain get the better of them over and over.	1
	as a big dan brown fan, i was even more disappointed.	1
	waiting for the next big book by a favorite author is so exciting, but this one really let me down.	1
	sadly, if this has been my first dan brown book, it would have warranted him being added to my short 'do not buy' list.	1
	interesting but flawed (spoilers).on the positive side, the book kept me interested enough to finish it, and i did learn some interesting things about etymology and architecture.	1
	the production value is very high, with good typography, interesting glyphs, and good design.	1
	there were several flaws, however.	1
	first, there was too much profanity.	1
	on the other hand, virtually nobody else seems bothered by this, so if it does not bother you, you can ignore this complaint.	1
	second, the description of entanglement and the supposed anticipation of string theory in ancient scriptures was unconvincing, speaking as someone acquainted with the issues.	1
	third, the relationship between zack and peter is presented pretentiously.	1
	most of the description involved the author repeatedly complaining that zack did not listen to the advice of his supposedly 'wiser' father.	1
	brown pompously complains that zack had 'shunned his parents' exhaustive attempts to provide him firm and loving guidance.'	1
	the endless repetitions of zack's skepticism as to peter's supposed wisdom were like the screeching of a senescent parent vapidly insisting on his own wisdom.	1
	fourth, the ending was very poor and mooted most of the rest of the plot, not to mention belying the theory that peter is as wise as he thinks: there's no reason for peter to have gone through so much to have protected the most innocuous secret i've seen in a thriller.      	1
	i expected more.this book is disappointing at best.	1
	if you've read the davinci code or angels and demons, look for the same plot line.	1
	all the books start out with something dead on the floor (a body or hand) that point to something that only our distinguished hero can decipher.	1
	there is absolutely no love interest between the hero and heroine and other than mutual admiration for their intellect, the chemistry falls flat.	1
	the villans are either albinos (davinci code) or tatooed men (lost symbol) and the cast of other characters read from something out of a side show at the circus.	1
	after all the hype--joining dan brown's fan club on facebook with fantastic ciphers (thanks guys!	1
	), reading all the pre-sale articles and waiting for september 15 to come around, i was let down.	1
	granted, it was a quick read (6 hours is about right), and one chapter lead to the next (couldn't put it down), i really was hoping for a better ending.	1
	the davinci code started me on a 3-year journey and quest for truth.	1
	but this book was not the answer i was looking for.	1
	maybe having more questions and wanting to search for more information is really what this book does in the end.	1
	if you've never read dan brown, this book is good.	1
	if you have read him, read this anyway and judge for yourself.	1
	the truth lies within each of us.      	1
	major disappointment.i was highly anticipating this book, but alas, it was a tedious and unimaginative read.	1
	it reminded me of sitting through a bad lecture or reading an instruction manual.	1
	sorry i purchased it.       	1
	obvious work of fiction.one of the craziest ideas in this book that proves this is a work of fiction: the washington redskins are in the playoffs.	1
	decent book.	1
	always a mix of facts and crazy conjectures with dan brown.      	1
	tense, thrilling and it kept me up all night.mal'akh is about to take an oath administered by peter solomon, the supreme, worshipful master of the masons in washington dc.	1
	he is about to reach the highest level in the masonic order, but even so, he knows he will not be admitted to the most secret secrets.	1
	secrets that he's sworn to protect.	1
	he is not what he seems to his fellow masons.	1
	he's lied to them.	1
	he has his own agenda.	1
	later harvard professor and symbologist robert langdon comes to washington to make a speech, but finds peter solomon's severed right hand instead of a crowded room.	1
	the hand's fingertips have been tattooed with symbols.	1
	peter has been kidnapped, is in danger of being killed and to save him, the kidnapper, mal'akh, wants langdon to do what he does best, follow a series of symbols that will lead him through a washington that most know nothing about.	1
	mal'akh is after the wisdom of the ages, which has been protected by the masons throughout the ages.	1
	peter solomon can only get him so far in his search.	1
	symbols need to be deciphered and only langdon has the knowledge to decode them.	1
	and thus the chase is on.	1
	langdon teams up with peter's scientist sister, who is working on a science that will revolutionize mankind, to try and find that which mal'akh is after, before he kills peter.	1
	however, the secret symbols throughout the nation's capitol are not all langdon has to navigate through.	1
	apparently the cia doesn't want him to succeed so they send the men in black after him with their helicopters and high tech gear.	1
	it will take all his ability to stay a jump ahead of them, but he has to, because if he doesn't, his friend dies.	1
	i liked robert langdon as a character.	1
	i particularly liked the fact that he makes mistakes, is fooled by mal'akh more than once.	1
	it makes him more human.	1
	the severely tattooed mal'akh is about as dastardly as they come.	1
	he will do anything, say anything, kill anyone to get what he's after.	1
	i waited five years for this book, a long time.	1
	i read it instead of sleeping last night.	1
	it was worth it.	1
	reviewed by stephanie sane      	1
	the 'word' is... unclear..=the da vinci code= was a hard act to follow, and i can't say that dan brown either met or exceeded the standards he established in his previous book, which discredited (nay, virtually decimated) christianity and exposed the many atrocities committed in its name, to the delight of many who were really sick of the christian fascism exhibited by so many far right-wing republicans during the bush administration.	1
	dan brown books always contain a large amounts of very interesting background information and this one didn't disappoint in that area, with its many details about masonry, noetic science, symbolism in paintings by albrecht durer, references to hidden science in ancient scripture, mysticism, the relationship between the mind and quantum physics, the power of intention, the effects of meditation, and attaining mental powers by merging with 'the one'.	1
	the author talked a great deal about the 'lost word', the 'ineffable word'--- which, if a person were to discover it or accidentally say it, he could become instantly enlightened and endowed with omniscience and an understanding of buried ancient mysteries that have been sought by masons, rosicrucians, philosophers, meditators, alchemists, and other assorted occultists.	1
	but one of the places where the book failed for me is how at the end, the author is not terribly clear about what his definition of the lost word exactly is.	1
	first he says it's a circumpunct, a circle with a dot inside of it that represents the source or merging with the one, which makes a great deal of sense from a mystical or eastern philosophy standpoint.	1
	but then he starts talking about how 'the word' equals the bible, where some have found hidden scientific meanings.	1
	or, 'laus deo', which translates as 'praise god'.	1
	or, 'jeova santus unus', which translates as 'one true god'.	1
	so--- the thing that offends me about the end of the book is that first he comes to a mystical solution, but then it seems like he twists it to make it sound like a christian solution.	1
	it's almost as though he was coming to the end of a really good book, but then a bunch of republicans kidnapped him, took him into a room and told him how his previous book made them really  mad, and then they forced him to put a christian twist onto the end of this one.	1
	it would make sense, from a masonic standpoint, to 'merge' all religions together at the end of the book, because masonry does merge all religions, but it just seemed to me that with all of the expostulating about 'praise god' and 'the word equals the bible' and 'one true god' that he was coming to more of a christian conclusion, which to me was disappointing and somewhat offensive.	1
	at the very end, he speaks of 'god' as a symbol of man's potential, but i guess the fact that is sounded like a male god instead of an androgynous 'god' made it seem christian to me instead of universal.	1
	the character mal'akh made more sense, in a weird sociopathic way, when he was talking about trying to attain 'fleshless sentience' (that would occur during meditation) and his statement about how god had no gender and was an androgyne.	1
	that is what the ancients believed and it makes sense today, because:  asking a woman to worship a male god is sexist, and diminishes the woman.	1
	asking a black person to worship a white god is racist and diminishes the black person, asking a homosexual to worship a chaste heterosexual makes no sense, and asking the mother of a child to worship a 'pure' virgin makes her seem unclean because she has been de-virginated.	1
	i was also interested in the 'john gesture' made by the severed hand and made in what dan brown says are three of leonardo's paintings (but it is also made by the baby representing john the baptist in the madonna of the rocks, so it's actually in four of leonardo's paintings).	1
	i read something in madame blavatsky about how a raised index finger was supposed to signify 'back to the grove', i.e., back to the paganism, back to the mystery schools that practiced sacred sexuality and rituals that killed the king so that the crops could grow, but he was always 'risen' or resurrected by a woman, with whom he then 'merged' sexually in the same way that mystics merge with the one.	1
	actually, in leonardo's painting of st. john the baptist, his forefinger is 'risen' but so is another part of his anatomy, which would tie in with the whole sacred sexuality aspect of madame blavatsky's explanation of the gesture.	1
	but--- dan brown just says that this gesture, also depicted in a statue of george washington, is 'a well-known symbol of the ancient mysteries' and an invitation to be initiated into mysteries or ancient knowledge (or the hieros gamos).	1
	another thing that bothered me about the book:  katherine, the noetic scientist, talks about how 'today's science was not so much making 'discoveries' as it was making 'rediscoveries'' because mankind had 'let go' what they once knew.	1
	well, i think the author should have pointed out that the reason much of the ancient science was lost was because christians (and also muslims) burned the library of alexandria, in their attempts to destroy paganism and science and enhance religion, and that efforts to nourish science were further inhibited by the church during the 1000 years following the fall of rome, which were completely dominated by christianity.	1
	anyway, it's a very interesting book--- but the conclusion is ... somewhat murky.      	1
	where do you even begin?.ok - this is my first time reviewing a book, but the lost symbol is so bad it merits some remarks.	1
	i think the best way to sum up the book is that i kept waiting to read that stating the phrase 'ice cream sundae' is really a code for people who are excited to go to church: 'i scream sunday'.	1
	in other words, dan brown finds the craziest explanations he can find for chritian ideals and passes them off as obvious fact.	1
	if you are looking for a book that is about 150 pages too long, makes fun of anyone who believes in a specific deity (especially christians), and whose plot is entirely predictable, then i highly recommend this book.      	1
	i feel ripped off.oh i had waited sooo long for this book.	1
	i am sorry to say it was a huge disappointment.	1
	it is not a thriller.	1
	it could have been because there was a creepy story in there but it fell so far short of a page turner.	1
	i really had a hard time finishing it.	1
	one interesting twist- that's all!	1
	i don't know how to categorize this book.	1
	is it historical fiction?	1
	is it a religious treatise?	1
	is it a commercial for the masons?	1
	truly wish i had not pre-ordered and had read reviews.	1
	might have read it in paperback.      	1
	a waste of time and effort.this book was a waste of his time.	1
	yes there was some mystery and some thrills but the whole story was poorly done.	1
	he should have just started with a different character and moved along a more interesting story line.      	1
	a huge letdown.i knew that 'the davici code' would be a tough act to follow, especially with all of the books and movies that have tried to capitalize on that genre since the davici code came out.	1
	i thought the book started slow (for the first couple hundred pages or so) and then picked up some speed.	1
	it slowed down considerably after the evil character (for lack of a better term) finished his part and i've now spent the last three days trying to get through the last 40 or so pages.	1
	i can't see this being made into a movie.	1
	if it is i would likely go see it just to see the sites in washington but it certainly wouldn't be for the story.      	1
	don't buy it -- don't even borrow it.i pre-ordered it.	1
	i waited anxiously to receive it.	1
	and then i could not wait for it to end -- and was disappointed by even the ending!!	1
	brown repeated himself ad nauseum page after page after page and then tacked on one of the absolute worst endings i've ever read.	1
	i hope mr. brown doesn't plan on continuing this series with robert langdon -- i doubt there is anyone who would waste their money on the next one -- i know i won't.      	1
	spare me!.this book was an utter waste of time!	1
	the cia?	1
	come on -- if we're supposed to believe there was a threat to national security, then we're all supposed to be stupid, and it would have been the fbi in any event.	1
	zachary?	1
	just not believable.	1
	and if solomon could recover that quickly to get to, ascend to the top of and then walk down the spiral staircase from the top of the washington monument, then he was a totally unbelievable character.	1
	not to mention that the shower of shards only got to ma'lakh?	1
	the editing was poor but could have been forgiven if this book had any claim at all to my 'willing suspension of disbelief,' but by the end of it i was thoroughly disgusted.	1
	thank you, kindle for letting me only waste $9.99 rather than the full list price!      	1
	so sad.i have read all of the dan brown books.	1
	after so many years waiting for a follow-up to the previous good works by dan brown, i feel that this book has a great deal of research/information about symbols in washington and a very slim plotline.	1
	i pre-ordered the unabridged audio version.	1
	there are 15 cds.	1
	i am on the 9th cd and i can barely get through it.	1
	with a background in medieval literature, i enjoy symbols and archetypes and all of that wonderful literary fun, but this is supposed to be a novel, not a textbook on symbols.	1
	at 2/3 of the way through it, i feel certain that i can guess how it all turns out.	1
	and if i'm surprised, it won't even be fun.	1
	this is a slow, wordy book.	1
	it should have been edited a whole lot more.	1
	all in all, i wish i had waited to order it -- with another rewrite, it could be good, but a lot shorter.	1
	and, actually, hasn't the masonic thing been done to death since the davinci code?	1
	the characters are not fleshed out enough to care about them.	1
	even robert langdon seems to have gone weak in the knees.	1
	no one can have a great success every time, but this is so sad.	1
	i had really hoped for an enjoyable, suspenseful novel.	1
	his first book was more of a page-turner than this one.	1
	maybe the next one will be better.      	1
	horrible.....horrible i say.alright to list a few stupid things in the book: 1) noetic science....what?!	1
	?2) superhuman giant white tattoed guy...really?3) cia getting involved in chasing a lunatic to protect everyone from knowing all the people involved with a secret organization...hope the cia has better things to do in real life4) where it was hidden....really no one saw that coming?5) the drowning.....hahahahahahahaha6) the bible.....this one takes the cake what a disaster by dan brown.	1
	it will take a lot of convincing for me to buy another book by you....      	1
	it's dan brown, what do you want?.the lost symbol came to my mailbox on tuesday night.	1
	by wednesday night, i had finished the whole book.	1
	it took me tuesday till midnight, then after work wednesday till around 5:30. and that's the beauty of dan brown.	1
	his books are like popular blockbuster movies.	1
	they're not artsy, they're not impressive in any way other than, hey, that was entertaining and i do not regret paying for that.	1
	this is a perfect book to take on an airplane flight, a vacation, or out to the pool with you.	1
	it's fun, it's captivating and like all of his books, it's an easy read.	1
	whatever your feelings about the da vinci code, you will like this book slightly less than that book.	1
	if you thought da vinci code was great, this is good.	1
	if you thought it was so-so, this is mediocre.       	1
	what a disappointment!.i have read all of dan brown's books, this book does not meet the engaging standard i would have hoped.	1
	boring.      	1
	nonetheless.this book was no davinci code.	1
	too cliff clavenytoo predictabletoo slowand if i never see the word 'nonetheless' in a book ever again, it won't be too soon.it does however make me want to take a tour of dc.	1
	so that's a plus.      	1
	too much like his others.dan brown's latest book has come out and sold a lot of copies and i went out and got mine.	1
	i read annoyingly fast, so i finished it in four or five hours total (i would love to know what reading level this is supposed to be, harry potters book 4-7 all took longer than this).	1
	it made me decide that i don't need to read any more dan brown books.	1
	i loved angels & demons, i thought it was a great story and had some great controversies that really made me think.	1
	i thought da vinci code was okay.	1
	i thought deception point was somewhere in between the two langdon books, and this one would go below that.	1
	his books are incredibly formulaic.	1
	this one contains someone langdon knows getting into trouble, him working with a woman to solve the mystery and save the other person, a security officer with authority that langdon does not trust, and a bad guy who hurts himself and does it all for a higher power.	1
	do any of those sound familiar?	1
	also, his watch is referenced several times, he gets trapped or has to travel through many small spaces, and at one point, it looks like he is dead!	1
	there are even more similarities including god vs science, what religion is, and many more.	1
	please dan brown, think of something new!	1
	these books all seem to be the same!	1
	i was looking forward to this book quite a lot for one reason - the setting.	1
	washington dc is one of my favorite cities and i was looking forward to knowing a lot about the locations that were in the book (plus, langdon traveling from harvard to dc made a lot of sense).	1
	in that, i was not disappointed.	1
	i learned more about two famous dc landmarks and when they traveled on the metro, i knew exactly where they were at all times.	1
	i also am interested in freemasons.	1
	i knew someone in college that was one 9only the 5th or 6th level) and while he couldn't tell us most things, what he told me about his beliefs was very interested, so i was excited that they would be a central part of this story.	1
	that also was not a disappointment.	1
	i did learn quite a bit about the beliefs.	1
	those two things could not save the book.	1
	dan brown just needs to write better (and his editors need do more).	1
	if a better writer had written this book, i would have enjoyed it a lot more.	1
	if you liked his first langdon books, you may be disappointed because it is so similar, which really, in the end, was my main disappointment.	1
	i think robert langdon has a lot of potential as an interesting character to build a series on, but there needs to be more differences.	1
	don't necessarily take my word for it.	1
	go form an opinion of your own!       	1
	thriller, yes; worth it, no; quite disappointed....i've started the book on september 15, and have recently finished it.	1
	overall the book is again a dan brown's fantastic thriller since i was not able to stop myself reading for more and more until the last chapters.	1
	but when everything came to the last chapters, frankly, i was disappointed.	1
	i will not enclose the reasons since this is a new book and yet it has not penetrated the market totally; but i'd say don't expect what you had experienced in the da vinci code if you read it.	1
	and one last remark.	1
	if this book is to be a masterpiece, i'd say it will be, but not literally, rather in marketing.	1
	so much has it achieved in marketing, with a various numbers of publishers, the book became available almost all around the world as of september 15. that's what makes it a masterpiece.        	1
	half fantasy, half religous tract.first all, i enjoyed dan brown's previous books tremendously, particularly 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci' code.	1
	it's said that in his books he takes certain liberties with historical facts -- he got a fair amount of heat for that over the two books named, to the point that people felt they needed to counter it by writing other books explaining the fallacies, especially with regard to information about jesus, mary, and the catholic church.	1
	but of course we all realize it's fiction, not fact.	1
	however this book leaves his others behind when it comes to accurate representation of facts, we are into pure fantasy for most of the book.	1
	near the beginning we learn there is scientific research that shows people can influence external objects using only their mind, reinforcing the ideas behind esp and telekinesis.	1
	of course there is no such scientific evidence.	1
	later on, a researcher accurately weighs someone as they're dying, and in so doing determines the weight of the 'soul' leaving the body.	1
	in this case not only is the scientific evidence lacking to support that, the experiment has actually been done, and with exactly the opposite result -- there's no weight change during death.	1
	brown has apparently drunk the dean koontz kool-aid and crossed over into accepting the reality of spirits, demons, etc.	1
	the final quarter of the book could be considered a religious tract.	1
	is this book perhaps penance for his previous works?	1
	is brown trying to appease the church by winning converts for them with this book?	1
	or has he recently had a religious experience or conversion of his own, and is just trying to share the 'good news' through his work?	1
	combine that with 'twists' that are telegraphed long in advance and aren't the least surprising (at least to anyone who reads mysteries or brown's previous books); various new weapon technologies that have been pretty fully explored in other fiction; yet another psycho bad guy that must be stopped at all costs; and cookie-cutter, jack-booted representatives of the government (in this case the cia).	1
	probably the most interesting aspect of the book is the description of various trivia regarding washington dc, including its architecture.	1
	if this book existed in isolation, i.e.	1
	if it were brown's first novel, i'd give it an average rating.	1
	but it's a disappointment after his previous books, particularly after waiting for it for 6 years.       	1
	nothing will be revealed.while the book does have a few good moments, and one surprising plot twist, overall it went nowhere.	1
	reading it i kept getting the feeling that it had no ending.	1
	i'm not sure dan brown even knew were he was going with his 'ancient mysteries', which seamed to change from one thing to another through the book as the characters kept changing their minds about what they were going to uncover.	1
	the book seemed to drone on, it was difficult to finish, and the end was very disappointing.	1
	the lost symbol uses the same formula of a&d;'s and the davinci code, and does manage to recreate some of the suspense of langdon's previous adventures.	1
	however, this time around the 'codes' were less believable, and it all just seemed like a waste of time.	1
	it just didn't live up to all the hype.      	1
	done with dan.caution spoiler alert:  what i discovered after reading the lost symbol by dan brown is: i'm done with dan brown books forever.	1
	the writing is such a formula that it matches the other books exactly.	1
	robert + studious girl + trusted friend + high level organization = dan brown book.	1
	this book took you 5 years to write?	1
	what did you do for the other 4 1/2 years?	1
	it's like reading a comic book for adults.	1
	every chapter ends with 'that's the most amazing thing i've ever seen' or 'i can't believe what i just heard' i was waiting for adjectives like wham, or bam, like in the old batman series.	1
	robert langdon constantly doesn't believe or think he can solve these codes?	1
	didn't he get a little confidence while being in the last 2 books?	1
	the books states things just for shock value that aren't true like: 'robert langdon is dead' i didn't think he really was because of how cheesy this book is.	1
	then he is still alive.	1
	when then he wasn't really dead was he?	1
	that happens a few times in the book.	1
	you lose credibly when you keep crying wolf.	1
	the one thing i find amazing about this book is that dan brown can lure millions of people into buying it, that is the real trick.	1
	i've seen better story writing in episodes of scooby doo.      	1
	a book/movie.i'm a bit disappointed that so many reviewers focused on comparative criticism, although it isn't too likely that many _lost symbol_ readers are reading brown's work for the first time.	1
	i did find the book almost impossible to put down thus finding brown a genius at motivational creativity.	1
	however, i did get lost in the minutiae occasionally.	1
	as i read, i could see the movie unfolding before my eyes.	1
	whether or not this was brown's intention is moot.	1
	as a recent, first time visitor to d.c., i am pleased to have visited so many key places and could refer to our travel photos to return there along with langdon et.al.	1
	i did correctly identify of the villain and the rationale.	1
	it is a stand-alone novel, and great fun.	1
	i find all of brown's work pure pleasure and quite compelling.      	1
	a disappointment.this lackluster effort by dan brown reminds me of the way that thomas harris followed up on the brilliant 'silence of the lambs' with the putrid 'hannibal'.	1
	it seems that brown tried to use essentially the same plot as the 'davinci code', just substituting names and some minor details.	1
	virtually every character type established in the code was represented again, but not nearly as well.	1
	in spots, 'the lost symbol' was mildly interesting but brown's stilted writing style was much more noticeable (and annoying) when conjoined with a lesser plot.	1
	lastly, it would be nice to see some continuity in the storyline from book to book.	1
	brown developed some very likable characters in 'code' and it would have been nice to see at least one make even a cameo appearance.	1
	in short, i found the book to be sub-par with a less than believable plotline.	1
	if you're expecting 'the davinci code' part ii, you'll be disappointed.      	1
	a major disappointment.i fell let down after enjoying davinci code and a&d.	1
	;   those were page turners.	1
	symbol was a real 'yawner!'	1
	in all honesty, i should have given up after the first 100 pages.	1
	sorry mr. brown!	1
	you've seen the last of my money.      	1
	dumb and dumber go to dc.had it not been for the 'puzzle,' i would have stopped reading this book before 100 pages.	1
	i had to see if what i figured out early on was the answer.	1
	the washington monument seemed too obvious.	1
	the early american masons must have had too much time on their hands if they went to all that trouble to hide their 'treasure.'	1
	to use the same device to create suspense at the end of almost every chapter is a bit much.	1
	if this book came with a money back guarantee, i would be $16.95 richer. 	1
	right down the middle.before i wrote this review, i looked at the spread of the star ratings over 1200+ reviews written.	1
	pretty evenly divided amongst all 5 possible ratings.	1
	and that sums up the book.	1
	i gave it a 3 star rating because it's neither terribly good nor terribly bad.	1
	to me, the story didn't move along quick enough and didn't make me want to keep reading.	1
	there was also one 'jump the shark' moment that upset me so much, i put the book down and didn't pick it up again for three days.	1
	lastly, i think brown rushed this to print.	1
	it seems to me that he had 75% of the plot ready and then made the last 25% up on the fly.	1
	(sorry didn't work for me).	1
	but if you enjoyed da vinci code and angels and demons, you will enjoy this book.      	1
	strange....i have read most of the 1 star reviews and actually agree with most of them, but i loved the book.	1
	maybe because i have read all of dan brown's other books and knew what to expect.	1
	there are times when you have to shake your head a little bit, and yes some of the 'twists' are so obvious that it is almost insulting...wait a minute, did i really love this book?	1
	basically this book has the same weaknesses as brown's other books.	1
	i rate it high because i had fun reading it overall and read it in about a quarter of the time i read other books.      	1
	the book is a waste of time..he can't write, as it seems now, although da vinci code was not that bad, really.	1
	in fact, this book is much worse.	1
	i'd say, save the money and get some ice cream -- guaranteed pleasure.      	1
	the lost symbol.so very boring.	1
	had to force myself to read it.	1
	will never buy any more of his garbage.      	1
	this one is a stinker!.i'm 150 pages from the conclusion and very disappointed in myself for not having abandoned this book long ago.	1
	it is a terrible sell-out for dan brown.	1
	borrow from the library if you must and do not spend your hard-earned dollars on this one.      	1
	an interesting and thoughtful read.i've read everyhting of dan's to date and typically love his stuff.	1
	especially davinci and angels.	1
	this book is no exception.	1
	really.	1
	i did like it.	1
	the negative is that it is somewhat cookie cutter and straight out of the other two books in terms of plot lines.	1
	a little too predictable.	1
	the positives are that it is a story based upon a very intersting subject - masonic lore.	1
	it also gives you plenty to think about in terms of how the subject matter applies to you ('me') as a person.	1
	i like that very much about dan's book and writing.	1
	i'd like to see him change up the plot line a bit when he comes out with his next book.      	1
	mr. langdon goes to washington.....fortunately for mr. smith when he went to washington, he didn't have to endure the fear, suspense, and agony that mr. robert langdon must.	1
	speaking of movies,  enjoyed box office numbers in part because of dan brown's humongous hit of a novel, .	1
	but instead of mining clues from european symbols in architecture and secretive organizations, it focused on washington d.c. and its freemason founders.	1
	now, dan brown ironically chooses the same location and the same masonic brotherhood as the basis for his newest robert langdon thriller, .	1
	national treasure was considered by many to be perhaps a rung below the da vinci code in terms of plot and general implementation of its idea.	1
	how then does the lost symbol measure up to the da vinci code?	1
	well, this reviewer would say that lightning did not strike twice.	1
	this novel doesn't cohere as naturally as did the da vinci code; at times the lost symbol gives the impression of being a bowl into which interesting but not necessarily connected research was tossed together.	1
	nevertheless, brown's latest packs enough of his trademark suspense, chilling violence, and brainteasing puzzles for fans to snap it up and devour it as fast as possible.	1
	here are a few specific examples of why the lost symbol doesn't quite live up to its wildly best-selling predecessor: the da vinci code revolved around a mystery that became very human (literally).	1
	the lost symbol doesn't quite go the same distance; although there is undeniable human drama for robert langdon and his friends, katherine and peter solomon, its core mystery (no spoiler here) remains more esoteric and more cerebral.	1
	this wouldn't necessarily be a demerit, but somehow brown's eagerness to fashion a mystery around the capitol's architecture and the supposed foundations of masonic beliefs, together with rather vague inclusions of noetic studies, near death experiences, decreased puzzle-solving, and other 'potpourri' of ingredients doesn't quite gel as successfully as his dazzling -- though not without much-bandied-about flaws -- fictional tale about searching for the holy grail.	1
	possibly, 'unmasking' masonry can't push the same buttons as when turning christianity on its head.	1
	brown also errs in the lost symbol by intimating the possible onset of a huge catastrophe if langdon and others cannot stop the central villain.	1
	the build-up suggests something truly earthshaking, but the revelation of the actual consequences turns out to be anticlimactic.	1
	and, as usual, brown infuses his fast-paced novel with some twists and turns, but most can be predicted by the reader in advance.	1
	perhaps brown intentionally structures his books thusly to make the readers feel smarter than hero langdon.	1
	if so, this is a double-edged sword because readers can judge the plot too obvious and beset with some howling instances of foreshadowing.	1
	interestingly, langdon, in the lost symbol, is often in the role of student rather than teacher.	1
	he does, assuredly, tap his vast knowledge of symbols at crucial times, but he, not being a mason, more often than not, accedes to others with more intimate understanding.	1
	in short, he appears more diffident, more secondary, in this novel than in the da vinci code.	1
	allegedly, some folks believed that the da vinci code was -- despite its claim to the contrary -- nonfiction.	1
	the lost symbol clearly states  before the story opens on which basic facts brown built to get this novel off the ground, but just as clearly the novel is just that, a novel.	1
	and due to its subject matter (masonry,etc.	1
	), fewer people will probably, at any point, wonder whether this thriller actually does reveal real secrets than did when devouring the previous blockbuster.	1
	this novel will provide solid hours of signature brown entertainment even if it doesn't cohere as naturally as did the da vinci code.	1
	just curiosity to find out what is happening to robert langdon now and how he might conquer his latest misadventure is reason enough to secure a copy of the lost symbol and decide for yourself how much you like it.	1
	and when the lost symbol is made into a movie, we can all compare it apples to apples to national treasure as well.	1
	while we're at it, it wouldn't hurt to catch  again either.	1
	:)       3.7 stars. 	1
	fast, intense, lots of fun.harvard professor and symbologist robert langdon has just finished a morning swim, has his coffee on, when he gets a phone call from his mentor peter solomon's assistant.	1
	solomon is wealthy, the head of the smithsonian institute and is a 33 degree mason, the top of the heap mason wise.	1
	he explains that solomon needs him to fill in for a speaker in washington who cancelled at the last minute.	1
	langdon agrees, meets solomon's private jet and flies to dc to give his speech, but when he arrives at the capitol there is no peter solomon, nobody there to hear his speech, however he does come upon peter's severed and recently tattooed hand pointing skyward.	1
	meanwhile a character named mal'akh, as sinister as any you'd find in literature, is stalking solomon's scientist sister katherine.	1
	katherine works in a secret lab set up in the bowls of the smithsonian.	1
	her field, noetic science.	1
	she's made tremendous breakthroughs in the field of mind over matter and the weight of the soul.	1
	she's going to change the course of human history.	1
	back to robert langdon.	1
	he gets a call from mal'akh.	1
	mal'akh has kidnapped peter and is responsible for that severed hand and the symbols tattooed on it.	1
	he want's langdon to follow symbolic clues that will lead to a secret that will be the source of a great power.	1
	langdon has no choice if he wants to ever see peter alive again.	1
	now throw in secret tunnels that run under the capitol, secrets of our forefathers, masonic secrets, more secrets than you can shake a stick at, then add in a ticking clock, langdon has a time limit if he wants to save his friend and lastly have langdon escape the clutches of the director of the cia's office of security, who wants the knowledge in langdon's head and who doesn't seem to care too much about whether peter solomon survives or not and you have quite a story shaping up.	1
	and shape up it does.	1
	dan brown certainly knows how to keep a reader clued to her chair.	1
	i read this book straight through, breathless all the way.	1
	langdon is a great character.	1
	mal'akh is a great villain.	1
	katherine is a great damsel in distress.	1
	this is a great thriller.	1
	review submitted by captain katie osborne      	1
	dan brown is heading down.much as i enjoyed 'the da vinci code' as a literal page turner, the same does not apply to the follow-up, brown's 'the lost symbol.'	1
	the story line is not as propulsive as in his earlier works, and the focus--or the macguffin--is not as clearly enunciated as in the previous stories.	1
	a useful plot twist energizes the last portion of the book but the journey is not quite worth the destination.	1
	no problem--brown will sell the story to hollywood, hanks will continue to walk through the role with a puzzled look and more bad hair.      	1
	it took 6 years to write this?.this is the most disappointing 'highly awaited' book i've ever read.	1
	i don't need to say anything else.      	1
	simpleminded.from rogue cia agents assaulting us citizens to mindless attempts to protect the world from the disatrous consequences of the revelation of ancient mysteries this manuscript screams incompetence.	1
	i am angry that i paid to read it.      	1
	two masonic thumbs up (one angry editor's thumb down).the lost symbol gets 4 stars for the story and rich use of masonic symbols, but only 3 stars for the actual writing.	1
	this should result in a total of 3.5 stars, but amazon does not allow 1/2 star ratings.	1
	so i decided to round down and apply a 3-star rating.	1
	much has been said about dan brown's poor writing technique in the previous two langdon stories, but in this outing brown really lowers the bar (he is, without a doubt, the poster child for 'tell, don't show').	1
	i'm sure the effect is quite jarring for someone working through page after page of the written word.	1
	fortunately, brown's verbose tendency to over-explain how a character, for example, delivers information through their eyes is not as bludgeoning in the audio version (even if you go with the unabridged audio).	1
	all that aside, the masonic plot combined with details about america and her founding fathers is entertaining and, to a certain point, almost inspiring.	1
	if readers complete the lost symbol and have a desire to learn more about washington, franklin, etc.	1
	and the city they built to serve the nation they founded, then i believe dan brown can be credited with a great service.       	1
	just didn't measure up..i read the first two robert langdon novels and thought they were great.	1
	i had no trouble getting buried in this book and loved it the whole way through but the ending left me thinking 'is that it?'	1
	wasn't disappointed until the end.	1
	i won't be recommending this book to many people.      	1
	the losing symbol.brown does it again!	1
	over and over!!	1
	same crazy amd ugly tattooed and sado-masochistic villain.	1
	good chases as usual, nice reversals in plot, but the novel feels like i have already read it.	1
	my neighbor volunteered the same insights.	1
	too much of the usual.	1
	gand      	1
	brilliant!.there are no words to describe the beauty of this book.... i absolutely loved the davinci code and mr. brown's analysis of the sacred feminine and its' suppression throughout history.	1
	so i thought he could never come close to writing anything more beautifully brilliant and truthful than that.	1
	but he proved me wrong with the lost symbol.	1
	because in the lost symbol, dan brown takes us yet another step higher on the ladder of truth, with the subject of enlightened mind, and truth, regarding the universal oneness of all relgion....all mixed in with his usual page-turning, suspenseful, good vs. evil, great storyline!	1
	also the location that mr. brown chose this time around for his tale, broadened the love and appreciation i already have for the land of my birth & the enlightened principles it was founded on....this book literally blew my mind!	1
	i would also venture to say, that considering the subjects mr. brown is choosing lately to mix in with his suspenseful tales....he has some very good karma coming to him!	1
	:-)  thank you so much for writing this book, mr. brown...it meant more to me than you could possibly know.       	1
	pulp but fun.the story is identical to his other books and the twist at the end is so predictable to be almost no twist at all.	1
	but dan brown does make you tun the pages and time flies by so purely as an entertainment it is worth the money.      	1
	the da vinci code in dc.an exact parallel to the da vinci code, nearly down to every single plot twist.        	1
	disappointing.after the long wait and much hype, i was very disappointed with dan brown.	1
	if you are looking for the excitement that kept you from putting down da vinci code, or angels and demons, you may be as let down as i was.	1
	yeah there was some good parts that kept me interested, but a little over half way through it turned boring and predicable.	1
	he ran on and on, but i stayed with it thinking something was going to happen but it never did.	1
	it is as if he was trying to fill pages.	1
	truly not worth the time.       	1
	a disappointment.i have found dan brown's previous works mildly entertaining, but this one barely kept me interested enough to care about the conclusion.	1
	dragged out beyond belief, and i found it really hard to believe that these returning characters could be this naive.	1
	felt like a very forced and inadequate sequel.	1
	lost interest.i didn't finish it because i completely lost interest in the how it turned out and what it all meant.	1
	and i only had a couple of chapters to go!        	1
	pandering to the church.this could have been a great book.	1
	but...he must have asked his intern write some long, out of place rants about how true the bible is.	1
	why justify the lack of clarity in the bible?	1
	didn't the press from the religious protestors help sell the previous books?      	1
	a good read.one of the more recent dan brown books that i've picked up.	1
	it was good, had some interesting moments but as a reader it pains me to say that i've read better by this author.      	1
	dan brown continues to shine.a great follow up to davinci code, the robert langdon series is easily the most entertaining action mysteries around.	1
	would definitely recommend, easy read which captures your imagination from page one.      	1
	awful..i had to force myself to finish it....i have read and enjoyed all other db books..this one was terrible....nothing but a bow to freemasonry and noetic 'science' - i use that term very loosely.	1
	i only finished the book because a friend recommended it.	1
	the characters are contrived..i can only think that he spat this out for the $$$.      	1
	forced.this book felt forced, and rather predictable.	1
	some of the associations it made required a good leap of faith.        	1
	terrible.too long, too preachy, and dharacters written poorly.	1
	ridiculously rapid recovery of the main characters after enormous physical and emotional ordeal just so they could wax rapturously about the potentional apotheosis of humankind.	1
	did no one wonder how psychotic madmen like the villain would fit into this rosy future?	1
	not worth the time it took to read!      	1
	review of the lost symbol by dan brown.the lost word is very good, and i enjoyed it alot.	1
	it was not as good as angels and demons and the davinci code, but better than digital fortess and deception point.	1
	as a mason, i was interested in seeing how accurately he portrayed rituals etc.	1
	given the descriptions, i would assume he is not a mason himself, but it was entertaining and interesting, nonetheless.      	1
	the lost author.we waited three or four years for dan brown to follow up the da vinci code.	1
	he should have quit while he was ahead, reputation relatively intact.	1
	this book is so bad, i feel cheated.	1
	time to go into retirement, dan.	1
	have fun investing your fortune, travel the world, join a monastic order or whatever turns you on.	1
	but please, no more of this rubbish.      	1
	a quite poor variation on an old theme.a nice story because it is set in washington, but with nothing really new, as far as the intrigue is concerned, compared to 'the da vinci code' or 'angels and demons'.	1
	some supposedly central elements of suspense are also easily predictable: it does not take long to suspect that mal'ach is zachary and that the spiral staircase under a big stone is the washington monument.	1
	as for the chapters following the death of mal'ach, they are as unnecessary and boring as the moralizing end of mozart's don giovanni.	1
	i wish langton had really died in his tank, so that the author would have been forced to re-invent himself in his next novel.	1
	by the way, concerning the power of minds on matter, one should read the iranian philosopher avicenna, who wrote very interesting pages about noetics,  1000 years ago, in his 'ishrt' and 'shif''.      	1
	worst book of 2009.what a major disappointment, this has to be the most boring book i've read in 2009. was the book meant to be a movie script?	1
	dan brown keeps perpetuating the same old story.	1
	if you've read his previous books, you already know the plot of 'the lost symbol'.	1
	don't waste your time!      	1
	another classic from dan brown.this book got the same astonishing twistist and same exiting puzzles & adventures as in every dan brown book.i really don't understand why people didn't like it and i think that no one can write this kind of book better than him.so, the idea of 'typical brown book' didn't bothered me at all, i rather call it 'another classic from dan brown'...buy it and enjoy it :)       	1
	beyond the fifth dimension.dan brown has become one of my favorite authors with two novels:  'the davinci code' and 'the lost symbol'.	1
	delving into the reasons and rituals behind secret societies, he reminds me of the ancient author homer,('the iliad' and 'the odyssey') whose unique blending of documented facts with his own improvised story line was one of the first to do so, and also served as some of the first literature i was exposed to.	1
	i'm impressed with this captivating, flawless style, the weaving of highly intricate plot material into such readable language; the ease of tracking the names and characters because of the interest each of them instantly provides the reader; and obvious meticulous research of actual facts enhanced by the fictional characters.	1
	both of these excellent novels are intellectually stimulating as well as being intensely captivating.	1
	i decided to read them well after they were written simply because, during an intense resurrection of dormant-since-high-school-enthusiasm with american history and the forefathers, i became more intrigued by the subject of free masons after discovering just how many of the forefathers belonged to the society.	1
	the limited research experience has changed almost every pre-conceived concept i held about them.	1
	their phrases and rituals are woven and used subconsciously throughout our own open societies, 'giving the third degree', being just one example of the influence noted.	1
	as you read, signs and symbols you never particularly dissected mentally before take on a whole new dimension.	1
	in a quick summary that is not intended to do the topics justice,  the main character, robert langdon, is an educator extraordinaire who specializes in the history of secret societies, covert coding and symbols that date back to early recorded histories, where persecution for free thought - or thought unsanctioned - drove the people, who deviated from the mainstream underground - most of them possessing genius.	1
	his research is widely respected and recognized as important, as is his common sense approach in the interpretation of it, making him a desirable contact when scholarly evaluation becomes necessary.	1
	however, it 'ain't easy bein' him',  he finds to his discomfiture - as he is thrust headlong into reliving the mysteries surrounding these secrets, their societies, and their symbolic structure.	1
	adding to the intrigue is the knowledge that most things seemingly are intertwined; across the ages, across cultures, protected by a chosen few who must prove their worth and their dedication.	1
	this is the underlying thread for both of the novels.	1
	both books have extensive reviews already assigned to them and little more of actual use to a prospective reader can be given; but in highly recommending both of them,  i also  enthusiastically rate both of them five stars and would rate them higher if the choice were mine.	1
	they are certainly out of the ordinary.      	1
	weak.i wish dan brown hadn't written this as a novel.	1
	i found the first half easy and interesting to read but the manner and style of his writing just bugs me.	1
	it's basically a research paper spouting his theories about the masons and linking different ancient texts and historical figures, but with annoying dialogue that's not written how people actually speak.	1
	his characters are speechifying everything they say, and he doesn't do a good job at all of veiling what he's trying to get across.	1
	conversationally it reminds me of an infomercial:  'but jane, does this vacuum pick up rocks as well as dust!?'	1
	'you bet paul!	1
	the sucker 2000 picks up rocks, dust, even rubble from my research lab that was blown up, destroying all my research into noetic science!'	1
	do yourself a favor and read some silas house instead.	1
	now there's a writer.      	1
	enjoyed the book.this was my first dan brown read.	1
	i decided not to start with the da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	i jumped right into the symbol.	1
	after the first chapter i could not put the book down.	1
	i live near washington, dc and have worked at signature flight support thus when hearing both mentioned i was smiling all over.	1
	the book does get a little wordy and preachy about symbols.	1
	the lecture stuff with students lost me.	1
	but overall the references to the ancient mysteries, the masons, and the twists of the final 5 chapters were good enough for me.	1
	i guess the noetic science stuff and the puzzle of symbols were the downside.	1
	the upside was the action, secrets of washington, dc, the twists and turns, the involvement of the cia and the shocking ending were pluses for me.	1
	like many of our esteemed reviewers pointed out if i had read the afore mentioned first books of mr. brown the symbol would be a let down.	1
	next stop will be angels and demons.	1
	then the main event 'the da vinci code.      	1
	entertaining, but not his best by a long shot..one probably shouldn't expect dan brown to ever top the the da vinci code, but even with unhindered expectations this 3rd langdon / symbology mystery-thriller is a bit of a snooze, although that's not due to a lack of setting and premise.	1
	those elements are as appealing as ever, more so since instead of the usual far-off locations and ancient history presented in both angels and demons and the da vinci code, here we have a locale and era much closer to home for americans:  none other than our own washington d.c., and the theory that america's history and her founding fathers are steeped in masonic lore and mystical secrets.	1
	when langdon is summoned by old friend peter solomon, a powerful washington figure as well as a modern-day mason, he thinks he's simply being called on to do one of the things he does best - lecture to a rapturous audience about symbology, which i find a fascinating subject all by itself.	1
	soon after arriving in d.c., however, langdon is yanked into the midst of a bizarre and sinister plot that threatens the security of the country and even the world, yadda yadda yadda.	1
	it's vintage dan brown with its lightning-fast pacing and cliffhanger chapter endings, chock full of interesting tidbits along the way to keep us interested, and we're much like the doomed children of hamelin as we follow brown's pied piper out of the village and into oblivion.	1
	where the story falters is in the characterization.	1
	it's never been brown's strength to begin with, and i don't know that his characters - including langdon, although he's slightly more compelling - are meant to be much more than tools to move the storyline along.	1
	still, we need something to sink our teeth into with these characters.	1
	brown's formula usually includes a bizarre, almost bond-esque villain who either wants something only langdon can deliver, be it knowledge or an actual object, or wants langdon out of the way so the criminal's evil deed can be fulfilled.	1
	the villain here, a physically and mentally freakish man we know only as mal'akh, is so two-dimensional and unrealistic that he struck me as a comic book character, and i thought he detracted from the value of the story rather than enhanced it.	1
	still not a bad book, and certainly an entertainer for the beach or other casual reading.	1
	where brown lacks in depth he makes up for with master craftsmanship in creativity and story structure, and his patent on the esoteric thriller is rock solid.    	1
	bland!!!	1
	!.i thoroughly enjoyed his other books, particularly angels and demons, however i found this book to be tedious and flat.	1
	it appeared that he was struggling for subject matter and just needed to fill the pages.	1
	there was no intrigue or any substance to it.	1
	a huge dissappointment!!!!	1
	advice: borrow it, don't spend the money on buying it.      	1
	get ready to roll your eyes, over and over and over again.from the ludicrous descriptions behind the history of the villain, to the section in which the main character is blindfolded, only to end up in the most obvious place in washington d.c., the author gives you plenty of opportunities to say 'aw, come on!'	1
	i hated the book, don't know what my husband and other see in it...	1
	quick thriller walks through wheezy sub-genre - no harm, no foul.dan brown's latest novel, 'the lost symbol,' proves that he is a victim of his own success.	1
	while treasure hunts have been thrilling readers for generations, brown virtually re-invented the sub-genre with his symbol-focused thrillers featuring robert langdon.	1
	thanks to his stratospheric success, this category of thrillers has been overplayed to death (think the history channel, recent nic cage movies, etc.).	1
	and yet we still buy this book in droves - brown's probably made $100 million since its release.	1
	what can you say about the plot?	1
	robert langdon, harvard prof and symbologist, is back and this time he's tracking down clues in washington d.c.  a demented madman has kidnapped langdon's friend and mentor, leaving a grisly trophy/clue behind in a very prominent dc landmark.	1
	we follow the usual langdon m.o.	1
	- nothing is as it appears at first; vital clues have been hidden in plain sight for the learned to decipher; and people dead for hundreds of years knew vastly more about human nature than we do today.	1
	look for short chapters, lots of italics, and a maddening number of chapters that end with one character making a shocked realization, only to lead into a chapter involving a parallel track of the novel.	1
	brown writes the perfect airplane book, and yet 'the lost symbol' seems to be more wheezy than thrilling.	1
	maybe it's because we've been here before - the names have changed a bit, but the song remains the same.	1
	all in all, a pedestrian effort by mr. brown that is sure to spark its own industry in symbol-related tourism to washington dc.      	1
	entertaining story.i am an avid reader and i read across many genres.	1
	although not a 'literary masterpiece' it is wonderfully entertaining!	1
	i thought it was fun to read and couldn't wait to find out what happened next.	1
	the villain in this story was terrific!	1
	i loved to hate him and that made it more fun to read.	1
	this book is a great 'vacation' read and i highly recommend it to  those that enjoyed the davinci code.	1
	did this book have some familiar tones to the davinci code?	1
	yes, but i didn't care because it was still very entertaining.	1
	worth the buy!      	1
	lost symbol: more of the same?.dan brown keeps his readers turning the page, but much slower in 'lost symbol.'	1
	brown's ideas are great, but re-using the same formula of the 'da vinci code,' and 'angels and demons,' causes a little bit of disappointment.	1
	brown provides many interesting facts in his books, because he does wonderful research.	1
	brown provides the reader with race-against-time thrillers, which are well thought out, but not brilliantly written.      	1
	edgy and full of history.this book i thought was an excellent follow up to the da vinci code.	1
	i was on the edge of my seat the entire book.	1
	dan brown's use of historical buildings and objects to create fictional stories is one of the most creative writing styles i have ever come across.      	1
	a quick read but not a good book..basically a rehash of the da vinci code, but not nearly as good.	1
	much in this book struck me as preposterous.	1
	the characters recover from terrible situations, and even mutilations, in a matter of minutes.	1
	the last 50 pages of the book are so slow i seriously considered not reading them.	1
	the only good thing is since i checked it out from the library i have no financial pain.      	1
	not as great as i expected.i am still trying to finish reading this book.	1
	i got it with such great expectations that it will be like the previous four dan brown books, but for some reason, it has not captured me as expected.      	1
	dan brown wrost book..by far, this is the worst dan brown book ever.	1
	far less than the first book.      	1
	formulaic.it is an interesting book and i've always be intrigued by this particular subject matter.	1
	however, dan brown has a formula and it is blatantly obvious which characters have translated over.	1
	if you like his writing you will like this book, but if you are a bit tired of the formula you can skip it and not feel like you've missed out on too much.          	1
	i just read my last dan brown novel.no character development, plot moves forward only through coincidence, a vehicle for brown`s pontificating and self-aggrandizement of his personal philosophies.	1
	where was the editor?	1
	book could have been half its length.	1
	a one-star rating is a gift.      	1
	formulaic.	1
	'formulaic' is pretty much it in a nutshell.	1
	brown has a profitable formula going for himself, but that's about all.	1
	'the da vinci code' really grabbed the public, but it was the second book about robert langdon's adventures.	1
	the first one, 'angels and demons' rode on the coat-tails of 'the da vinci code' success and 'the lost symbol' wouldn't be able to stand on its own either without brown's homerun w/ 'code.'	1
	no, brown is not a particularly good writer, but he knows how to crank out best-sellers based on what's already been successful and he has terrific people doing the marketing.	1
	in terms of 'awesome,' 'unpredictable,' and 'edge of your seat,' been there, done that with 'the da vinci code.'	1
	now, i'm just yawning .	1
	.	1
	.  	1
	forget it.i know he must have worked really hard to creat this work.	1
	but, it just goes on and on and on.	1
	maybe would have been a better short story,tom      	1
	decent mason apologia / story..this book comes off largely as pro mason apologia.	1
	there are some pretty interesting bits regarding the masons.	1
	especialy, as pertains to our founding fathers and the birth of america.the actual story wasn't his best but it wasn't bad either.       	1
	same story, new city..throughout most of the novel 'the lost symbol,' robert langdon questions what he is doing there.	1
	the reader can sympathasize.	1
	'the lost symbol' brings us back to robert langdon, the harvard professor and symbologist in washington dc searching for the lost word.	1
	ironically, it reads like the previous dan brown books.	1
	all in one day, a random series of connected events, a crazied madman thinking he can solve the worlds evils with his actions, the hard ass government authority figure seeming to be against langdon, the new security guard that does as he is told, the rich family that needs roberts help, and the smart girl who finds solace in robert and helps him along the way.	1
	it's the same book dan brown has recycled to a new city.	1
	it's a tired storyline and a disappointing addition to the robert langdon series, who quite frankly was just a bore in this novel.	1
	as robert ponders how he got into this mess, we wonder the same thing.	1
	how did we get ourselves into this mess of a book?	1
	save your money!      	1
	boring.this book irritates me on so many levels.	1
	firstly, robert langdon keeps going on and on about his disbelieve of the myth.	1
	i can't believe how many words or sentences are wasted on this.	1
	it's repetitive and doesn't serve any purpose to advance the plot or build the character.	1
	it's a waste of ink and paper.	1
	next, the villain is one-dimensional.	1
	yet again and again, so many words are wasted on describing how the villain tattoos himself.	1
	finally, the final plot twist is laughable.	1
	if you're a fan, you probably won't miss this book anyway.	1
	if you're neutral to dan brown's previous books like me, i'd suggest skipping this book.	1
	i wish i hadn't wasted my time.      	1
	lost symbol.i have read all of the previous dan brown offerings.	1
	da vinci code and angels and demons were outstanding.	1
	the lost symbol is almost as good at times - esp as relates to unraveling the 'mystery'.	1
	the evil villain is a give away rather early on and the location of the sought after treasure was a give away as soon as puzzle was presented.	1
	disappointing as a followup to da vinci and angels.	1
	if someone is just discovering brown it is an okay read.	1
	doesn't live up to the hype.      	1
	classic dan brown.dan brown's unique ability to wrap an exciting fictional story around both real and controversial historical events has not only made him a rich man, but has created a cottage industry for other authors and producers seeking to satisfy the enormous public interest in the subject matter discussed within his books.	1
	his latest book, 'the lost symbol', will surely stir up similar enthusiasm for historical investigation.	1
	set in and around washington, d.c., 'the lost symbol' once again embroils professor robert langdon in an action-packed thriller involving the united states capitol building, the free masons' role in founding this country, and a very, very scary villain.	1
	if you're a fan of dan brown's previous books, you'll no doubt love 'the lost symbol'.	1
	aside from being a pretty exciting story, it's filled with historical asides which make for interesting wikipedia reading.      	1
	hannibal vs. freemasonry.the first two thirds of the book i think i am reading a tom harris hannibal lechter type of book.	1
	story moves fast and is a page turner.	1
	seems as though the whole story is told over a 10 to 14 hour time period (better than '24').	1
	story has many twists and turns and is a good read on those dark and cold winter nights.	1
	i won't give away any of the surprises (you can read other reviews for that)but with all good suspense novels don't even try to guess where it is heading or who is who just enjoy the read if it is your cup of tea.	1
	there won't be many great revelations or some extraordinary ending but it is a good (not great) read.      	1
	same old routine.i wanted to like this book.	1
	really, i did.	1
	but i found it boring, formulaic and the writing style was very annoying.	1
	and i had it figured out about mid-way through; so much for suspense.	1
	how many lone lunatics are there running around in mr. brown's world anyway?	1
	and another peeve: after the first 20 pages or so we know who the characters are.	1
	he doesn't have to keep giving their full names every time he mentions them:  robert langdon said this, peter solomon did that.	1
	there's only one robert, one peter, one katherine.	1
	we should be on a first name basis by the end of the book.	1
	even if they don't have much personality.	1
	just an example of an irritating style. 	1
	good read but not the page-turner davinci was.some interesting concepts but at times it felt as if brown was simply trying to download all his research rather than advance the story with his information .	1
	i'd still recommend this book for an interesting, quick paced read.      	1
	dan brown feeling guilty about offending religion perhaps?.this book was not good.	1
	it had some elements that i did like, for example the origins of modern words and expressions and discussion of ancient symbols and their origins.	1
	but at the end of the day what this book was about was a bunch of people genuinely sympathetic to religion and the possibilty of esp like energies that link religion to science.	1
	sorry, but the faith healers out there at large are hoaksters plain and simple.	1
	there is no 'force' out there which they are channelling to turn cancer cells into healty cells.	1
	it's pure hoaksterism, or else why not just openly publish these miracle cures in medical journals, earning yourself a nobel prize while you're at it.	1
	ever notice that faith healers never cure somebody who has amputated limbs?	1
	it's always a disease that might have been easily faked on either the patient's sick side or on their 'cured' side.	1
	the book had entirely too much sympathy to the idea that the bible, etc... ancient manuscripts were actually works of science.	1
	that is simply not the case.	1
	i've seen people trying to find evidence of understanding of evolution in the bible, but it's pure fabrication because it's not there.	1
	i'm afraid with this book, dan brown has lost a reader.	1
	i did like the da vinci code, angels and demons, digital fortress, and deception point, but after this book, i can say firmly that i will never pick up another db book again.      	1
	this is a disaster.i really enjoyed angels and demons and the da vinci code but the lost symbol is a disaster.	1
	if this had been his first effort, it would never have been published.i can handle the writing style but feel that this story lacks substance and interest.	1
	without giving anything away, there are a couple of climactic moments that totally fizzled.	1
	the only reason i did not give this one star is that i enjoy the way he weaves history into his modern tales...just think this tale was forced and lacks interest.      	1
	lost symbol.the lost symbol by dan brown was an ejoyable read.	1
	the short chapters and action made the book easy to read without losing the story line.	1
	the book drew you in and was difficult to put down.	1
	i was sorry when i finished the book because i felt like it ended abruptly.      	1
	da vinci code was much better.this had the same feeling as the da vinci code, the way it was written and the way the story was structured.	1
	it felt like i was reading the same book, like it he took the cookie cutter mold of da vinci code and just cranked out another book, only this one had an ending that i thought was very disappointing, especially given all of the build-up.	1
	i was expecting something pretty amazing and at the end i just felt 'that was it??!!'.	1
	2 stars just for the effort, i guess.	1
	not worth buying, though.	1
	if you read the da vinci code and liked it then just pass on this one.	1
	disappointed for sure!	1
	though it did make me want to visit washington dc.	1
	if they could take whatever facts about the city are true and put it into a booklet, that'd be cool to take on a vacation to dc.      	1
	i am starting to enjoy reading.i have never really enjoyed reading and always went for the cliff notes vs reading the book when i was in school.	1
	i must say i have enjoyed reading dan brown's books and they have sparked an interest for me to start reading more.	1
	i am not going to disect this book like some reivews do as i would not know where to start.	1
	i will say the book was entertaining, kept my interest and i really enjoyed it.      	1
	disappointment in d.c..i was very disappointed.	1
	the writing is strong the story was weak.	1
	very few gripping scenes  tedious       	1
	predictable and a major dissapointment.after reading the davince code several years ago and could not wait for dan brown's next novel.	1
	the lost symbol is not nearly as good a novel as davince code was.	1
	first of all it is very predictable and secondly the basic concept or idea is terribly uninspired.	1
	the compelling ideas that were presented in the davince code are no where to be found in this novel.	1
	i suggest readers look elsewhere for something well written and inspiring to read and i also suggest that dan brown consider going back to stealing other people's ideas for his novels rather than try to come up with some on his own.	1
	a good place for him to start perhaps would be with a story about the large hadron collider.	1
	he could steel dr. nielsen and dr. ninomiya's paper about the god particle coming into the present from the future and damaging the collider to keep itself forever hidden.	1
	just an idea...      	1
	entertaining.classic dan brown.	1
	quite formulaic.	1
	but like all good formulaic mysteries it is entertaining, has some interesting information, fast moving, etc.	1
	by now he has likely started to read on the next group of mystics- he has christianity covered, now the masons, there are a few more groups to be written about.       	1
	good brown book.i like dan brown, this was good, not great, worth the read... great insight into the masons      	1
	creators and destroyers.i thoroughly enjoyed the read.	1
	i enjoyed the pacing, the detailed information of science and history, art and geography, and the overall story and theme.	1
	i don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to simply comment on one thing.	1
	there is a passage that states that some are creators and some are destroyers.	1
	that can always be seen in reviews on sites such as this where too many people feel the need to expound upon their pretentious opinions.	1
	everyone has an opinion and a great thing about art, books, and movies is that they spark thought and emotion in the people that view them.	1
	they cause us to think, be moved, and even inspire.	1
	some are simply there to entertain.	1
	just remember, it's much easier to be a destroyer and go around tearing down another's hard work than to be a creator and add something of your own to society.	1
	enjoy things for what they are, and don't take entertainment so seriously.        	1
	a waste of time.i've never written a review before but i felt compelled to comment on this book.	1
	the writing is dull and the plot is utterly absurd.	1
	i flipped through it as fast as i could just to get it over with.	1
	it's a stupid rehash of his two previous books, and they weren't worth revisiting.       	1
	waste of time & money.after reading a&d; and davinci i preordered this book...wish i had waited and read the reviews...a lot more entertaining...and i wouldn't have wasted the time it took to plow through this book.	1
	what a disappointment.      	1
	not a picky reader, but this book was awful.i'm not a picky reader, and i don't write fancy reviews, but this book may just be my least favorite book i've read in my life.	1
	robert langdon is one of the worst characters i've read and he drove me crazy.	1
	'think!'	1
	he's so 'intelligent' that it seems like he can't believe in anything.	1
	this was a terribly written book, and i read it quickly just to get it over with.      	1
	oh dan brown, don't preach to me anymore please.for starters, i really, really liked (95%) of this book.	1
	i couldn't read it fast enough (in a good way) and was reminded why mr. brown is an absolute joy to read.	1
	i read da vinci code years ago, and more recently picked up angels & demons (stay far away from the movies please!!!!!!!!!)	1
	loved a&d;, and so i was excited to receive this book by surprise and enter into mr. brown's world.	1
	i was reminded why i love reading him so much, as he constantly had me up until 1:30am saying, 'ok the next chapter is just two pages, one more chapter' which i started saying at 12am... his writing is wonderful and i really enjoyed the rollercoaster ride through washington, d.c. i was constantly trying to guess which side certain characters were on, and thought that his antagonist mal'akh was brilliant.	1
	unfortunately (at least for me this is a bit of a negative) i could see the plot twist coming about halfway through the book as to mal'akh's true identity and intentions...and maybe mr. brown wrote it that way (there is some allusion to this)...but for me this is a negative, albeit a forgivable one.	1
	so, up until now i loved this book to death and enjoyed reading almost every second of it.	1
	the negatives: the conclusion seemed a bit of a letdown given that it took 480 hardcover pages to get there, which is quite a lot of reading!	1
	i thought the finale was a bit rushed, but again was able to forgive mr. brown this because he is a fantastic writer.	1
	however, i had to force myself to skim the last 20-30 pages, which was terribly unfortunate.	1
	after the conclusion of course there is the matter of wrapping up what the lost symbol is.	1
	i found this to be horribly boring and terribly preachy, as mr. brown knew he had his readers and it was akin to saying 'i have you now, so let me ram my agenda in your face.)	1
	it wasn't religiously preachy, just...ideologically and theologically preachy...and boring.	1
	no mr. brown i don't really care about your world view and about how everything is united as evidenced by your main character's diatribes in the end of the book.	1
	while i appreciated that this book stayed away from being religiously preachy...i just couldn't handle the last 20 or so pages.	1
	utterly boring and unnecessary.	1
	mr. brown, i loved your book, but if it were perhaps 20-30 pages shorter, i would have been much happier and felt less cheated - and also this was the only time his agenda and viewpoints really shone through as people would expect.	1
	so, in sum, loved the book, hated the last 20-30 pages of it.	1
	if you're ok with that, and you should be, it's a great read that i would recommend, just don't tell anyone that the ending kind of stinks.      	1
	same story, different title..i will not be purchasing any more dan brown books.	1
	i was happy with his first 2 books but this one is very slow and boring.	1
	don't waste your money and time.      	1
	boring.what was his editor thinking?	1
	a hundred pages could have been cut from this book.      	1
	dan brown gives us a provocative - sometimes even an eye opening - perspective on familiar national objects & everyday phrases..critics abound that dismiss any and all books that they perceive as 'plot-driven' to be  undeserving as literature, and i fear many may likewise so dismiss dan brown's latest work - a gesture, alas, of shallow reasoning that would be both myopic and a disservice.	1
	to use a phrase seminal in the lost symbol, such analysis would be `unworthy'.	1
	one can read this book on its immediate thriller level and enjoy a fast-paced tale, filled with the latest techno tools; however the plot is not what it's all about... dan brown loves connections and coincidents for the joy of enrichment and wonder they bring to his active mind and probing soul, and that joy and excitement blazes across the pages to torch his readers as well.	1
	in the lost symbol professor robert langdon is forced into solving an ancient freemasonry mystery with nearly impossible deadlines to hopefully save the life of a close friend, and possibly many others.	1
	intertwined through the breathtaking action, brown relates profound ideas - ideas he demonstrates as being there right along, hidden in the great religious writings across the ages - great and philosophical thoughts woven into the mesh of a chilling murder and extortion plot.	1
	and along the way we learn amazing facts about our national capital.	1
	if it takes a `plot' and a dash of mysticism to prod one's further thinking along spiritual and philosophical lines - then why not?	1
	this is a well researched book, one ably thought out and amazingly constructed.	1
	one truly rewarding to read.	1
	worthy on a number of levels -   and, yes, literature.	1
	i just couldn't buy into it..with all of dan brown's other novels, i was willing to suspend disbelief because of the careful background research.	1
	the reasons he gave for the motivations of his characters and the tangle of mystery just weren't believable this time.	1
	this read more like a csi crime drama than an adventure.	1
	i kept hoping for some neat revelation or ending, but it was disappointing.	1
	the secrets revealed aren't secret at all.      	1
	entertainment.i read books like this for fun and entertainment.	1
	i was very entertained!	1
	i have read all of brown's books and i must say i found them all highly entertaining.	1
	if you want to analyze and tear them apart, have at it.	1
	if you want to have a good time turning pages to find out what happens next, i find that makes the book much more worth the money.	1
	unless you're a world renowned, best selling author i think it's rather presumptuous to offer dan brown advice on writing, but then that's just me.	1
	if nothing else, brown's latest offering makes me want to spend some time in d.c. site seeing.	1
	it also makes me want to read the bible again, but from a different perspective.	1
	i may even have to buy some other books on religion.	1
	it's a novel, and a damn good one.	1
	money well spent.      	1
	read his other books but skip this one.by far the worst of all brown's books.	1
	i loved the other four, but this one really sucked.	1
	time for robert langdon to retire.      	1
	disappointing ....i'd rather read da vinci code for the second time.	1
	waste of time and money ; waste of memory space on the kindle.       	1
	the lost symbol: signifying very little.[...]	1
	first and foremost, here's the answer to the question everyone seems to want to know:  no, the lost symbol is not as good as the da vinci code.	1
	now, down to business: in the interest of full disclosure, i was predisposed not to like this book, because dan brown's writing irritates me.	1
	still, i tried to give the book as much of a chance as possible.	1
	i know the lost symbol isn't war and peace, so i tried it enjoy it for what it is: a best-selling thriller.	1
	i did my best.	1
	i really did.	1
	i suspended disbelief.	1
	i ignored the obvious plot holes...the architect of the capitol doesn't have a key to the front door?	1
	i looked past the annoying italics peppered throughout every page, which are supposed to reveal characters' dramatic inner thoughts, but really just jar you out of the narrative.	1
	i even ignored the false-drama cliffhangers at the end of each chapter.	1
	(but when a dumb cliffhanger and an italicized thought were combined, i couldn't help but laugh out loud -- eg.	1
	katherine's destiny is to light this torch.	1
	mine is to destroy it.)	1
	i really tried to enjoy it.	1
	i promise.	1
	if you can get past all those faults, i suppose the story itself isn't terrible.	1
	now-famous symbologist robert langdon speeds around washington, d.c., deciphering encoded message after encoded message, hoping to save his friend peter and stop a madman from revealing the ancient mysteries kept secret by the masons for centuries.	1
	all the while, langdon (and brown) are constantly inserting little-known facts about various d.c. landmarks, as well as history, philosophy and religion.	1
	for instance, do you know the meaning of the apotheosis of washington (pictured above -- click on the image for a larger view), which is painted on the ceiling of the us capitol dome?	1
	that explanation is at the heart of brown's point for the novel, so i won't spoil it here.	1
	but even with all of brown's historical hmmmms, it still didn't feel like the lost symbol delivered the same level of drama and intrigue as the da vinci code.	1
	maybe that's because i was more prepared to be skeptical this time, and i kept asking myself, 'is that really true?'	1
	and that was the biggest problem for me -- i never trusted brown to lead me through the story to a satisfying payoff.	1
	trust is such an enormous part of the unwritten reader-writer contract -- trust that you are in safe hands and the set-up and rising action will ultimately lead to a denouement that makes the time spent getting there worthwhile.	1
	because of the clunky plotting and cliched writing, i expected to be let down at the end, so i never fully invested myself in the story.	1
	and so there was never a moment when i put down the book and thought, 'wow, i'm really enjoying this novel.'	1
	that said, i have to admit, there is a payoff at the end.	1
	a cool twist, as well as a fairly interesting lesson in philosophy make the last 100 pages or so pretty enjoyable.	1
	but i didn't even realize i was enjoying them until the book was over and i was once again rolling my eyes at the cheesy last line.       	1
	another great one from dan brown.many of us enjoy reading a good book for escapism.	1
	we look for a book with a good plot, a 'who done it' that we can't figure out until the last minute, a book with a secret where the good guys are people like us or our friends (or at least what we would like to be seen as.)	1
	we like books where the bad guys are the opposite of us, those folks who do things we could never even dream of doing.	1
	but dan brown's 'the lost symbol' isn't just a good book, it's a great book.	1
	in this book, brown raises some questions that make us a little uncomfortable.	1
	do we ever know those around us as they really are?	1
	are they putting on an act just for us?	1
	dan brown's 'bad guy' is just that kind of person that many people had complete faith in, assuming him to be the 'right kind' of man.	1
	he was trusted with masonic secrets but in reality was anything but a person to be trusted.	1
	now let's talk about the 'good guys.'	1
	robert langdon from 'the da vinci code' is back in this book, still reading the codes.	1
	he then draws on his expertise in ancient codes and symbols so that sometimes he is able to understand what others have seen for years and never deciphered.	1
	other times robert has to be helped along by keepers of the secrets (or of only one part of the secret.)	1
	speaking of secrets, dan uses the biggest keeper of secrets, the masons, to tie everything together.	1
	this book took me back to eighth grade where my love of mathematics prompted me to join the math club where we tried to solve various types of codes.	1
	once you became a good code breaker the messages were easy to read.	1
	it all depended on logic, observation and sometimes just luck.	1
	dan has this in the book but at the genius level and codes that have been around for thousands of years - codes within codes - secrets within secrets.	1
	wow!	1
	the setting for the book is washington d. c.  i've never been there, but even before reading this book i had it listed as a place that i would like to visit someday.	1
	now i want to read the book again with pen and paper, making a list of all the places that dan writes about with their obvious purpose and then with their hidden agenda.	1
	if half the people who read this book start making travel plans to visit dc in the next two years and carry them out, dc certainly won't need a stimulus package.	1
	dan's book is fast paced taking place in only ten hours for the main body of action.	1
	it's been a long time since i have read a book with this much taking place in this short of a time span.	1
	you won't want to put the book down even when it is over.	1
	make sure you have a couple of days to put aside for just you and pure enjoyment.	1
	les k..i found it difficult to put the book down expecially since i worked and lived in the washington area for 30 years before retiring to nebraska.	1
	as a result, i knew almost all the landmarks, residential areas, streets, and parks mentioned in the book.	1
	and to top it off, i lived close to the masonic temple in alexandria, va on the blue/yellow subway line !!!	1
	i rate this book outstanding and i can see why it took dan brown 5 years to research and write this convoluted book.	1
	thanks you.	1
	les      	1
	the lost symbols - dan brown.i think this book is such a failure.	1
	i dont know what i was hoping for, but this is definitely not it... i believe there is so much more of the history and the details behind the free mason thing.	1
	but somehow dan missed it.... so disappointed...      	1
	not even close to originality of da vinci code.plus really disappointing ending.	1
	this book is just formula writing cashing in on prior success.	1
	give us something really new dan.      	1
	a wasted opportunity.perhaps this was my wasted opportunity to read something else.	1
	mr. brown is being slammed for being a poor writer.	1
	i am not a writer and therefore not qualified to critique his style, but his topic and his main characters were tedious and annoying.	1
	professor langdon (the da vinci code) chases around europe with a member of the french police, searching for the holy grail, ultimately the blood relative of christ.	1
	he is convinced by the historical log of the keepers of records.	1
	he's okay with this.	1
	next professor langdon (angels and demons) chases above and below the streets of st. peter's seeking antimatter, set to destroy the basilica.	1
	he's okay with that.	1
	finally professor langdon (the lost symbol) is in d.c., and totally adamant against anything proposed by any number of professional persons engaged in masonic rites and politics.	1
	'it just cannot be so!'	1
	'it is just impossible!'	1
	'it is just a myth!'	1
	(i really got tired of his denials.)	1
	i had the feeling that professor langdon had gotten dumber by the book and that now, as he refers to his classes and students, he might be teaching the remedial classes at harvard.	1
	give me a break.      	1
	extremely disappointed.i am a huge dan brown fan however, i did not like this book at all.	1
	there was no mystery.	1
	it was very predictable and it made me angry that i had to read nearly 500 pages to read what i had figured out in the first few chapters.	1
	i kept telling myself, 'it can not be this obvious' and yet it was.	1
	i loved his previous books, all of them, but this one did not leave me wanting me more.	1
	sorry dan!      	1
	i couldn't believe the ending.i felt like hours of my time were wasted when i read the ending of this book.	1
	people died in the story line for such an obvious non secret - really, is there nothing else for dan brown to write about than perhaps he should take a break from writing!	1
	what a disappointment.      	1
	luke warm.this is my fourth dan brown book and it can't compare to angels & demons.	1
	i didn't have any trouble putting this book down and coming back to it later.	1
	the characters are very superficial and the story plot is much too simple and predictable.	1
	it is just blahhhh!       	1
	downhill fast @ chapter 122.quite an exciting read until it hits the wall at chapter 122 and then it becomes pure drudgery for the remaining 50 pages.      	1
	another great novel by dan brown.the lost symbol is another masterfully written novel by dan brown.	1
	not only does it contain all of the suspense, factual reference, and conspiracy theory that one would expect from dan brown, but this time he throws in some unusual twists that will prevent you from ever putting it down.	1
	if i had to really nitpick and point out negatives, i would probably say that the story contains a few (a very few) predictable outcomes; brown's writing contains the usual editorial errors; and the ending isn't exactly mind blowing by any means.	1
	all in all, however, there are many more positives than negatives, and any reader who enjoys an involved story and an elaborate plot will enjoy reading this book.      	1
	i'm torn....i'm torn between writing a raving review for dan brown's latest, and letting out my disappointment for this highly-anticipated book.	1
	on the one hand i'm a fan of brown's.	1
	i've read all his book and not one has let me down.	1
	they're not literary phenomenons, but the story makes up for what the writing lacks.	1
	on the other hand, i must admit that i had expected mor from the lost symbol.	1
	early on i knew what one of the clues were, and found it unlikely that robert langdon didn't.	1
	at the same time i did enjoy brown's fast-paced plot, intriguing storyline and fascinating characters.	1
	not as good as the davinci code, but a very good read!      	1
	the same old.it's a formula, it's a formula.	1
	nasty improbable bad guys, good smart doctor, silly codes that i knew in fifth grade.	1
	washington dc scenery and wow the masons a secret society.	1
	fast reading but it's the same plot for the third time.        	1
	amazon gave symbol 5 stars?.i gave symbol two stars because of weak science, two dimensional characters, and a feeling i hade read the book previously ( similarity to davinci code).	1
	however, if you google 'lost symbol', you get the following result as the lead for the amazon site:  'the lost symbol (9780385504225): dan brown: books5.0 out of 5 stars the lost symbol review'  where is amazon coming from on this?  	1
	the history you will not learn in school.dan brown grasps the reader by the first chapter and does not let go until this enlightening and wild ride back into the mysterious past of american founding fathers and masonry is finally concluded in his last chapter.	1
	it is for the skeptic, the believer, the conspiracy theorist, and for those who want to be entertained.	1
	one can not help but be in awe of brown's research and literary genious.	1
	this story is sure to be one that will last and cause quite a stir.	1
	read this book!      	1
	thoroughly enjoyable!.boy did i get sucked into this book.	1
	sure, there are some implausible things going on in the story but hey, isn't that why they call it fiction?	1
	i am a very avid reader of many genres and a writer as well so i can very often predict the plot path of a story.	1
	however, dan brown snuck up on me several times in this one which made the book all the more enjoyable.	1
	i'm sure part of the reason that this book was appealing to me is that i am so interested in washington d.c.  it will be fun to look up some of the locations when i return to d.c. in the fall.	1
	for those who were derisive about this book and implying that it was inferior work and 'all about the money' for dan brown and his publisher i'd like to offer that perhaps the detractors are simply jealous of previous and current successes.	1
	any book that keeps me reading until 2:00 a.m. two nights in a row is worth the money.      	1
	florida lady's opinion.the book started off at a brisk pace and kept me totally interested.	1
	somewhere along the way it got too convoluted and went off in all directions until you were almost dizzy.	1
	it became too bizarre , especially the weird tatooed protagonist.	1
	enough is enough, mr. brown.      	1
	screaming.	1
	piece.	1
	of.	1
	garbage..4 words: screaming.	1
	piece.	1
	of.	1
	garbage.	1
	glad i got it for free from someone else and i could skim this junk.	1
	he writes like a pulp fiction author- obvious cliffhangers, leaving out details to overtly make you 'want' to continue .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	it's like it was written for a 9th grader.	1
	then there's the subject matter, claiming scientific 'fact' for concepts that are purely conjecture and the lore of pulpit bible-thumpers.	1
	please consider this as a review for dan brown's 'the lost symbol'- it should stay lost.      	1
	don't bother.i could barely finish this dull, boring book.	1
	it is just a watered down version of davinci code, set in a new location.      	1
	how do you beat the da vinci code - well the lost symbol comes close..first off.	1
	i won't give anything away in this review.	1
	what a great adventure.	1
	fantastic book from cover to cover.	1
	the only problem: how can any langdon adventure ever beat the da vinci code.	1
	it simply can't just because it was such a fantastic blend of a brain roller coaster and thriller.	1
	the lost symbol is close but not quite there.	1
	brain stimulating wise it offers almost as much - but how can you beat how we forever view 'the last supper'... ok to my review:  as a big fan of early american history and the great city of washington dc it was a pleasure to read.	1
	also loved the kudos to the ancient world and especially the ancient appreciation for the brain.	1
	(the only super computer of the time - makes sense why they had such a interest in the brain - and how we today may sometimes overlook it) the spiritual conclusion in the book is just out of this world and could and should spark a new 'religion'.	1
	(like we need one more) a very open, non denominational self empowering spiritual 'following'.	1
	sign me up!!	1
	dan brown i thank you.	1
	as 'a creative' myself i know it must be frustrating for you to know how hard it will be to ever beat the da vinci code's success.	1
	keep trying - i will read everything you'll write.	1
	i would also like to read a book about your seemingly fantastic and open views on spirituality and higher powers, in a non thriller (non-fiction) format.	1
	a related comment to the langdon series: i wish the movies would have been better of both da vinci code and angels & demons .	1
	what dan brown gives us via his intellectual observations and insightful writing seemingly can't be translated to film.	1
	so far it's dan brown 2 hollywood 0. here's a challenge to european/international film makers: please try to cut a deal with whomever holds the movie rights and give it a go.	1
	italian, swedish, british, french, czech... perhaps the less commercial and more serious style of foreign films would suite the subject matters and the intellectual content better.	1
	this way a larger audience would be introduced properly to dan brown's magnificent work.	1
	(i am sure that the last two films have disappointed both book fans and potential dan brown readers) i am not holding my breath for the lost symbol movie...but i will probably go and see it, just for the 'cheap' cinematic visit to washington dc. 	1
	the lost sequel.the lost symbol is the perfect example of a failed sequel to a blockbuster success.      	1
	pedantic college lecture.i am so sorry i wasted my time and money on this book.	1
	i thought the author cranked out an overly pedantic lecture on masonic mysticism interrupted by a trite story line.	1
	i did appreciate the vicarious tour of washington dc .      	1
	overall not a stellar performance.certain parts were much better than the da vinci code, but overall it was not as good.	1
	the book is fiction, yet i kept feeling brown was trying to pass certain parts of it off as non-fiction.	1
	that turned me off.      	1
	good story - not as good as previous.this was still a good story but i did not find it as well written as da vinci or angels and demons for that matter.      	1
	disappointing.brown has gone overboard.	1
	very little research, fabricated facts, he has completely lost credibility as a history novel author.	1
	it is a shame.i was truly disapointed, to the point i will not read him anymore, and i liked all his other books.      	1
	a dan brown page turner.after reading all of dan brown's books, this one fits the mold.	1
	a fun page turner with little substnnce.	1
	the ending was a real let down.	1
	i found the last few pages very difficult to get thorugh.	1
	honestly, there are better books to read.        	1
	hmmm?.	1
	i kept wanting to like it , kept hoping for the big reveal, kept hoping langdon would get wiser, but i was so disappointed with this book.	1
	i loved the first 2, and was waiting a long time on this only to be let down.      	1
	disappointing.i loved his previous work, but this was formulaic and predictable and the ending (the big secret) is ridiculous.      	1
	mozart all over again.the only thing missing when i opened the cover of dan mason'smasonic thriller is the glorious music from the magic flute bymozart also about freemasonry.	1
	however, the book with it's three pronged plot makes the trials of tanino and pamina almost one-dimensional first we meet mala'kh,a thirty three degree mason covered withtatoos and pancake makeup.evil exudes from brown's depiction of this arch villain.	1
	second we are re-aquainted with professor/detective robert langdon mysteriously summoned to washington,d.c..there in themiddle of the u.s. capitol rotunda he comes across a severed hand.upon close examination he concludes that it is the hand of hismissing friend, peter soolomon.	1
	the hand has been skewered to a spike and is covered with arcane tatoos indicating that it is the hand of the mysteries' wich points to secrets held by ancientsorcererd and scientists.	1
	while langdon combs the capitol basement accompanied by sato, the wizened and hard-boiled female director of the ciaa modern day 'tokyo rose'  while all this is going on katherine,peter solomon's sister iswringing her hands in fear of what has happened to her brotherwhile out in the secrecy of her smithsonian research lab.	1
	'malakh' sneaks up on her, drowns her assistant in a tun ofethyl alcohol in the company of a giant squid.	1
	up to this point the lost symbol is a technineolgical thrillerbut dan brown's sensitivity and metaphysical side start to come intoplay.	1
	one of my favorite parts takes place at the national cathedral;mt st alban's, massaachusetts avenue.	1
	my husband and i were marriedthere in the bethlehem chapel (lower level) by a canon of thecathedral 47 years ago and our son was baptized in the children'sroom with its mural depicting biblical scenes on the main floor.dean galloway is the wizened blind prelate who gives katherineand robert 'sanctuary' if only temporarily.the wicked action startsup again;but me,being a linguist is quite taken with somethingdan brown teaches us: it seems that robert has been carrying a smallmasonic pyramid and gold capstone in his bag.	1
	very odd symbolsin a grid are scratched upon these items.	1
	robert boils them,why?they are covered with protective wax.	1
	in latin wax is 'cera''sine' means without'.	1
	the professor wants to remove the wax thebetter to decipher the real thing.	1
	'sine cera'='sincere' a wordwe use every day from the latin 'free of wax' how cool is that?	1
	summing up, as a roman catholic i dreaded reading a booksupposedly about freemasonry.	1
	did it mock my church?	1
	far from itin the last chapter a modern day resurrection takes place, weirdbut no weirder than living after being nailed to a cross.	1
	this book can touch every fiber of everyone's heart and soulit did mine.	1
	by nina lockwood  ([...])      	1
	lost symbol.i just finished reading the 'lost symbol' and i have to say, this book is nothing like 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons'.	1
	it was hard to get into, so many repetitions and i was glad when i was done.	1
	it was a bore compared to the other two books.	1
	i truly struggled to get through it,      	1
	nail biter.i read a few reviews before reading this book and noticed a pattern.	1
	if you've read dan brown's other books, you didn't like this one.	1
	lucky for me this is the first dan brown book i've read and i loved it!	1
	it kept me on the edge of my seat and i didn't want to put the book down.	1
	i finished it within three days.	1
	and because of all of the other reviews i've read, i know now that when i read the da vinci code and angels and deamons that i won't be disappointed.        	1
	here we go again with conspiracies.predictable, reads like a one hour tv mystery show.	1
	reminded me of college initiations and tales told around a campfire of things that go bump in the night.      	1
	overwrought.brown's language is cliche and overwrought, and there's a disappointing pay-off at the end.	1
	the attempted reconciliation of science and religion is tiresome -- it's been done and overdone.	1
	as ever, it's only interesting for as long as the science remains mysterious.        	1
	falls short of previous dan brown books.the davinci code and angels and demons are dan's best.	1
	this book, while good, requires much foreknowledge of free masons and symbols etc.	1
	i have read extensively on these subjects so was able to follow the written word.	1
	however, i do feel that the conclusion 'came out of left field'.	1
	i still would recommend it as a good read.      	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown.another triller from that master of suspense dan brown as this time his harvard symbologist robert langdon is called to washington, d. c. and soon realizes he's not only been tricked, but is plunged into a deadly series of events.	1
	confronted with strange symbols and codes he must somehow decipher if he is to rescue his dear friend and mentor peter solomon, a millionaire and prominent mason, who's been kidnapped and brutally maimed, he also knows he must fight to save his own life.	1
	as langdon struggles to uncover the mysteries and solve the secret of a long-lost wisdom and incontestable truth, the reader is taken on a breathtaking journey across our nation's capital and into the hidden places of some of its most important buildings.	1
	it's a fascinating journey with many twists and turns and a really scarey tatooed villian whose real identity came as a complete surprise to me.      	1
	a bit disappointed.dan brown keeps you interested all the way through.	1
	his action is not stop.however, the ending was a bit disappointing from my point of view.i guess i was expecting more.      	1
	entertaining & informative.the lost symbol was fun to read.	1
	i had always wanted to know more about the mason's, and i have not had much time in dc.	1
	so, i think i learned a little bit about both, and found myself doing some online research as i read along.	1
	the story is ok, suspenseful, and sufficiently scary to keep your interest.	1
	if there is to be a movie, they will need someone like a hopkins to portray the lecter like character of intelligent evil.	1
	will this book change your life?	1
	not likely.	1
	is it a quick fun read?	1
	yes.      	1
	good start and middle... then a drastic downfall.had promise, entertaining page turner, and then... it all went to hell in a handbasket.       	1
	dan brown meets david o. selznick.	1
	late in life, david o. selznick would complain that after he made gone with the wind (1939), every picture he did was compared to gwtw and, of course, none of them measured up.	1
	so i wasn't expecting another mega hit like the da vinci code.	1
	but i was expecting something insanely inventive, like the da vinci code or deception point, and that's what i got.	1
	accordingly, my rating for the lost symbol is based on the merits of this novel standing on its own.	1
	that said, the lost symbol's plot structure is bizarrely similar to tdvc.	1
	when i first started noticing the parallels (which didn't take long) i felt annoyed.	1
	i feared that since dan brown had hit a home run with the plot structure in tdvc, he had simply made a cookie cutter copy in tls.	1
	but then i got into the flow of tls and found it simply amusing to spot the parallels.	1
	a few of the more obvious parallels: 1) tdvc featured a special number, 1.618 (phi).	1
	tls features a special number, 33.2) tdvc decoded secrets with poetry in iambic pentameter.	1
	tls decodes secrets with numbers in magic squares (by albrecht drer and benjamin franklin).3) tdvc featured a bizarre character driven to kill by the greed of others.	1
	tls features a bizarre character driven to kill by his own greed.	1
	but as i said, finding the parallels serves only as an amusement.	1
	what matters is that the story moves right along and constantly introduces us to aspects of history that they somehow forgot to tell us about in high school, such as the ascension of george washington to godlike status.	1
	i also liked the insights into the freemasons.	1
	if i had known about this group in my younger days i would have been seriously interested in joining them.	1
	what i didn't like so much was the over-the-top stuff, such as noetic science and the description of a new high-tech way to torture people.	1
	but as the saying goes, you don't know how much is enough until you know how much is too much.	1
	overall, an excellent read.	1
	there just isn't anyone else who can come up with arcane historical and technical material and weave it into a thriller like dan brown.	1
	thanks, dan.	1
	ps - if you have any interest at all in things mathematical (and mine is marginal), you'll want to check out drer's amazing magic square.	1
	how did anyone ever come up with something like this?	1
	how is this even possible?	1
	see the 'albrecht drer's magic square' segment in the wikipedia article at [...]  	1
	the lost symbol.this book was a good book, and was very interesting.	1
	it is not as good as angels and demons or the da vinci code, the two books that came before it, but it is still a thrilling read and would be suggested to people who like to read, especially people who like thrillers or is a fan of dan brown.	1
	the biggest disappointment was that the ending wasn't as dramatic as the book promised (comparable to the ending of rick riordan's percy jackson and the olympian series: the last olympian).       	1
	the lost symbol.for almost 500 pages i was enjoying the story and looking toward the climax.	1
	very disappointing last 30 or so pages - boring.	1
	probably won't go back to dan brown again.      	1
	a decent read!.this is not as good as probably angels and demons or the da vinci code but is an improvement from brown's deception point and digtal fortress duo.	1
	the storyline is more or less predictable and follows the same pattern as rest of his novels.	1
	the clues are easily deciphered even with out extensive knowledge of freemason history.	1
	the clues end up being primary school stuffs and do not force the same kind of reaction as angels and demons or da vinci code.	1
	the narration is more like a movie script than a book...which is good in one sence but does not provide the thrill the way a book should.	1
	overall a decent timepass read and probably dan brown's 3rd best publication by a long way.      	1
	sato.one thing that really bothered me about the book was dan brown constantly referring to sato's 'little eyes'.	1
	i almost was waiting for the words, 'little slated eyes'.	1
	don't forget mentioning of little asian boy who is from tibet as well.        	1
	wait until the movie comes out.dan brown is getting lazy.	1
	i loved angels and demons and was amused by the da vinci code but this book should have been under a different author's name.	1
	the movie will certainly be entertaining and probably cheaper than buying the hard cover of this book.      	1
	extraordinary new book!.this new dan brown book was just wonderful.	1
	i was on the edge of my seat for much of it and was very impressed with the historical background.	1
	i learned a lot about the masons and about washington, dc.	1
	i have read all the dan brown books and his writing just gets better and better.	1
	i can't wait for his next book and would highly recommend all of his books!      	1
	the lost symbol.dan brown has written a novel in a similar vein to angels and demons and devinci code, with an unexpected twist at the end.	1
	it has lots of symbology and twists and turns to keep the reader engaged.	1
	i liked this book better than devinci code, but not as well as angels and demons.	1
	the book has a healthy dose of dan brown's philosophy about life which is in your face too often.	1
	all in all it was an excellent read.      	1
	a let down.having read brown's previous work, i have to say this was a bit of a disappointment.      	1
	freemasonry and human enlightenment.i have to declare from the onset that i am a freemason.	1
	this book is therefore of interest to me.	1
	having read the book over two weekends i have to say that i am impressed with brown's intellectual bandwidth as it relates to his knowledge of the esoteric.	1
	any author who can reference the works of bro.	1
	manly p. hall, alesteir crowley and sir francis bacon ( brown seemed to be particularly impressed with bacon)  has done his background reading.	1
	i would love to tour brown's personal libray.	1
	brown's portrayal of masonry as comprising honourable men like the book's 33 degree masons peter solomon and warren bellamy is indeed accurate.	1
	the central theme of the book is that man has not realized his full potential and can do so through tapping into lost knowledge that is contained / encrypted in the higher degrees of masonry and is also being unwraveled by noetic science.       	1
	same story, different names.it's not as good as the davinci code.	1
	it proceeds with the same style, a similar plotline, very familiar characters, and not much momentum.      	1
	ran out of steam at the end.the 'lost symbol' was a real page turner up thru about chapter 90 and then turned rather dull with no apparent end in sight.      	1
	it's okay.i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	i like this the least.	1
	his books are becoming almost predictable.      	1
	eeew.i soldiered on till the end, but what a waste of time and paper.	1
	note to dan brown - must do better      	1
	what a waste.i am not going to go into great detail over my displeasure of this book.	1
	i would like to recommend that you not waste your time reading this.	1
	there are many great books out there, and this is not one of them.      	1
	rambling.get to the point dan brown.	1
	this book just rambles.	1
	while the story has some interesting twists, it could easily been told in 30% fewer pages.	1
	enough already.	1
	and robert langdon is done!	1
	you're a decent writer db.	1
	tell a different story instead of trying to be commercial.      	1
	unbelievable ending.i agree with most of the 1-3 star reviews, but wanted to add this:  the ending is so unbelievable in that peter solomon, after everything he'd been through seems way too lucid.	1
	his turn-around is so fake.	1
	not to spoil, but to all those who have read the book, think of all that peter solomon had gone through and then think of his actions in the end.	1
	way too upbeat if you ask me.      	1
	three times not the charm.while it was entertaining, it was not at the level that i expected.	1
	it seems dan had to actually stretch himself this time and try to make the publishers happy.      	1
	lost symbol by dan brown.i just finished the book yesterday and it was ok...a bit too predictable, but good...i think it would make for a great tv movie, but definately not a big screen movie though... dan browns other books i felt were better.      	1
	got lost in the 'lost symbol'.i have read four of dan browns books and this one was a particularly hard read for me.	1
	the set-up of the characters was unterminably long and i still don't really understand the ending at all.	1
	devinci is still my favorite.      	1
	good read, not the best of dan brown.the story starts off very well and the plot build-up is excellent.	1
	it kept me engrossed for two-thirds of the book but the end was not what i expected.      	1
	why dan?	1
	why?.3 years in the making the lost symbol is probably the years most anticipated book.	1
	after the sucess of the da vinci code and angels & demons, most of us were probably ready for a new langdon adventure.	1
	i know i was.	1
	i finally grabbed my copy and i was really excited to read it, but shortly after i began wondering why.	1
	while the book starts off with dan brown's usual fast paced story telling.	1
	i feel as though the 3 years it took to write this book, really were a waste.	1
	i feel like a majority of this book was written over a weekend, and that brown just borrowed from the already successful well he has been pulling from.	1
	while i wasn't expecting something entirely new angels & demons and the da vinci code were each unique and compelling, the lost symbol is just more of the same.	1
	robert langdon recieves a phone call from a friend, flies to d.c., and then poof get's drawn into the middle of a conspiracy.	1
	while i knew this formula would be present, i was hoping for the same unpredictable and crazy adventures langdon always seems to go through.	1
	while for the most part it is there, the sad part is that with each revelation and question answered you are left feeling, jipped.	1
	nothing is really shocking, or suprising for that matter.	1
	the big twist towards the end you know about 4 chapters before it actually happens leaving you feeling let down.	1
	then the final 'big' revelation which the entire story is surronded, is the biggest jip in history.	1
	i won't spoil it but when something goes from being one thing, to another thing, to another, to let down it kind of sucks.	1
	brown introduces readers to the same cast of characters he always does.	1
	an old friend, a woman who has stake in what langdon is chasing, a villian who while mysterious (is pretty much straight from the da vinci code, only with tattoo's and less christian), mysterious people helping langdon along the way, and the shady one's who seem to have no allegiance, but are somehow tied into the story.	1
	langdon goes through the same trials of wracking his brain to figure out symbols and codes to eventually lead to something that if man possessed would 'tear the fabric of existence!'	1
	the chapters like usual are short and push the reader to try and get a few more chapters under their belt before closing the book.	1
	but, where brown seems to fall way short in this book, is an overuse of information, and constant repeating.	1
	i feel like for every 5 lines of dialogue there about 4 paragraphs about the history of whatever the hell they are talking about.	1
	yes, it's always helpful to know little things, but when a majority of your book ready like a history book it kind of steers you away from the action and suspense.	1
	alot of informatin is common knowledge to anyone who watches the history channel, or has heard the word freemason.	1
	but, brown insists on leading us around like we are 3 and telling us in detail everything there is to know about everything he talks about.	1
	while it shows that he did his research, and maybe that he is trying to avoid alot of the fire he has taken in the past, but it still just really breaks it up too much to follow sometimes.	1
	i found myself skimming to get back to the story at times.	1
	the villian in this book really isn't likeable or warranting of sympathy what-so-ever.	1
	usually there is something in them, that is redeeming, this guy is just an idiot.	1
	apparently he is also super-human because he survives some of the most retarded things, and is able to take out anyone and everyone relatively quickly.	1
	also i kind of got the feeling that everyone in the book was really really gullible.	1
	*spoiler alert* langdon never talks to his friend before bringing something of great value to d.c., everyone seems to notice the make-up that the villian wears but trusts him anyways, everyone let's this man into anything, even knowing that her brother never texts and doesn't know how she still accepts the fact that all of the sudden he figured it out, after the big deciphering they just up and believe that everything has been solved by a security person, and even upon pulling into the driveway with a cia agent no one realizes that there isn't a single police car.	1
	** it just really got to me all these stupid avoidable mistakes.	1
	langdon is supposed to be a professor and katherine (the friends sister, and langdons leading woman for this book) a scientists and they made stupid mistakes the whole book.	1
	where brown could have completely redeemed everything was the ending.	1
	with everything calming down and full decipher it could have been the ultimate revelation in the book.	1
	instead we get a shot of religion and the end.	1
	this makes me really sad.	1
	usually when i reach the end of a dan brown book i feel really satisfied, even with the earlier ones (deception point and digital fortress were excellent) i felt good about reading them.	1
	they kept pace, gave you crucial info but always kept things moving.	1
	i feel like after all of the success and two movies under his belt, he has gotten comfortable.	1
	that is a bad thing in this case.	1
	if he had lost alot of the un-necessary history lesson's the book could have been shorter and read better.	1
	the ending definitely could have been a ton better.	1
	all in all the book wasn't terrible, but it definitely doesn't live up to his previous efforts.	1
	if this was his first novel it would have been forgiveable.	1
	but after everything i'm really not all that excited for another langdon adventure.	1
	if you have some spare time, or like his previous works, or just masons, by all means atleast give it a read.	1
	but if you are looking for the next da vinci code this isn't it.	1
	**spoiler alert** was i the only one who was really frustrated by the deprivation chamber, where brown makes you think that langdon is dead?	1
	i really thought that was un-necessary!!!	1
	***      	1
	the commonality of awe.i had intended to be awake when kindle began downloading this book at 12:01 am.	1
	to paraphrase dan brown, 'if our ancestors could see us reading a book, much more getting it in this fashion, they'd have thought we were gods.'	1
	however, having read all brown's books, this one did not make me want to call in sick from work to keep reading it.	1
	it seemed like a formulaic version of the davinci code...but with a really weird bad guy and an unnecessarily fascist cia boss.	1
	and does he have to keep saying 'disorientated' when 'disoriented' would do nicely.	1
	i don't think i'm being picky, he used the word so often, i couldn't just forget about it.	1
	finally, as the daughter of a shriner and eastern star, and former worthy advisor myself, the masons did not elicit the sense of mystery in me which would enable me to believe the story line.	1
	the story line being that somebody thinks they can become all-powerful from finding the lost symbol.	1
	who thinks the masons have the answer!	1
	okay, so they have an answer.	1
	all that said, however, dan brown has done his homework.	1
	his knowledge of the meaning of symbols, and all their cross-cultural appearances is amazing.	1
	for example, all the ways the number 33 appears in different religious literatures is fascinating.	1
	where does he get this stuff!	1
	and i really look forward to learning more about the science of noetics.	1
	i think using robert langdon to explain all this is a clever way of getting across a major premise of the book.	1
	that premise, i think, is that people across time and cultures have a common sense of awe which is expressed through their own culture and symbols.	1
	if we could just get away from idolizing the symbols, we might be able to get to the godliness in ourselves and in others.       	1
	a good book.everyone has their own ideas about what a quality book is.	1
	for me, the book has to be readable first and foremost.	1
	i've wasted lots of money on books that weren't really read able and i just could bring myself to finish.	1
	second it has to keep my attention and urge me to keep reading even when it's time to go to bed!	1
	the lost symbol is readable and it is very entertaining.	1
	that said, i do not think it is as good as some of his other books like the da vinci code, angels and demons, or deception point.	1
	i do think it was better than his first book, digital fortress though.	1
	while it's only my opinion,  i think people should stop being so critical of books and take them at face value.	1
	that value is, did you enjoy reading the book?	1
	i can honestly say, i enjoyed the the lost symbol.	1
	although, the ending was much more drawn out that i felt it needed as it began to feel like it wouldn't end.	1
	there were also a few parts that i felt weren't of the highest quality thinking, but then again that happens in a lot of books.	1
	they were not that difficult to pass over as dan brown didn't keep bringing them up and for the most part weren't really relevant to the story as a whole.	1
	i will say there were a few twists that made for more interest, but that is something you see in all of dan browns books.	1
	a reason i enjoy reading his works.	1
	so, to finish this review off.	1
	this is a good book and definitely worth reading, but it isn't dan brown's best work.	1
	i recommend you add it to your reading list, especially of you liked the da vinci code and angels and demons.      	1
	the lost editor.while i enjoyed the book and the writing, the editor needs not to be afraid of fame and learn to reduce the repetition.	1
	the story just dragged in parts that should have been cleaned up and the experience would have been much more enjoyable.	1
	i'll not be so quick to buy his next book.         	1
	very very very bad..dvc was good.	1
	but this is the worst book by dan brown.	1
	very very weak and boring.      	1
	not great literature, but i kept reading.i did enjoy the lost symbol, and i think it's brown's best book.	1
	it was an entertaining thriller, although it got sadistic at some points, thanks to a very sick villain.	1
	i loved the masonic references, although i was amused by all of the high ranking government people who were 33rd degree masons in the novel.	1
	my husband is a 33rd degree mason, and i said to him, 'don't you wish?'	1
	he says that brown got some of the details about freemasonry wrong, but he could not tell if that was deliberate--after all the book is fiction--or careless research.	1
	i have visited the house of the temple in washington, and it is a fascinating building.	1
	the weakest part of the novel was the concern about the details of masonic degrees going public.	1
	as a previous reviewer indicated, not many people would care.	1
	brown attempts some philosophy, and it's only an attempt, but at least it might get people to think about some of the ultimate questions of life.	1
	and that's not bad. 	1
	another good page turner.had i read this book before having read 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons' i would probably give it five stars.	1
	it's in the dan brown formula, and that formula works.	1
	but the novelty is gone.	1
	there are also a few unnecessary pages as several folks have pointed out.	1
	i still highly recommend it, though.	1
	it'll suck you in, and you'll have a good ride.	1
	(g)  if you're not into metaphysics (& physics) it may also open your eyes to some new ideas.	1
	in any case, read and enjoy.      	1
	shabby writing.dan tells a good story; its a shame that his prose is sophomoric, his characters are of comic book depth, and the dialog would embarrass a soap opera.	1
	my last dan brown book!	1
	ray    melbourne, fl      	1
	stop re using your plots.the plot reads like it was generated by a computer.	1
	it appears to be a rehash of old themes.	1
	i was disappointed.      	1
	daybagging.perhaps the largest complaint i can level at the lost symbol by dan brown is that, somehow, this is actually a step down in quality (in terms of plot, pacing, writing, structure and logic) from the da vinci code, which i remember being far more exact and far more detailed than anything found here.	1
	i think it can also be argued that the lost symbol is an immature book - everything in it screams first time writer (is it just me, or could you just read just the italics and come away with the same story?	1
	), which is unusual for a writer who has not only several books already published, but is considered by far (far) too many people to be a 'brilliant' writer.	1
	if this doesn't give them pause and reconsider that the da vinci code was simply the right book at the right time - then, more power to them...but for me, the lost symbol felt like a hubris driven eng101 creative writing class project written by a someone who felt he was smarter than both the teacher and the reader.	1
	in the lost symbol i think dan brown proves he's not (no pumpkin sticker for you!).	1
	there is not a moment in this book, not one mystery, not one code, not one second where you're not ahead of robert langdon at every turn and always looking back asking him to step on the gas and catch up; come on man!	1
	a big plus for fans of dan brown is that his books are swift on action (once the da vinci code started rolling, it really didn't stop for too long), but here, langdon drags his feet over the most simplest of clues and tasks because, for some odd reason, he can't accept that perhaps the mason's do have a secret, a treasure, which could truly change the world.	1
	no, langdon is time and again stuck between two pillars of ignorance: the first being that there simply can not be a pyramid in washington, d.c. (and yet, he finds it and it fits neatly into his purse...excuse me, daybag) and the second: he ignores all callings to solve the mystery to whine again and again that he needs to save peter solomon, it never truly dawning on him (despite being told over and over by everyone involved) that perhaps the best way to save peter is to solve the mystery - which, honestly, solves itself.	1
	langdon plays really no part in riddling out the secrets behind the pyramid - again and again brown places the right people at the right time to save langdon a lot of bother, while at the same time padding out the book with useless, often repetitive scenes that clearly were written for the screen and not the page (the entire scenes set inside the noetic sciences building are pure horror movie popcorn and could have easily been edited down or totally out of the book and not missed a beat).	1
	after a few books a hero does get worn, but langdon is worn out here - you can't help but laugh that a man who has the phone number of a blood relative of jesus and could call her up anytime and take her out to see a production of godspell could be this slow - but he is.	1
	and he's also naive, langdon comments that the mason's are truthful, honest and above all loyal people - but, they're also people and people are fallible and the lost symbol proves that langdon is too.	1
	as for the 'villain'(s) of the book - it seems as if somehow brown was trying his hand at being chester gould where evil itself brands people with a peculiar disfigurement.	1
	and as to the 'major' surprise behind the identity of the the main villain - i dare anyone to claim that they were 'surprised' by this.	1
	the wrap up comes quickly and much like the reader, langdon is blindfolded by brown, who denies us (and langdon) information right from the start to get the thrill of finally pulling the hood off our heads and saying 'ta-da!'	1
	to see the look on our faces when we learn that, oh, yeah...i knew that, actually, i figured it right from the start (i mean, brown, you pointed a red arrow right at it) so, yeah, here we are, buy a postcard and let's go.	1
	in the end the lost symbol was never truly lost, just kept and now finally shared it makes me wonder just what's going to happen to those four million, nine hundred, ninety nine thousand other copies of this book out there...it's more a mystery than the lost symbol will ever be.	1
	lost symbols.i do not know wheather to cry or yell out loud!	1
	i can not even laugh--way not funny either.i waited so long for this book and now i am wondering where dan brown went?	1
	it simply does not stand up to his first two in this series.his character, robert langdon, has become a closed minded, know-it-all, professor.	1
	i tried to count how many times langdon said he did not beleive there was a hidden 'word' and after 6 times i gave up.there are 133 chapters,100 would have been enough(already).	1
	so many of them repeat and repeat what was said in previous chapters.	1
	i am so flusterated i want to shake some one, maybe the book editor--- someone ought to pay for this mess!	1
	dan, you need a hug!       	1
	the lost symbol.this book is boring, not enough action.	1
	to much whinning from langdon.	1
	loved all of his other books.      	1
	over all a good read..over all, this was a good book; especially if you are wanting something to pass the time.	1
	the lost symbol did seem to parallel the davinci code pattern; searching for a lost 'treasure', secret society, government involvement, fanatical henchman, etc.	1
	i would not expect this to be the world wide phenomenon that the davinci code was.      	1
	not quite up to par.. if you like conspiracy books, then this book will surely spark your interest.	1
	unlike dan brown's other successfull novels, this one doesn't have enough character development.	1
	i do enjoy the fact that 'the lost symbol' is well researched and well thought out.	1
	for whatever reason, dan brown likes to reiterate certain points over and over and over.	1
	this book could have been a much more interesting read if he cut it down to about 350 pages.      	1
	not his best.after deception point dan brown realized that religious controversy sells, so each book tries to go in that direction, on  he was criticizing the roman catholic church and in  he tried to go against theology, this turned out to be a very succe$$ful endeavor.	1
	i won't say what he's 'preaching' about on this one because i don't want to spoil it for you.	1
	the book is slow, boring and 'preachy' (as another reviewer said).	1
	it's not unreadable though... if you liked his other novels go ahead and get it but this isn't his best.	1
	i think this could be his worst novel but i think it's tied with  which was too predictable.	1
	angels and demons is the best followed by the da vinci code.	1
	don't go out of your way to get this, buy it used or borrow it from a friend, if you haven't read  get that instead for $2.78 with free shipping right here on amazon (used).	1
	thumbs down dan brown.      	1
	interesting but not dan brown's best work.i finished reading the lost symbol some time mid last week and it took me a good two weeks to finish.	1
	this statement alone shows that this particular novel had some slow dragging moments because when i read angels and demons (in mass-market paperback) i read it in seven days and it had 710 pages.	1
	although the idea of ancient mysteries and free masonry sounds like a good topic to tackle, i don't think it was the most exciting topic.	1
	at times, i found myself asking 'why are they going through all this stress with cracking symbols?'	1
	i think the problem was that what they were trying to uncover wasn't as exciting as the two previous books.	1
	da vinci code was centered around discovering the holy grail and angels & demons was about rescuing cardinals from horrific murders  along the ancient path of illumination and finding the anti-matter that threatens to destroy the vatican.	1
	these topics were thrilling and big page turners.	1
	the whole thing with the masonic pyramid was fun at first but later became boring.	1
	also, i was getting confused how they mentioned 'the lost word' when the book is entitled 'the lost symbol.'	1
	overall, the book was ok and i still remain a dan brown reader, but i think it's prior two novels were much better  (angels & demons is still #1 in my book).      	1
	brown has lost all credibility.i've read over a hundred pages in this book, and so far it is pretty hard to read.	1
	very slow, same old brown.	1
	but then i came to the most incredible piece of information in the book.	1
	the redskins..in a playoff game... come on, you can't get away with that nonsense.	1
	what a ridiculous premise.	1
	how much does brown think we can believe?	1
	there has to be at least a little bit of realism in the book, and this really blew it for me.	1
	lol      	1
	it is ok.the success of the da vinci code is a tough act to follow.	1
	this book is okay; it is better than digital fortress and deception point.	1
	the best of the robert langdon books is angel & demons.	1
	it should have been edited better and did seem to drag.	1
	also i figured out who the killer really is less than half way through; it was sadly obvious.	1
	that said; this is not high literature, this is pop fiction.	1
	and for that it is okay.      	1
	while not great literature, it is a good story.many reviewers have been knocking the lost symbol because of various literary qualities.	1
	and i'd have to say that most, if not all, of those assertions are true.	1
	but to me, that's immaterial.	1
	i like to think that i'm like most readers -- i read for the story, not necessarily the literary value.	1
	subsequently, i have equated the lost symbol with a bruce willis or harrison ford movie, for example.	1
	that genre is seldom known for its supremely fine acting, character depth, cultural significance, etc.	1
	but yet they make millions of dollars because people go see those movies for their entertainment value.	1
	the lost symbol, for those of us who read to simply enjoy a creative story, is a good, creative, fast-paced read.	1
	the character development is decent -- enough to get a fair idea of who's who in the story -- even though some of the characters are a bit too stereotypical.	1
	there is some predictability to it, but not a great deal.	1
	in short, it is an entertaining book - which is all i'm really looking for, for my money.	1
	one of the somewhat unique characteristics, however, is that it is written in real time, and that helps keep the story moving at a brisk pace.	1
	my only knock would be that it is essentially the davinci code but set in washington, dc, with the free masons substituting for the templars.	1
	that, and it clearly seems that it is written in such a way as to be easily adaptable for a screenplay for future movie release (in fact, wikipedia reports a tentative 2012 release for the lost symbol movie).	1
	bottom line?if you're looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn't it.if you're looking for a fast-paced, entertaining read and you enjoyed the davinci code, then you'll like the lost symbol.      	1
	robert langdon's third.from the book: the lost symbol is a masterstroke of storytelling---a deadly race through the real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths...all under the watchful eye of brown's most terrifying villain to date.	1
	set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of washington, d.c., the lost symbol accelerates through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	my opinion: i liked this third book starring robert langdon, although i know many people did not care for it.	1
	i agree that dan brown set up this fiction to be ready for a movie contract down the road and it reads as though it is a movie stript and i could envision the camera shots with each chapter.	1
	i found the story entertaining, exciting, at times hard to put down, and i learned a great deal from having read it.	1
	some of the mystery within the story i guessed at correctly early in the book, but the rest was unveiled at the end, as it should be.        	1
	solid follow-up.it isn't surprising to find that many reviewers did not feel that the book 'lived up to expectations,' as this was an almost-inevitable conclusion coming off what turned out to be one of the top-selling novels in history.	1
	i did not personally feel this to be the case as i thought that 'the da vinci code', while good, was not even dan brown's best work, that being 'angels and demons,' in my opinion the best novel i have read to date by any author.	1
	comparing this work with his previous 4 books, 'the lost symbol' is probably most similar to 'the da vinci code' (though it shares similarities with all of brown's books).	1
	many general parallels exist:  1) 1 primary male and 1 primary female protagonist; 2) the search for a lost artifact (or artifacts) related to some ancient mystery and w/ religious implications; 3) a villain with what turns out to be a shocking 'true identity', etc.	1
	in a way it was a parallel version of 'the da vinci code' with a different secret being unveiled and with a setting of washington d.c. rather than france & england.	1
	i also agree with other viewers that have noted the similarities of this book to the 'national treasure' movies, particuarly the first one.	1
	overall i think the 'lost symbol' proved to be a solid novel even if it was doomed to disappoint many readers with the impossible-to-meet expectations that were sure to characterize the follow-up to 'the da vinci code'.	1
	there were certainly some surprises that made it a very intriguing read.	1
	now, it is true that the book was slow-paced at times.	1
	for example, i felt that about the second 100 pages of the book (i.e.	1
	100 - 200, or thereabouts) could have been trimmed of superfluous material and there'd have only been perhaps 25 pages left over.	1
	also, unlike 'the da vinci code', i felt that the book 'fizzled out' at the end without leaving the reader with any truly exciting 'discoveries.'	1
	on the other hand, this book did fortunately seem to lack many of the egregious historical errors of the ilk that tainted 'the da vinci code'.	1
	there was a general appeal to christianity's 'link with the ancient mysteries' mentioned, a statement that would perhaps have found some scholarly support about a century ago but would not find much in that regard from today's new testament scholars.	1
	of course, not knowing much about the history of the freemasons personally, someone more in the know in this particular regard may find my statement regarding fewer historical inaccuracies to be incorrect.	1
	in conclusion, with ridiculously-high expectations left in check, i think the typical dan brown fan should enjoy reading 'the lost symbol' and i would recommend it.     	1
	you get what you pay for.i pre-ordered my copy of the lost symbol months before the release date (like millions of other fans, i suppose).	1
	i thought i had secured the best deal possible (a whopping 60% off rrp!).	1
	in reality i could have gotten it a day earlier and a dollar cheaper if i had just sauntered over to target and picked up a copy.	1
	but, let's not split hairs -- a good book is always worth the wait and the extra buck.however, i guess i was in for more reality shock.	1
	after six years in the making, the lost symbol is no better than the da vinci code.	1
	it is a fair companion for the beach or that long plane trip or a few sleepless nights.	1
	there are some unexpected turns and twists and some interesting esoterica to google later on, if you're into that.	1
	but it is overlong, overwrought and clunky overall.	1
	there are much too much explanations on explanations.	1
	the pattern of dialogue is repetitive to the point of annoying.	1
	a bit of spirited and principled editing could have reduced it by a third and not lose the plot.i don't want to give the impression that the lost symbol is terrible -- it is a fairly competent thriller, comparable to the da vinci code.	1
	but, i was expecting more from dan brown this time around, unfortunately.      	1
	a washingtonian's view.in this review i don't plan to compare this new brown book with the book.	1
	rather, i want to add a long-time washingtonian's reactions to this much anticipated volume set in the nation's capital.	1
	for those who like secret codes, hidden clues, incomprehensible cryptic charts and other brown specialities, you will not be disappointed.	1
	while not much goes on in the first 70 pages or so, at that point the book takes off and becomes a real page turner.	1
	there is a lot of information to internalize, but the book ain't dull.	1
	brown generally does a good job on his washington geography and folkways, but there are some exceptions:  metro stations do not serve amtrak; metro trains do not have conductors; it would be impossible to land a copter in dupont circle park due to the trees.	1
	the cia i believe is still foreclosed by law from taking actions within the u.s.--none of the chiefs of the capitol hill police we have had would prostrate themselves to the cia, especially not on their own turf.	1
	as a kalorama resident, i found brown's setting of an important part of the story in 'kalorama heights' to be fun, but i think he was on the wrong side of connecticut avenue and really meant kalorama.	1
	but i learned some things from the book, especially about the interior of the capitol and the art present in the building, and enough about the masons to last me a lifetime.	1
	i also will never look at some familiar buildings the same way again.	1
	brown also educated me on abstruse concepts like 'universal consciousness' and 'noetic science.'	1
	the guy supplements his fantastic imagination with substantial research--no wonder he ran two years over his deadline.	1
	i do think there are a few too many subplots; and the big surprise knocked me flat even though it was really stretching things.	1
	there are plenty of cryptic charts to keep the interested busy for a while--the book is well put together.	1
	but brown has committed my one 'sin to be avoided at all costs.'	1
	several of his characters act in such a dumb fashion, oblivious to the most obvious warning signs, that it drives me up the wall (yes, katherine, i am talking about you!).	1
	nonetheless, a worthy successor volume to the book which stands alone quite nicely on its own.	1
	enjoy!      	1
	fascinating vehicle for spreading an important, timely message.having read all 4 of dan brown's previous novels, let me first say that the cadence of this book is classic dan brown.	1
	there are multiple threads progressing in parallel.	1
	just as a thread reaches fever pitch, the chapter ends and you are back to continue a different thread.	1
	you are always hanging, awaiting resolution.	1
	brown keeps you reading.	1
	he keeps you curious and not only about what will happen next but with questions like...does such a site actually exist in dc?	1
	does such a painting actually include these details?	1
	as usual, brown researches and then weaves in to the plot fascinating information on topics that were, to this point, a mystery to most readers.	1
	in this book, brown provides a lot of information regarding the masons and noetic science, but ,  at least in my case,  still left me hungry to learn more, similar to the amount of added interest that brown evoked with his past novels regarding the illuminati or the knights templar.	1
	while, as usual, the novel includes unexpected twists, what i found most surprising and refreshing in this brown work was that, this time, his focus was not just on developing an intriguing story but in actually advocating a belief---in this case providing context, scientific  and historical foundations to the concept that  '...ye are all gods' and that we are creators through our thoughts.	1
	fans of writers such as eckhart tolle and neale donald walsch will find kindred spirits in brown's characters peter and catherine solomon.	1
	perhaps novels such as this can go as far to promote the evolution of consciousness as non-fiction works on the subject.	1
	thank you, dan brown for using your talent, research and popularity to lend legitimacy to this message.       	1
	a very unbalanced book.yes dan brown can write a pacey, exciting thriller and no he is incapable of balanced, fair writing.	1
	he clearly favours the masons with their diabolical, fear filled rituals and appears to even agree with their obsession with fear, death and violence claiming it helps them to appreciate life!	1
	utter nonsense.	1
	apparently meditating on skulls and bones in a dark room filled with sulphur (black magic associations with killing enemies) beneath the white house  while contemplating war, helps the masonic politician appreciate life!	1
	it appears to be okay to poke fun at the easy target catholics in two of his other books, but he treads far too carefully with the masons, seemingly terrified that they will covertly ruin his career?	1
	and even ... knobble him?	1
	despite his detailed attempted revelation of the meaning of many masonic symbols he fails to elucidate the most obvious masonic symbol, namely the square.	1
	on the one hand he depicts the masons as privy to the hallowed secrets of life, and yet fails to tell the reader that the masons are obsessed with the 'square' because they believed the world and the universe were flat and shaped like a square!	1
	genius masons eh!	1
	brown comes across as a new boy at school desperately trying to lick the ar**** of the bigger boys to stay in the inner `club'.	1
	sad and pathetic.	1
	why couldn't he leave it at 450 pages?	1
	?.let me start out by saying that i admire dan brown (or any author capable of being published for that matter), and that i was completely captivated by this story for the past week and a half!	1
	then, all of the sudden - once the bad guys were revealed, and the day was saved - i noticed that there was another 50-60 pages to go!!	1
	unfortunately, there was little that interested me in those final pages, so when i finally finished i felt like the read wasn't nearly as pleasurable as it actually was.	1
	basically, i loved this story right up until the climax - i literally couldn't wait to find out what happened next.	1
	then, when the storyline was wrapped up, the story turned into a boring/silly lesson on history and religion.	1
	it's a shame because i couldn't tell enough people about how much i loved my new book - and now when people ask, i just won't portray the same enthusiasm.	1
	it's definetely worth a read, just expect db to do his thing and write way too much dialogue!!	1
	!       	1
	yawn.i'll keep this short.	1
	you select a dan brown offering because you read the da vinci code and you loved it, so you spend the money and hope for a reprise.	1
	well, this isn't it, not even close.	1
	incomprehensible ending with a yawn, who cares 'this has got to be stopped or life as we know it will end' climax.	1
	please, dan, why don't you and m. night shyamalan get together and talk to each other about where it all went wrong?      	1
	the lost symbol.angels and demons and the davinci code had plots that developed quickly and featured location, location, location.	1
	one can forgive and even ignore inaccuracies (artistic, historical, religious...) for the sake of a good read - which is why the lost symbol, for me, was so very disappointing.	1
	over-researched, plodding, condescendng, predictable: as if these flaws were not sufficient to encourage my moving on to the next kindle download, there is the huge problem of feeling &#34;had.&#34; mr. brown begins his story with a (surprise!)	1
	highly questionable premise, which he attempts to support by throwing every &#34;fact&#34; he researched at his readers.	1
	i was bored with this latest effort and will just watch tom hanks in the davinci code again rather than make a trip to d.c. in search of symbols.  	1
	maybe i was expecting too much.i was somewhat disappointed by this book.	1
	i read both books with the same main character ('davinci code' and in my opinion the far better one, 'angels & demons') and loved them, so i was expecting this one to follow in similar footsteps.	1
	well, it started of good.	1
	the (almost) whole novel is fast-paced with each chapter ending with a cliffhanger that makes you want to read 'just one more chapter'.	1
	but somewhere 3/4 ways into it, it looses its steam.	1
	the last few chapters have a little too much of the 'philosophical' stuff, and although there is a major surprise revelation, it still wasn't enough to fall back into it.	1
	at least for me... in the end it was just an ok read.	1
	quite an average fare.the book is quite an average fare as compared to browns previous thrillers.	1
	angels and demons is in opinion one of his best story telling works.	1
	especially langdons character is not etched properly.	1
	he vacillates between being almost omnipotently erudite to being irrationally slow.. i wouldnt recommend spending your $10 on this book..stay away..      	1
	great plot, flat finish..this book reads like a screenplay in the opening chapters, then gets a bit tedious with it's descriptions of location, location, location.	1
	as the story progresses character development diminishes to the point of assumption.	1
	i've read all but the last 20 pages and somehow lost motivation to finish it off as the ending is so flat.	1
	especially disappointing since the book could have had a intellectually stimulating ending what with all the noetic sciences buildup.	1
	instead we got a mediocre and violent end.	1
	still, i can't wait to re-visit washington, d.c. and go on a tour to see all that i didn't see.       	1
	horrible.unfortunately any slop dan brown writes is guaranteed to reach the top of the bestseller list.	1
	'the lost symbol' is no exception.	1
	brown phones it in by plagiarizing his own work, notably 'angels and demons.'	1
	langdon teams up with alluring female sidekick!	1
	they tear around a city while being tracked by the man!	1
	see as they race against the clock to get to reveal a secret while fighting a physically freakish, comically evil antagonist!	1
	as a special added bonus, the plot twists are so absurd that the reader may be tempted to hurl the book out the window.	1
	i wish i could give it zero stars but apparently that's not an option on amazon.        	1
	not one of his best, for sure.by now, anyone who has read brown's previous works knows robert langdon, who is back for his third round of esoteric adventure.	1
	ostensibly in washington dc for a speaking engagement, he finds out that he's actually been lured there under false pretenses and that the person who supposedly invited him there has been kidnapped, and his hand has been left on the floor of the capitol rotunda.	1
	langdon feels he has no choice but to get involved, and finds himself battling not only his friend's captor, but the cia as well.	1
	hmm.	1
	the captor wants something that langdon has, which will supposedly lead him to a secret pyramid in which lies the heart of the 'ancient mysteries.'	1
	there's a catch: the cia doesn't want langdon to cooperate and tries to thwart him at every turn.	1
	langdon, accompanied by the kidnap victim's scientist sister, goes on a merry chase around dc in an effort to save his friend.	1
	so far, nothing new here in the dan brown formula.	1
	he chases around for about  the first 300 or so pages, throwing around a lot of esoteric knowledge and taking the reader on a tour of  washington dc's 'mystical' architecture, then things settle down a bit so we get some back story to help understand and to put things in perspective before things begin to heat up once more.	1
	i'll give him this much: brown manages to throw a lot of arcane and esoteric knowledge and theory out there (which i always find interesting even if  i know a lot of it is just too unreal) and there is a definite plot twist i didn't see coming.	1
	the short chapters act as mini-cliffhangers that made me want to continue reading until i could hear langdon say something along the lines of  'aha!	1
	this all makes sense,' which he does many times throughout the novel.	1
	on the other hand, his writing is often repetitive, tedious, and clunky.	1
	characterization is obviously not his strong point, so frankly, i didn't care about the players involved.	1
	but for me, the worst part was that after spending so much time on this book, i felt like i was robbed at the end.	1
	normally i can suspend disbelief, sit back and relax and enjoy books like this if the end pays off, making it worth the ride, but not this time.	1
	i didn't particularly care that much for it, but this book has already sold in the millions of copies, so it all works out for the author, and there are many people who've reviewed the book and absolutely loved it.	1
	so for that reason, i'd say that although i can't personally recommend it, people who are dan brown fans might want to give it a try and judge it for themselves. 	1
	the journey was far more interesting than the destination.....get a large cauldron and put in some of harris' red dragon, some of koontz's cold blooded killers, some of brown's da vinci code, some american history text book, a dash of redfield's the celestine prophecy, mix it with patterson's short chapter writing style and sprinkle in some washington dc tourist maps and you have the lost symbol.	1
	i found the first 4/5ths of the book fairly interesting and felt that brown had been successful in repeating what he did in the da vinci code...but then i read the last 1/5th of the book.	1
	initially it's a roller-coaster ride similar to da vinci code and, also like the da vinci code, taking place all in one day.	1
	there are clues that langdon follows, dead-ends, misdirections, misreading of clues and the usual chase sequences.	1
	fortunately i was on a trans-atlantic trip, and it did help pass the time.	1
	what started off as a page turner, ended up being a yawner leaving the reader with 'why did i bother taking this trip?'	1
	a page turner, but you hate yourself for turning the pages.the technique is the same as in the davinci code, and a fair amount of unusual information is imparted, but on the whole it seems like perils of pauline hokum.	1
	the setting is not particularly fascinating and the subject matter seems like much ado about nothing.      	1
	what a waste.i was really lookimg forward to his book but it was just ok.  the pace of the storyline seemed very franatic.	1
	not nearly as suspenseful as his first 2 robert langdon books.       	1
	was hoping for something better.there have been very few books that i have read that engaged me as did the da vinci code.	1
	my expectations for this book were very high.	1
	the reality was not up to my expectations.	1
	i did not find this book to be the page turner that i had hoped for.	1
	while masonic lore is interesting and i am sure that brown did his research, it did not result in a very good story.	1
	the pace was uneven and as has previously been said the arc is very similar to the da vinci code just different names and locations.	1
	langdon's character had very little depth and looking back on the read i think he brought very little to the story and less to the resolution.	1
	the end was simply flat, no great revelation, and i was left wondering why i had spent the time reading the previous pages to get there.       	1
	fizzler.pros: good action ride; nice integration of current technology; the beginning of several chapters could serve as a guidebook to some of washington d.c.'s more famous monuments.	1
	cons: transparent twists (at least, to most mystery fans); shallow characterizations.	1
	my main gripe, though, is that dan does not have the spiritual depth to carry off his ambitious themes.	1
	although he makes some conciliatory gestures to other world religions and traditions, in the end he seems unable to rise above his hackneyed, fallen-away-catholic opinions of 'truth' and 'revelation.'	1
	skip the last 50 pages, unless you just feel the need to be preached at by someone with a very sophomoric grasp of comparative religion--and you want to close the book with a disappointed sigh and an eye-roll.       	1
	long awaited, quickly read, langdon longing returns.a good, not great, follow up to the da vinci code.	1
	well-researched and intricately plotted.	1
	i did figure out something important very early in the book, which was revealed very late in the book.	1
	i don't consider myself necessarily astute at forshadowing and therefore felt a little letdown by this piece of the puzzle brown attempted to hide.	1
	still a good read - i had to find out for sure that my guess was correct!	1
	perhaps it read more easily since i am more familiar with washington d.c. than i am with rome or paris (from the previous two langdon books).      	1
	good dan brown read.this was a good follow on to the other robert langdon books !	1
	i read it on my kindle, which amazon did a good job with the electronic version.	1
	as with all the other dan brown books, read it as entertainment !         	1
	a third chase for robert langdon.after reading the first 100 pages, i thought for sure that i would rate 'the lost symbol' at five stars.	1
	dan brown hooked me in early and i read through the book in less than a week (fast for me).	1
	while the rest of his story was still entertaining, he wore me down with inaccuracies and repetitions.	1
	the first and most obvious inaccuracy was that of harvard professor langdon translating 'jeova sanctus unus' as the 'one true god.'	1
	surely langdon would know that his school's own motto is 'veritas,' meaning 'truth,' and that 'true' would be a variation of that, not 'sanctus' -- 'holy.'	1
	and, in addition to his usual weak theological points, brown riddles us with puzzles -- too often repeated and too many.	1
	poor langdon gets bounced around in so many different directions, it's hard to imagine him staying sane.	1
	even with its problems, however, 'the lost symbol' fulfills its role as a smart and intriguing page-turner.	1
	brown's use of science caught my interest and whetted my appetite for more.	1
	the only criticism i have of this aspect is that brown used a scientific deus ex machina, 'god out of a machine,' to rescue langdon from certain death by drowning.	1
	it's one thing to have langdon pull a houdini, but replicating amniotic fluid in place of water to save him is a bit of a stretch.	1
	also farfetched is peter solomon's resilience at the end when he escorts landon down hundreds of stairs from top to bottom inside dc's most compelling landmark.	1
	considering both their ordeals, especially solomon's, i can't imagine either of them being able to lift a finger, let alone traipse around washington, dc.	1
	yet, in another way, i'm glad they did.	1
	i got a tour of dc that i thoroughly enjoyed.	1
	certainly, this will make for a fascinating illustrated edition of 'the lost symbol,' as well as a cinematographer's dream movie.	1
	this book i would rate more or less alongside 'the davinci code,' but definitely below 'angels and demons,' 'deception point,' and even 'digital fortress.'	1
	for example, brown's use of deus ex machina to save david becker in 'digital fortress' is more believable.	1
	'the lost symbol,' with its somewhat nebulous ending, opens the door for a fourth novel of langdon's adventures.	1
	and brown has the skills to improve considerably on this.	1
	fr.	1
	dennis mercieri      	1
	same story different setting.as a huge fan of both angels and demons and the da vinci code, i eagerly awaited the next installment.	1
	i have to say, after reading it, it was a bit of a disappointment.	1
	the story had a lot of the same plot twists and general themes already used in the previous works.	1
	langdon is brought into the drama on the way to a lecture, there's the cop that's unclear if they're good or bad, the beautiful female scientist who's family is in trouble, blahblahblah.	1
	really over all, i had trouble getting engrossed in the story.	1
	at times it was flat out dull.	1
	i found myself skipping ahead a few pages int he hopes that it might get good.	1
	it wasn't the worst thing i have ever read.	1
	but given the other 2 works in the series, it did not meet my expectations.	1
	perhaps if i had not read the other two and liked them so much, it would not be such a let down.	1
	still, overall, the lost symbol is, in my opinion, mediocre at best.      	1
	would rather read about cockroaches....i don't quite see the point on commenting on whether or not dan brown is a good writer or not.	1
	stylistically, he's fine.	1
	he doesn't say anything in a particularly nuanced manner, but he can clearly communicate plot and detail and for a book of this genre, that's all i need.	1
	but he's become so predictable.	1
	i love the earlier review that listed out the boring path most of the chapters took - there's always a character in the dark, and then, most conveniently, someone who's a friggin expert illuminates all, and then there's a startling realization that brings everything together as the chapter ends.	1
	boooooo.	1
	the biggest disappointment was that i figured out after about 20 minutes of reading what the 'pyramid' was going to be and if i, average american reader, can figure out what shocks langdon to his core at the novel's end, then i do not believe brown has lived up to any expectations of providing an exciting, unexpected, new, entertaining book.	1
	honestly i should have just reread 'angels & demons' or that one he wrote that explains how crustaceans are just giant cockroaches of the sea.	1
	now that was interesting.      	1
	disappointing.....i had a difficult time suspending disbelief.	1
	the writing did not impress me.	1
	i kept waiting for more energy and the transition from the mundane to the supernatural or surreal.	1
	it didn't happen for me.	1
	the story has it high points and some interesting concepts about the mind, science and the bible; but there was too much pontification by the author.	1
	the premise of the antagonist is the most interesting aspect of the story.	1
	the tough cia chief character was a bit trite.	1
	there is too much blah, blah, blah at the end.	1
	i wanted more: more color, more spectacle, more imagination.	1
	the politics and machinations of real life washington, dc hold more intrigue than this story.         	1
	so disappointing.i listened to the unabridged audio edition of this one and i was alternatively bored and disgusted by this book.	1
	there really isn't a lot going on here.	1
	the hero spends his time chatting to various people, running around being pursued or we are forced to relive flashbacks with the crazy tattooed bad guy that i just found myself losing interest.	1
	i don't much care for crazed mentally deranged badguys, to begin with, and not only do we have to watch him, we are forced to share his pov, and learn how he came to be that way.	1
	i could care less.	1
	i wanted to hear about the mystery and the puzzles and less about the crazy insane dude.	1
	i gave up sometime after the scene where robert is nearly drowned.	1
	i found the story too dark and depressing and i just didn't find it worth the effort of listening to, to discover the ending of the mystery.       	1
	an entertaining piece of garbage.with the da vinci code being incredibly successful, dan brown had to wonder how he could match or even top that success.	1
	several years later, here is the result, the lost symbol.	1
	in this thriller, robert langdon spends the night in washington dc tracking down the century old secrets of the masons and other societies and religions dating back thousands of years.	1
	i've read all of brown's novels, and really enjoyed digital forces, deception point and angels and demons.	1
	i started not liking the davinci code as i read it and before i reached the 'startling' conclusion.	1
	each chapter ended with langdon deciphering a code and me wondering 'how did he get that from that' then realizing its fiction so i kept reading.	1
	everyone has heard about the masons and their supposed secrets as well as the many masonic symbols in american history, such as the pyramid in the dollar bill.	1
	this book expounds on those.	1
	this book is a clone of the da vinci code except it fails to match up to its predecessor in many areas.	1
	first, after reading, i wonder how brown filled up 500 pages.	1
	langdon does very little code deciphering or symbol interpreting.	1
	second, the bad guy is just one man, and seems to have a lot more power than necessary.	1
	finally, the big secret is a big letdown.	1
	i don't know if brown feels like he has to bash christianity in his novels or what, but in this one he attacks every religion in a can't we all just get along type conclusion.	1
	i'm not going to spoil any of the big secrets, but it really is kind of silly, and the conclusion makes the previous 490 pages kind of meaningless (they were fighting over that!?)	1
	while i was critical above, the book did keep my interest and kept me turning the pages.	1
	fans of brown should read katherine neville's the eight for more code breaking adventures (but avoid its sequel, the fire).	1
	based on the numbers, this book is a hit.	1
	but chances are a lot of people are going to be disappointed and let down.	1
	this book just doesn't deliver.	1
	dan brown's formula.lost symbol was a disappointment.	1
	it's as though dan brown has conceived only one plot and, when he writes a new book, he changes the characters and the location but it's basically the same book.	1
	this one takes place in washington dc and, while it is full of interesting tidbits about dc landmarks, the story is repetitve, predictable and formulaic.      	1
	it should be article, not a novel.possible spoilers as many others i was quite disappointed.	1
	the book plot works on basic principle: robert l is not convinced that specific object points to real thing, explaining everything as metaphorical or symbolical.	1
	then someone proves him wrong.	1
	he is amazed.	1
	object indeed points to real location or clue.	1
	then he is attacked or chased.	1
	finding the next clue/location/object is not conviceted... [repeat/rinse].	1
	after repeating this schema for about 10 times there is ending.	1
	and... apparently it points to something as metaphorical or symbolical as suggested at the very beginning.	1
	the ending isn't up to standarts i would expect from dan brown.	1
	while details about architecture, paintings or rites are quite interesting, there seems to be no direct connection between them.	1
	all point to or explain some aspects of masonic pyramid, but they are not interlinked as it was in previous brown's books.	1
	neotic practices is another low point in this book.	1
	i would never call it 'science'.	1
	it is technobable about mystical human powers.	1
	making it part of the book's plot was huge mistake.	1
	putting some crash test dumies instead of few characters would improve the storyline.	1
	the most human characters were probably some extras like guard nunez.	1
	cia's-uber-national-crisis doesn't sound so critical once you hear what is it.	1
	figuring out who is mal'akh is so easy.	1
	(tips: how andros knew about pyramid, why is he always called inmate 37 when describing prison story).	1
	finally the editing gives me a headache.	1
	some chapters are many pages long, some are 'cutscenes'.	1
	the amount of italics used is a strain for the eyes.	1
	some chapters could be removed completely and no one would notice.	1
	overally all the interesting facts about masons, ther part in designing/building washington, paintings could be written as briliant article in national geographic instead of this bloated brick of woodware.	1
	please refrain fom destoying tropical forest by buing this book.	1
	regards mj    	1
	characters fall flat.i read the whole book, and was compelled to finish it.	1
	i did want to see exactly how everything turned out.	1
	fortunately i am an avid reader, so this was no huge task.	1
	by the halfway point of the book, i really didn't care about the fates of the characters.	1
	i thought mal'akh was just too dark and too far gone.	1
	what i did enjoy was the scenery of washington d.c.  i've only had the chance to visit once, and didn't have time to see everything.	1
	the descriptions of the buildings and artwork were excellent, and have increased my interest in another, longer, potential visit to the capitol.	1
	this, however, does not carry the story.      	1
	not great....but not bad.....when i was a young man, my favorite music group was jethro tull.	1
	amazing that they still play, isn't it?	1
	that's just an aside.... the real point is that their epic album 'thick as a brick' - an lp length opus of one continuous song covering both sides was magnificent.	1
	amazing.	1
	novel.	1
	i can still sing along to it from start to end 30 plus years later when i hear it.	1
	sadly, with the applause (and beaucoup bucks) ringing in their ears from 'thick as a brick', tull made the huge mistake of trying to do it again, churning out the forgettable album length creation 'passion play'.	1
	i remember little of it, other than the fact that i was disappointed that they tried to follow up a unique creation by churning out a 'part deux' effort.	1
	other than the godfather ii, i've never really seen anyone do that successfully.	1
	and even then, coppolla failed years later when he dragged us painfully through godfather iii, which proved that ii was the exception to the general rule.	1
	and so it is with our friend dan brown.	1
	he's written a lot of books and i've found all of them tremendously entertaining.	1
	i'd mark every one of them in my top 100 faves over the last 20 years or so.	1
	they were all thoughtful and creative, yet until now, he generally followed a different path with each.	1
	this, on the other hand, resembles passion play to me.	1
	it will not be nearly as memorable as the da vinci code.	1
	it is formulaically almost identical, whereas his other books, may have had similarities, but were significantly different.	1
	clearly, he set out to churn out a 're-make' of the da vinci code, simply substituting the masons for the catholic church.	1
	oh, brown is brilliant, and he brilliantly lays out the story.	1
	things that are surprising and enlightening are all over this book.	1
	i'm glad that i learned a lot from it in an entertaining way.	1
	but as the saying goes, i couldn't help but have this nagging feeling that 'i'd seen this movie before'.	1
	it will sell a lot and make a lot of money in hardcover, paperback, electronic and movie revenue.	1
	but brown is capable of so much more - one wonders why he didn't have more confidence in himself to develop a completely different template, drawing upon his obvious intellect and tremedous research skills.	1
	at the end of the day, this was a good read, i'm glad i read it, and if the da vinci code had never appeared, i'd give it five stars and clap like there is no tomorrow.	1
	so i commend this to people as a good read.	1
	i'm just left with this strange sense that i came for a banquet and got meat loaf.      	1
	2 3/4 stars.plot/storyline: 1 1/4 stars the plot was somewhat intriguing throughout the first three quarters of the book.	1
	as usual, dan brown managed to unearth and relate interesting historical facts and conspiracy theories.	1
	i did get a bit tired of hearing about how the poor masons are so misunderstood, but other than that, it was a good group to feature.	1
	imagine you are watching a television show.	1
	a guy gets pushed out of an airplane and is plunging to his death; cut to commercial.	1
	after commercial, we go back to the falling guy, but wait!	1
	suddenly, there is a flashback showing how he secretly put on a parachute just before getting on a plane.	1
	he's saved!	1
	however, you sit and wonder, 'wait a minute.	1
	i saw everything this guy did right on camera before this guy got on the plane.	1
	when did he have time to get a parachute?'	1
	this entire novel is filled with this.	1
	the author doesn't want the reader to know or guess anything, so he backtracks continuously to fill in his plot holes.	1
	there were some interesting facts embedded in the storyline.	1
	i enjoyed the portions where langdon is having flashbacks and repeats classroom lectures.	1
	there was a major plot hole involving the `bad guy.'	1
	i cannot go into much detail due to spoilers.	1
	suffice it to say, there is a portion of the book told from his point of view early on that negates some revealed facts later.	1
	the ending was excessively slow as the book goes on for several chapters after the action and danger are over.	1
	i also found the resolution to be simplistic and contrived.	1
	character development: 3 stars i do not expect a whole lot of character development in a novel of this type.	1
	i expect just enough to justify actions.	1
	he does fail in a spectacular way with the character of peter.	1
	throughout the novel, we are not given near enough insight to judge peter.	1
	at the end, some characterization is tacked on, but it is a bit too little, too late.	1
	writing style: 2 1/2 stars i have heard many people denigrate mr. brown's writing, but i have to disagree on all counts, save one, which i will explain below.	1
	sure, his writing is rather simple with no flowers.	1
	however, this is an action novel.	1
	for the type of book, his writing style is exactly what is called for.	1
	the only problem i have with mr. brown's writing style is still a large one.	1
	his suspense technique is forced and unnecessary.	1
	editing/formatting: 4 3/4 stars having spaces between the paragraphs was annoying because i read with my font set to '3.'	1
	the extra spacing just causes more page turns.	1
	rating: pg-15 for adult situations, sexual references & violence 	1
	could not find the symbol.i bought the book.	1
	i took it to the beach.	1
	i was happy.	1
	not.	1
	this is a sad product for someone who has written a number of interesting novels.	1
	i hoped to find some great surprise at the ending and instead ended up skimming the ending just to get through!	1
	shame on you, dan.	1
	you didn't need the money so why did you do it???	1
	?      	1
	what kind of ending was that?.ok, i'm enjoying the book, even with the abundance of over explaining, and then it ends.	1
	end????	1
	what happened to all the other characters?	1
	nothing was resolved.	1
	i am really upset.	1
	i got involved in these people and then there's no real ending.	1
	ugh.	1
	what a disappointment.	1
	(did i miss something?	1
	should i go back and try again???)	1
	da vinci lighting in a bottle elusive.although i enjoyed the lost symbol, it was no da vinci code.	1
	although it tried.	1
	dan took the da vinci code and moved it to washington dc.	1
	it was interesting learning some of the meaning behind the architecture in dc, just as it was interesting to muse over rome and paris in da vinci.	1
	beyond that, i thought the storyline tried to follow the script a bit too much.	1
	this time, the characters and the events were too cliched.	1
	there was the woman who sounded like a man, evil people, 'seeing' with hands and just a lot of people taking themselves overseriously.	1
	if you read one book a year, i wouldn't make this it.	1
	however, if you're a serious reader and a db fan, you should get it and enjoy some reminiscing and connecting the dots to dvc.      	1
	not as good as the da vinci code, but not a total dud either.plot summary:  robert langdon's old friend and mentor, peter solomon, calls in a favor and asks robert to give a speech at a charity event being held in the capitol building.	1
	when robert arrives, he finds his friend is missing, and a mysterious `invitation' waiting in the rotunda, one that he must solve if he wants to save peter.	1
	someone wants a secret that has been protected by the freemasons since the beginning of washington d.c.'s existence, and robert must choose whether to protect the secret and sacrifice his friend, or reveal what the masons would take to their graves.	1
	at the end of , i felt like i had been taken on an incredible ride and learned secret revelations that were truly earth-shattering (no matter that it's all make-believe).	1
	i just finished the lost symbol, and this time i feel like i was moderately entertained, but the big secret was a big bust.	1
	to make matters worse, i had correctly guessed the `final resting place' of the `treasure,' and i since i usually suck at predicting the outcome of a mystery, this one must be way too simple if i honed in on it within the first chapter or two.	1
	as i read this book, i kept grumbling to myself, asking when the action was gonna start.	1
	i was fairly bored for the first third of this novel, and when robert langdon finally got his [...]on the run, it started to get interesting.	1
	too bad it never matched the intensity and excitement of the da vinci code though.	1
	there are some good spine-tingly torture scenes, but the bad-guy is pretty much invincible throughout, and it's almost an act of god that finally takes him down.	1
	it's a nice vote of confidence from dan brown that the entire cia cannot find a man who doesn't have a hair on his body, and is tattooed from head to toe.	1
	the funny thing is, they seem to have no trouble finding everybody else, just not the 6'3' guy who is bulked on steroids and resembles the sunday comics page.	1
	okay, i've groused enough about what i didn't like, but this book is far from a complete dud.	1
	the washington d.c. trivia and history that dan brown doles out is absolutely fascinating.	1
	i kept going back to my laptop so i could pull up images of the paintings, statues, and buildings that are mentioned, and yes, i'm itching to visit our nation's capitol now.	1
	the true history of washington d.c. stole the show, and it makes the lost symbol revelation feel like a complete letdown by comparison.	1
	in this case, the fiction could not compete with the reality.      	1
	do not buy this kindle book if you are visually impaired!.do not buy this kindle book if you are visually impaired!	1
	the publisher chose to disable the text to speech feature on the kindle edition.	1
	i wasted $9.99 because the indication that the text to speech was disabled was not clear.	1
	amazon.com should indicate this at the top of the listing.  	1
	can someone please explain?.okay, i agree with many of the reviewers here.	1
	great literature, it isn't.	1
	dan brown just doesn't get it; to be a writer, you have to actually know how to write.	1
	a little more characterization would be nice, too.	1
	maybe make them at least two dimensional, dan?	1
	that being said, i went ahead and purchased the lost symbol rather than wait for it at the library.	1
	i should have waited.	1
	the action is fast-paced and does keep one engaged.	1
	you do have to suspend disbelief to read this book, but that's fiction for you.	1
	my problem with the book is that after the action ends, there's a lot of the book left.	1
	warning: the following constitutes a spoiler.	1
	can someone please explain to me how a man who has had a hand removed, basically a butcher job, in the last 24 hours, seen his son die horifically, thinks his sister may be dead, and has undergone physical and psychological torture, can think that escorting robert langdon around washington dc in the middle of the night, because he deserves to understand what's gone on, is his life's priority at that moment?	1
	please.	1
	does dan brown live in a cave?	1
	does he know nothing about human nature?	1
	basic psychology?	1
	all that i can conclude is that in the last several chapters of this book, brown is working out his personal theological/metaphysical/philosophical creed.	1
	i very much enjoyed the davinci code in spite of the writing, angels and demons not so much (just too farfetched even for fiction), but i would have to rank this one at the bottom of the dan brown heap.	1
	get it from the library, or at least wait for the paperback.      	1
	i liked it, i will recommend it and it was almost as good as davinci.ok ok ok,  i don't understand some of the reviews.	1
	i did see some of the plot twists coming but not most of them.	1
	i enjoyed it, the book kept me engaged and i will recommend it.	1
	it is better than angels and demons, not quite as good as dv code but then how could it have been.	1
	good job      	1
	i hope it's his last one...i sincerely hope that the lost symbol is dan brown's last book using this formula.	1
	after the davinci code & angels and demons readers will find the story, pace, twists and overall plot very familiar.	1
	other than the physical setting, there's nothing new here.	1
	each page felt like i'd read it before because i essentially had in brown's previous books.	1
	unfortunately i believe that dan brown's books have been getting weaker over time.	1
	having recently reread  i enjoyed it significantly more than the lost symbol, despite its now dated technological references.	1
	i'd wait to buy this until the million copies that sold the first day show up on amazon for a couple of bucks each used.      	1
	a grain of salt required.brown's thrillers' wild popularity is due not to quality writing, nor to well fleshed-out characters, but to subject matter, a fact worth thinking about.	1
	readers would be well advised, with 'the lost symbol' as with his other books, to take his assertions of fact cautiously.	1
	brown's characters habitually break off into expository paragraphs asserting fact, history and philosophy, breaking the action; a better writer would integrate them into the action rather than interrupt it.	1
	i found, too, his villain entirely unbelievable, so far from human as to be ineffective dramatically, and, in the end, failing to serve the message of the book.	1
	that said, the masonic lore is fascinating.	1
	the breathable fluorinated liquid, by the way, contrary to a skeptic's opinion above, is entirely real, if implausibly used in the story.      	1
	exceptionally boring.this book is a badly cloned version of his two previous books, it is 200 pages too long, the plot and twists are obvious.	1
	most of the characters in the book are disconnected and none are really likable that the reader can hang on to.	1
	even robert langdon himself, he could have shut up half of the book to make the story more readable, but instead he went on with the constant rambling of 'facts' that gets extremely tedious to read at times on top of too many 'now i get it, now i don't' moments.	1
	i won't comment on the bad writing, you obviously don't read a dan brown book for his prose.	1
	i've never written a review before until this book compelled me to.	1
	i can't believe i waited 7 years for this crap.	1
	save your money for something else.      	1
	good until... almost the end.this was a book i could just not put down.	1
	the story moved along really well and kept you enthralled.	1
	then the climax happened, and you had to deal with the last 20 percent of the book board board of your a**      	1
	is okay ... but geometry be damned !.oh my dear triangles, pyramids, and other geometric shapes ... your days of existing in plain sight are limited.	1
	mr. brown will invoke and christen you with deep symbolical (and potentially religious importance) if you are not careful.	1
	no longer can we ignore the obvious nazi implications in the swastika patterns which may be drawn on maps in many grid-like housing developments in the united states (if you use your imagination (and a pen)).	1
	no longer can we view a simple circle without reflecting on how it has been co-opted by the semi-secret sect of the shriners to reflect the similarity between the treatment of childhood illnesses and the struggles of sysiphus and his circular boulder of injustice.	1
	once again, with this tome, the wicked travesty of ancient, and fictional, secrecy is unearthed by the globe trotting detective / professor - dan brown - i mean robert langdon.	1
	i pray for the day when this fictional depiction of both literal and figurative 'underground' societies and meeting rooms is brought to light via the magic of hollywood (and tom hanks).	1
	as a member of many secret societies i found the book to be entertaining enough to read from front to back (in my secret underground lair).	1
	let the battles begin....yes, let the battles begin between the literary snobs and the low brows who just want to be entertained.	1
	in the comments to the current first listed review, someone points out that there is a huge difference between a great writer and a great story teller.	1
	brown is a great example of that difference.	1
	is he the best writer in the world?	1
	no.	1
	is anyone ever going to claim he's the next shakespeare?	1
	hardly.	1
	but those literary snobs seem to forget the purpose of most fiction stories of today isn't brilliant prose.	1
	it's entertainment.	1
	i know that what counts as entertainment is different to everyone.	1
	dan brown's equation for entertainment is great: emotional investment in characters, plus action that plays on that investment, plus a lot of fascinating research thrown in.	1
	i will definitely admit that there were things i didn't like.	1
	no book is perfect.	1
	the question is, do the things that annoy you detract from your entertainment enough to not read it?	1
	that answer is going to be different for everybody.	1
	for the literary snobs who can't get past that he used the phrase 'the skull cradled in his palms' three times in the prologue, yeah, you're going to have a hard time.	1
	(and even some of those people enjoyed it anyway.)	1
	for those of us who don't analyze that critically when wanting to read something fun, entertaining, and somewhat informative, it will be very enjoyable.	1
	what i liked most?	1
	it was a quick, entertaining read that also made me think.	1
	i really appreciated dan brown's view of the world.	1
	his take on religion, science and history is very open-minded and different than the average person.	1
	he's a smart man.	1
	i can't give examples, i don't want to spoil anything.	1
	dan brown had a tough time writing this book, you can tell.	1
	it is unbelievably hard to get all the interesting research he found in to one book without it becoming bogged down.	1
	i think he might have erred a little on the bogged down side.	1
	i felt like a little too much was thrown at me, but i also felt like it didn't have enough substance.	1
	i wanted more details of certain things, maybe less of others.	1
	one warning for brown fans: the beginning is a little slower than you expect from him.	1
	for pitty's sake, no one dies in the first chapter!	1
	recommended?	1
	yes.	1
	i don't think the writing is 'bad' (not the best is not the same as bad) and the majority of people will enjoy it.	1
	everyone except the literary snobs or purist hardcore academics.	1
	it just seems like those are the only people who take time to review...	1
	same story, different day....it's amazing to me that it's necessary for dan brown to continuously and insidiously find every excuse to ridicule and belittle christianity and faith.	1
	the overt theme in this book was how nothing in the bible is true.	1
	that all the biblical writings originated with mystical, ancient 'masters' who found enlightenment void of god and that anyone of individual faith, be it christianity, judaism, buddhism et al.	1
	are sorely unenlightened.	1
	troubling indeed because he's a talented writer and has quite the following.	1
	the book itself is a rehash of all his other novels.	1
	same premise, outline, theme and formula.	1
	some of his early works are well done but as of late, he seems to have turned into the proverbial 'dog with a bone' and he isn't letting go any time soon.	1
	pass on this one...      	1
	disappointing.this book is pretty boring and it was hard to finish.	1
	i was very disappointed as i was very excited when dan brown started writing again instead of making movies, which were not very good.	1
	i was hoping for something as good as the other books he has written.      	1
	awful!awful!	1
	awful!.buy this for your 8-year old if you like.	1
	but if your literary tastes go beyond that age don't bother.	1
	it is terrible---so bad i couldn't get beyond the first 200 pages.	1
	a total waste of time and money!!	1
	!      	1
	could not finish this book!.to be honest with you i really hated this book.	1
	well, what i read of it anyway.	1
	don't get me wrong.	1
	i think dan brown is a brilliant man.	1
	i've read all of his other books and found them both interesting and enlightening, but this is one book i really could not finish.	1
	for one thing there was nothing likable about any of the characters.	1
	i'm supposed to care about this old man who is kidnapped, but i really don't.	1
	plus i agree with another reviewer who stated that dan brown phoned this book in.	1
	it's almost as if he knew that no matter what he wrote it would be a best seller and that was all that mattered.....      	1
	that's it?.i guessed the location of the latest secret find in the first 20 pages.	1
	i didn't guess what it would turn out to be.	1
	suffice it to say, what?	1
	that's it?	1
	llllllaaaaammmmmeeeeee.	1
	sigh.      	1
	lost eurasian culture or lost symbol?.dan brown's books are formulaic enough that others anticipated this new book that uses freemasonry as a link to the past -- that past mangled and muddled by works like the lost symbol.	1
	i can sympathize with brown having to rework his formula so that the cottage industry that is parasitic on his work didn't abscond with it completely.	1
	but time would have been better spent learning the eurasian culture more fully.	1
	not doing that results in brown's books reinforcing the suppression of that culture by the monotheisms of the near east and the medieval apparatus of christianity in the west.	1
	as a result, brown's work is more damaging to a eurasian renaissance than helpful -- even when he supposedly supports such a rise of that culture.	1
	my own research and books (the order of the dragon, the white island and the black book, the biography of lucifer series) calls for such a renaissance, but with scientific, metaphysical and philosophic foundations from the far north traditions.	1
	the old texts are there, waiting to be used, but brown hasn't done that.	1
	he should study shiva more carefully, and he should read yuri stoyanov on the diver tradition, before ending his book with pontification about 'praise god.'	1
	the chillest message of his book is that one of the heroes, peter, is indistinguishable from the arch villain malakh (word play on the hebrew title for satan, the 'malak' of god; and failure to understand melak taus, the yezidi equivalent of the rebel angel of free thought).	1
	while malakh had a sense of ethics that finally drove him mad, peter has empty anguish that vaporizes quickly.	1
	that brown sends one to the christian hell is not a point in his favor, or the favor of the depths of this book.	1
	my only reluctant conclusion can be that this book, while raising important issues, confuses and damages the discussion -- becoming an indirect suppression in its own right.	1
	dr. colleen d. clements      	1
	maybe i'm jaded..maybe i'm jaded, but if i'm going to have a plot driven by mysterious symbols i surely would not let it all hinge on a sudoku puzzle.	1
	please.	1
	i thought his last book was a bit much with the opening scene in the louvre lasting way too long.	1
	in this one the u. s. capitol is the setting for just about half the book.	1
	suspense usually is driven by some dire consequence.	1
	in brown's book it is driven by the fact that some of today's leaders are masons!	1
	oh my god, masons like george washington and ben franklin?	1
	if anyone finds this out our country will be ripped apart.	1
	no our country will be ripped apart when the cia can run covert ops in the us as dan brown believes.	1
	the last time i checked it was the responsibility if the fbi.	1
	ah' who cares, it'll be # 1 for a while, then it will die unlike .... leave it at that.	1
	i won't even ruin the end because it's way too silly and obvious for anyone to think about for more than a moment.    	1
	caveat emptor....shameless rehash of previous books and boring to boot!.unfortunately the book is going to be a bestseller because of dan brown's previous books and the movie spin-offs.	1
	i wish i hadn't contributed to this by putting in a pre-publication order for my kindle.	1
	although dan brown has never been a great stylist, i admit i've enjoyed his previous books.	1
	so i can understand someone wanting to read this book, if only to be a part of a sociological phenomenon.	1
	but this current offering is nothing but a rehash....robert langdon is tricked into undertaking a quest to solve a mystery that requires his skill in symbology while working with a female companion, meeting cognescenti guides along the way, coming against true-believer villians, and finding meaning in architecture of famous buildings.	1
	the format is the same as the previous books:  very short chapters moving back and forth between characters and time and the plot slowing unfolds admixed with bomastic philosophizing with langdon playing sceptic.	1
	if your looking for an action novel, the action actually is over about 85% into the book.	1
	along the way, brown manages to make some interesting ideas really boring by putting them in condesending new age and pseudoscientific packaging.	1
	even the puzzles are pretty lame; the author even admits they are simple and obvious.	1
	well, maybe washington dc tourism will benefit.              	1
	hacking a dead idea!.the most dissapointing investment in a book  i've ever made.	1
	from  a pretty well crafted da vinci code, and digital fortress, the authors writing has degenerated to the point i believe the original manuscript for the lost symbol had to have been written in crayon.then edited by spell check.sorry mr. brown.who made you write this silly thing?      	1
	good grief dan, were you paid by the word?.i listened to this book on tape and was so glad i had other things to do while listening.	1
	aside from the dc and the freemasonry historical references, which i did find interesting initially, but repetitive and preachy, i think the rest was cliche: the villain always one step ahead, bloodthirsty, and almost invincible; the hero stumbling in the dark; the cia - now that actually, of everything in the book, surprised me in turning out to be the 'good guys' - though why couldn't they tell the hero at the start; and last and least the denouement - of course that's where it would be and what would be there...what a let down.  	1
	very disappointed.i was very disappointed in this book.	1
	read and loved the da vinci code but this one is so incredibly bad.	1
	you have to suspend belief about the plot and the cia's involvement.	1
	hope in another 6 years he comes up with a better book.       	1
	what a let down!.i have liked all the dan brown books i've read, but this one was huge disappointment.	1
	i'm interested in history, art and architecture, and that is why i liked the davinci code and angels and demons so much.	1
	this book however has very little interesting history and an enourmous 'so what' factor.	1
	the story builds and builds and then fizzles into a boring anthropology/philosophy lecture.	1
	i'm so mad i spent money on this book.	1
	don't waste your time with this one.       	1
	almost as good as davinci and angels.i received my copy of dan brown's the lost symbol from amazon yesterday, 9/15 in the afternoon.	1
	by 4:30 a.m. the following morning i had to stop at chapter 117 before my sleepless body forced my head to fall right into the lost symbol's pages.	1
	the lost symbol is just as captivating as all of brown's books:  davinci, angels, deception and digital...  most of the book is fast-paced and is comprised of short chapters that go back and forth between characters and events in a very thoughtful and interesting way.	1
	again, no different from mr. brown's other novels.	1
	there were a few points where i started to get a little bored with the text, but just as the very hint of boredom approached, it was quickly replaced with page turning anxiousness to skip ahead and find out the results of something provocative that had just happened.	1
	i really enjoyed the book, and i hope that mr. brown is quickly putting together his next work.	1
	there were two things about the book that were a little disappointing.	1
	doing my best not to include blatant spoilers here.	1
	one was the threat revealed that could compromise national security.	1
	although the characters from this aspect of the story were strong, i thought the actual threat itself was a bit weak.	1
	secondly, there was a moment in the book where i thought dan brown made a bold move that set the tone for his future books - steering off the path his last three have taken.	1
	instead, i was fooled.	1
	it's too bad - i would have liked to see brown return to novels that are more independent of his latest series - like, say, deception point or digital fortress.	1
	maybe he still will, although this series is incredibly popular and i'm sure the lost symbol will go the way of the movie world as well.	1
	so the theme and series is a cash cow for sure.	1
	all in all a great novel by dan brown.	1
	as great as his others - nooooooot quiiiiite, but very close for me.      	1
	gee, i really enjoyed it..wow, dan brown sure does know how to attract a tough reviewing crowd!	1
	but, i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed this latest novel of his.	1
	but, then again, i typically do enjoy thrillers, and almost all decent ones do follow a basic format that apparently offends some folks as not being 'real literature'.	1
	that format includes a really evil bad guy, good guys faced with a deadly crisis with potentially catastrophic results if it's not solved in time, less focus on character development than on the plot and action, and short cliff hanging chapters.	1
	yes, robin cook uses it.	1
	dean koontz uses it.	1
	david baldacci uses it.	1
	michael crichton used it.	1
	big thriller movies use it.	1
	and, just as in , dan brown uses it in this one.	1
	when combined with decent story-telling ability, a unique plot and theme, as well as some surprising twists, turns and revelations - it can make for an enjoyable, 'can't-it-down' page-turning fun, roller coaster ride of a read.	1
	it doesn't always happen, but it did for me with this one.	1
	brown reheats his own particular brand of this formula from the davinci code, which again places the smart 'nerdy' hero langdon (versus the oft used macho-ex-seal type) chasing an intelligent trail of historical clues to solve the do-or-die mystery.	1
	it's a format i enjoyed then, but was skeptical he could replicate into a uniquely, entertaining story (particularly, given the number of writers i've read since then, that have tried to do so, and failed.)	1
	but, he does it well.	1
	and,unlike a lot of even very enjoyable thrillers, i learned a lot along the way about the derivatives of everyday words, d.c. and some of it's monuments.	1
	bottom line: if you didn't like the davinci code or aren't really a fan of thrillers - odds are you're not going to like this one.	1
	if in particular, you don't like novels that take on the religious/science debate, or use a spin on historical or biblical references to create a fictional tale - than you're really not going to enjoy it.	1
	on the other hand, if you just enjoy a unique,fast-paced thinking-man hero thriller that keeps you turning the pages (and aren't who i just named) - than i think you'll enjoy this one.      	1
	far-fetched, predictable, and very repetitive.ok, so i know that the first two robert langdon novels weren't exactly easy to believe....but when i say 'far-fetched' i'm more referring to brown's explanations.	1
	he seems to really be reaching with a lot of the comparisons that he's making in this book.	1
	on top of that, he just feels the need to repeat the same argument over and over, until you feel like screaming, 'alright, i get it!'	1
	this is blatantly apparent towards the end of the book.	1
	brown's writing ability has never been spectacular, but at least with the da vinci code and angels and demons, you were so caught up in the plot and so busy turning pages, it was hard to notice.	1
	now, with the repetitive nature of this book, it becomes much more noticeable.	1
	as for the predictable comment....i'm not going to give anything away, but i will say that if you pay a little bit of attention to the way he words certain phrases in the book, you can see one of the big 'twists' in the end coming from a mile away.	1
	lastly, i was very disappointed in the ending of this book.	1
	with his last few books (i.e.	1
	the da vinci code), brown seemed to have found a way to leave the reader very satisfied after hundreds of pages of nonstop suspense.	1
	with this ending, i feel he has gone back to the feel of a c-list movie like in some of his earlier works (i.e.	1
	deception point).	1
	let's just hope this was the fluke in the robert langdon chain, because i really did enjoy the other 2 novels.      	1
	please!	1
	not one more inane stream of consciousness thought!.i'm sure it has been said but... on top of all that is mediocre in this book, i went  nearly crazy with the stream of consciousness asides.	1
	they were so obvious.	1
	they added nothing to plot development, empathizing with character, getting deeper insight, etc.	1
	just can't figure out why they were let in.	1
	help, can anyone clarify?       	1
	worst of the 3.the lost symbol is by far the worst of the 3 robert langdon books.	1
	the tragedies to the characters are resolved to easily (and to conveniently) and really, all in all, there's no real story here.	1
	no suspense.	1
	no drive.	1
	the book reads as more of an 'obligation' by dan brown to fulfill some need for himself and not for the reader, like a 'hashing out' of random ideas on a variety of notepads.	1
	there is far too much 'on the nose' historical/factual lecture from the characters too, and they just all seem to 'know it all'.	1
	i dare say ben gates is a better treasure hunter than langdon in this book.	1
	like the movies from brown's books, this one falls flat on it's face and it's too predicatible.	1
	the ending is premature and then drawn out over the course of chapters with the characters 'explaining' this and 'explaining' that and whatever.	1
	a yawner at best.	1
	there are very few moments where you're really wondering what is going on...with interest...where the story tightens up and grabs the reader, but they're so few and far between they're soon forgotten.	1
	to label this book a 'thriller' would be a rather dry and boring assault on all real thrillers out there.	1
	can't say i'll be waiting for the next langdon book.	1
	the character is lifeless and one-dimensional and knows far too much to be human (like a walking encyclopeadia of everything).      	1
	relies on formula and the suspensie build-up doesn't deliver....i have read all of the robert langdon installments of brown's work and while they have succeeded in giving me a decent amount of entertainment, i don't feel like i've ever really been awed.	1
	oh sure, the ending of the da vinci code was 'shocking', but at the end of the day it didn't rock my world.	1
	i think the reason for this, especially in the case of this latest installment, is that brown relies to heavily on the formula he's concocted to drive his plots along the way.	1
	moreover, it just isn't feasible to believe that this one simple college professor has such a wealth of knowledge that he can solve all the world's mysteries with very little help.	1
	in this novel more than others, langdon came off as highly pretentious and relatively unsympathetic.	1
	this also showed were in the minor characters who were introduced...  each one had a higher degree of knowledge than the next and by the end of the book it just felt like they were all trying to one-up each other.	1
	which leads me to the ending...  wow.	1
	without giving anything away, i'll just say this: it felt like brown knew he was about to miss a deadline and just said to himself, 'ok, i just spent 400 pages building up but now i need to find the quickest route from point a to point b.  oh, there it is.'	1
	there are hardly words that i can think of to describe how disappointed i was with the last 150 pages or so of this book.	1
	horrible!      	1
	tiresome plotline.with much anticipation, i dropped what i was reading to start the book.	1
	it started well and kept going down after that.	1
	the plot was very esoteric and gave me a headache trying to understand the physics of it all.	1
	the characters reminded me too much of the da vinci code.	1
	it got worse as it got along.	1
	he kept repeating himself as if to make sure the reader could understand.	1
	what i could understand did not need to be repeated.	1
	towards the middle i was reading faster to get to the end and when i did it was a bummer.	1
	the ending of the code was beautiful and haunting.	1
	i don't understand his obsession with pyramids.	1
	living in dc area (alexandria) i found his research into the area fun.	1
	he did his homework about the sites in and around dc, enough to make me visit sites i passed everyday without noticing.	1
	he certainly got alexandria right.	1
	unfortunately, that was the only thing i found fun.	1
	wait for the paperback; or better still, take it out of the library if you mus.       	1
	implausible peril from the start.the tale didn't work for me from line one.	1
	how is a reader to accept that a society, so secretive its members would sacrifice their lives before letting priceless knowledge fall into the wrong hands, could allow a newcomer into its uppermost ranks in exchange for a cash contribution?         	1
	wow, this boook is bad.i did enjoy da vinci code, and angels and demons was tolerable, but this new book by dan brown is horrible.	1
	a little google searching at the begining of it would have saved the main characters a lot of trouble.	1
	the writing is poor, the plot is just as bad.	1
	the main 'bad guy' is laughable.	1
	let's just take one example - the cia sends robert and katherine off to the house where her brother has supposedly been found.	1
	supposedly the cops are there.	1
	with all of the cia's vaunted technology (which they've been bragging about throughout the book) no one checked to see if the cops were actually there?	1
	and way too much of 'oh, of course, that's the answer!	1
	it's clear to see' but them not telling you what they saw for a few more pages.	1
	i am struggling to finish this book, but really felt like putting it down after the first few chapters... anne      	1
	it should be called lost time.this was nothing more than a verbose 'chase' book.	1
	they run around dc looking for a mystery.	1
	the killer is super rich, very strong, and exceedingly smart.	1
	there were no surprises, i want all the time i spent reading this drivel back.        	1
	plot twists were painfully obvious.having enjoyed both angels and demons and the da vinci code, i was looking forward to another intriguing thriller from dan brown.	1
	unfortunately what i got was formulatic plot with painfully obvious plot twists discovered even before midway through the book.	1
	there was absolutely nothing original about this story and the ending was ludicrous.	1
	why all the hoopla for such a so-what secret.	1
	and that in a nutshell is what is core problem with the book.	1
	you get to the secret revealed and your reaction is...so what.	1
	the masons created a whole intricate and elaborate myth to protect a secret that is...not really a secret?	1
	what??	1
	why don't i write a book about the rufifarians - a secret sect of some order who through a convoluted series of puzzles and maps and secrets keep a precious and ancient secret...and the ending reveals that...the secret is...water is refreshing.	1
	yes, the ending was that bad of a let down.	1
	do not waste your time on this drivel.	1
	if i could go negative stars i would.      	1
	has it been worth the wait?	1
	overall, yes..i don't think i can recall a book that has been as widely and thoroughly anticipated as the lost symbol by dan brown.	1
	i know, i know...that potter kid has a lot of fans who stood in line at midnight for the privilege of being the first on their block to possess the latest volume.	1
	but it has been six years since the da vinci code was published, and folks were overdue for the next installment.	1
	so here it is: the return of harvard's own symbologist robert langdon in roughly 500 pages of him in a battle of wits with a truly deranged villain played out against the backdrop of washington, d.c.  the lost symbol takes place over a period of 10 hours or so in the washington d.c. area, predominantly downtown.	1
	langdon, being somewhat unfamiliar with america's capital, is a fish out of water.	1
	his presence is the result of a request of his old friend, peter solomon, to make a last-minute address at a private gala presented by the smithsonian institution.	1
	what begins as an attempt to help a friend, however, becomes a race against time.	1
	langdon is forced to follow an enigmatic series of clues to obtain the solution to a puzzle that is believed to have the power to unleash a heretofore hidden and closely guarded secret.	1
	the guardians of this secret are the masons, an order that is both publicly known and shrouded in mystery.	1
	langdon follows an ancient, clandestine and bloody trail across washington, commencing with a grisly object displayed in the capitol building.	1
	while following the clues around the city, langdon is pursued by the cia, who seems bent on stopping him at any cost.	1
	the result is a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse as langdon and solomon's sister, katherine, chase down a series of codes and symbols, some familiar and some going back to the beginning of recorded history.	1
	and the strings of this deadly game are being pulled by the imposing mal'akh, a giant demon of a man who is truly deranged.	1
	langdon must use all of his skills and knowledge to stop mal'akh, prevent the death of his friend, peter, and foil a plan that culminates with the toppling of the united states government.	1
	as forces both old and new converge on one of washington's most unusual structures, the fate of many hangs in the balance as a madman's carefully calculated plan comes near success with only langdon --- in an uneasy partnership with one of the united states' most powerful agencies --- standing in his way.	1
	has it been worth the wait?	1
	overall, yes.	1
	but that's not to say that the book is without its shortcomings.	1
	for one, the lost symbol could easily have been a hundred pages shorter since it tends to drag occasionally, usually when brown shows his research hand a bit too much.	1
	and there is one segment between the climax and the ultimate conclusion where brown prattles on a bit too long.	1
	additionally, there are a couple of points where credibility is strained, not unlike what one might be inclined to believe watching an episode of '24.'	1
	i'm not sure how some of the characters couldn't figure out the identity of mal'akh, the imposing and frightening villain of the piece, a bit sooner.	1
	and there are a few moments where injuries are seemingly healed way too quickly, so everyone can move from a life-threatening situation to just hours later touring national monuments without a stop at a medical facility in between for a few days of rest and relaxation.	1
	you'll understand once you read the book.	1
	but be warned: after reading the lost symbol, it will be almost impossible to resist a long and leisurely trip to washington, d.c to visit the places that brown so skillfully weaves and elegantly describes throughout his narrative.	1
	he clearly did his research, and he enjoys sharing it with readers.	1
	although he vividly illustrates both the city and langdon's brilliance, the most riveting character is mal'akh, who becomes more frightening, bizarre, and yes, memorable as one delves more deeply into the novel.	1
	and while the lost symbol lacks some of the more controversial aspects of the da vinci code (the most powerful group in the book, the masons, are portrayed as good fellows here, and religion in general is attacked half-heartedly when attacked at all), it is doubtful that you'll ever look at a dollar bill or d.c. the same way again.	1
	--- reviewed by joe hartlaub      	1
	the symbol is what matters.i finished the book literally about 20 minutes ago and felt i had to say something about it.	1
	at first, i was rolling my eyes and thinking oh god (no pun intended!!)	1
	this is just the da vinci code repackaged!	1
	then i got to the climax of the book and said aloud 'no duh!!!'	1
	then i got to the end and i was so pleasantly surprised.	1
	the end actually changed my attitude towards what i thought was going to be a silly book.	1
	unlike the reviewer who said it was it was an anticlimactic ending, i felt it was thought provoking and possible.	1
	i say give the story line a chance because i believe the main thing in this story is the symbolism and not the crime.        	1
	more lost than symbolic.i like compulsive page-turners as much as anyone even if my idea of beach reading is jane austen or the original blockbuster novelist, dickens.	1
	i'll even confess to enjoying the film versions of brown's earlier blockbusters: they're undemanding and relatively fast-paced.	1
	but once again we the public are leaping like lemmings off a cliff with a book that speaks to the lowest common denominator in writing.	1
	yes, i've read it, hoping for the best, and found it as poorly written, speciously argued, and feebly constructed as the rest of brown's oeuvre.	1
	had anyone other than this billionaire author penned the lost symbol, it would languish at the bottom of some forgotten pile of unoriginal, uninspired and unpublished manuscripts.	1
	instead, brown will reap immense rewards while other authors and better books go un-championed.	1
	what about alan furst?	1
	he gets paris and the french right, and sets a wonderful mood.	1
	what about the late, great michael dibdin (recently rip'd)?	1
	he got italy--and america (his inspector, aurelio zen, is as lively as brown's 'symbologist' is deadening).	1
	furst and dibdin write/wrote beautifully, not to mention grammatically.	1
	for anyone who likes exquisite writing, true suspense and books that really should be made into films but never are, i would nominate the amazing sleeper i read a few months ago: paris city of night, by a little-known writer named david downie.	1
	talk about craft!	1
	paris city of night--and furst's or dibdin's many fine books--won't sell a million copies in a day, but perhaps they should.	1
	how could it be so bad and still be printed.it's da vinci code all over again, only badly written, badly edited, and really boring.	1
	save your money.      	1
	more like clancy every manuscript.some readers may be enthralled by brown's use of the tattoed freek that has wonder powers but it gets old in the story real quick.	1
	granted, brown writes to the academic crowd as they say but when you use the word esoteric in its main form and two or three variations 38 times in the first nineteen chapters, it wears on the reader.	1
	the viewing public is not william buckley wanna-bees, they really don't want to run to a dictionary after every page.	1
	readers of action thrillers want the story to flow, this one does not.	1
	langdon constantly corects his fellow characters by the use of 'actually, it really is,.......  ho hum.	1
	this will put you to sleep in five pages--especially when they start looking for the address in d.c  where the answer is supposed to be located.	1
	also, lets stay realistic, if langdon is sealed in his freeking vault, drowned with water and you can see him injest the water and then brown just leaves him there and goes on with the story---hey??	1
	langdon is dead-kaput, the hero dies  before the end.	1
	definately not as good as di /vinci.	1
	this is were we suggest that he (brown) is getting more like clancy---he may not be writing this--perhaps  fifteen writers meet each week with danny and put the next three chapters together???	1
	maybe?	1
	perhaps??	1
	all we need now from brown to really copy clancy is a video game to go with the story.      	1
	boring waste of time.is he kidding me.	1
	what an insult to my intelligence.	1
	pre ordered it and actually put down another book i was reading just to dive into the lost symbol.	1
	the plot twists if you can call them that seen a mile away.	1
	at one point ifelt like i was watching a bad horror movie and wanted to yell dont go to the house alone what an idiot.	1
	i always knew what was going to happen always figured out who the bad guy really was and oh yeah always knew what the special word was.	1
	duh.	1
	i will nver read anotther dan yawn i mean brown book..  you want to read  a brown book get deception point.       	1
	terrible!!!	1
	!.this book is absolutely terrible for all the same reasons that other readers have identified.	1
	it  was somewhat exciting in the beginning but there were many parts i had to skim through that were langdon and solomon spurting off a bunch of bs over and over again with no resolution in the end and no basis in reality whatsoever.	1
	one of the worst books i have ever read!      	1
	after a long anticipated wait, simply aweful!.to be honest i couldnt wait to get my hands on this book when i heard it was coming out.	1
	diligently picked up my copy on sept 15th and quickly began to read... first few chapters had me hooked almost picking up where we left off with langdon.	1
	as we progressed with the story line, it went from bad to worse till finally i couldnt wait to end the misery.	1
	i plowed through in agonizing pain, boring page after bland page.	1
	written with hollywood in mind, mr. brown tries to weave in unsuspected surprises, puzzles, and mysterious orders.	1
	in my opinion, he fails miserably to recreate the plots of da vinci code and a & d. he breeds the same lone bad guy, mentally twisted who torments langdon to unlock puzzles around the city - only difference here is the 'surprise' at the end is lame and ambiguous, hardly justifing the 'adventure' that i endured for the past two days!	1
	overall terrible book, a disappointing deviation from what was an otherwise 'good' trilogy.       	1
	boring and predictable with an ending plot twist that made me want to laugh.it seemed like dan brown did a lot of research on the masons and his entire desire with this book was to give you a history of this not so secret society.	1
	with that said, i kept reading to see if there was a big payoff in the end.	1
	i literally closed the book when i got to the page when they explain why the cia was involved.	1
	i couldn't read another page.	1
	spoiler alert(sort of)....when langdon learned why the cia was so concerned i nearly laughed out loud.	1
	please!!	1
	at least in his previous books he didn't think that the cover-up by the church was warranted, but in this he is just as worried as the cia that this news will get out.	1
	chaos!!!!	1
	a political scandal that would rock the entire foundation of the united states.	1
	please.	1
	i felt like a fool for not at least waiting for paperback version before i tried this book, or borrowing it from the library.	1
	better yet, just take a pass a read a good book.	1
	dan brown, you just made yourself a lot of money for a piece of garbage.      	1
	very entertaining.i enjoyed this book immensely.	1
	it was full of suspense and i couldn't put it down.	1
	the research was amazing and meticulously done.	1
	unlike some of the other reviewers, i didn't figure anything out, because i didn't want to.	1
	i went along for the ride and kept turning the pages.	1
	i think this is dan brown's best book to date.	1
	it is evident that because of his fame, he gained access to some places that most of us never knew existed.	1
	i always wondered what the masons were all about.	1
	whether he revealed any secrets or he made it up, it was a fascinating read.	1
	i want to go to washington for the inevitable ' lost symbol tour '.      	1
	jumps the shark.its light easy reading, its often interesting, and i do enjoy the roller coaster like thrill chase that is going on in the book...but be warned....in the last 100 of so pages, the book jumps the shark in a huge way.	1
	it was moving along nicely and then became completely ludicrous.	1
	still, a fun, decent enough read      	1
	atonement.for da vinci code fans suffering though dan brown's long hiatus, 'the lost symbol', while formulaic, will not disappoint.	1
	harvard professor robert langdon stays a lot closer to his cambridge home this time around, as he is lured to washington, dc, by old friend and mentor peter solomon, the ultra-wealthy head of the smithsonian institution.	1
	wasting little time to get the adrenaline flowing, solomon turns up kidnapped, leaving a grisly clue beneath the dome of the us capitol building.	1
	soon langdon scrambling for clues and playing hide-and-seek with a shadowy branch of the cia in a frenzied attempt to save his friend's life.	1
	as with 'da vinci' and 'angels and demons' before it, ancient symbology and historical minutia is the core around which brown spins the action, this time diving deep into the lore and secret rituals of the masons, and the connection between the masons and the us founding fathers.	1
	the masons are arguably the least understood and most commonly maligned 'secret' society in history, standard fare for conspiracy theorists and a seemingly inexhaustible stream of second-rate thrillers and b movies.	1
	but brown covers this delicate topic with an even hand, treating this venerable group with a revealing intelligence and due respect.	1
	this makes for a riveting page-turner crafted around an impossibly diabolical antagonist, a cleverly fiendish tattooed hulk who calls himself 'mal'akh.'	1
	rapid-fire chapters, a nicely done link between ancient wisdom and the arcane emerging field of science known as 'noetics', the study of the unhidden power of collective human thought, lead through a series of non-stop cliffhangers to a well hidden twist at the finish line.	1
	where the heretical theme of 'the da vinci code' infuriated many christian's, brown tones down the rhetoric here, striking a fair balance between the secular and the spiritual.	1
	in fact, and perhaps as appeasement to some of those he may have offended, there is a deeply spiritual element to 'lost symbol' that is thought provoking in topics ranging from the substance of the soul to the relevance and immortality of the bible.	1
	with enough conspiracy to keep the black helicopter crowd happy - including actual black helicopters - and some unabashed but enjoyable similarity to the 'national treasure' films add up for a fast, entertaining, and educational read.	1
	of course, it is not perfect.	1
	while langdon's 'brains over brawn' is a refreshing change to the typical 44-magnum-toting pop thriller protagonist, the thin, stereotyped characters and lame dialog are classic dan brown.	1
	the breakneck pace falters near the end, dragging on an overly long 60-plus pages after the true climax.	1
	and as brown has his own history of playing a bit loose with some of his facts, there is little doubt that parts of 'lost symbol' will frustrate the purists out there.	1
	but for the rest of us, this is a riveting page-turner and lots of fun - another brown thrill fest where plot and context trump the deficiencies, including all the ingredients for another wild bestseller that most will love while infuriating others who, as with da vinci code before it, will love to hate it. 	1
	maybe i'm missing something.......but does the cia (the major law enforcement agency in the plot) have authority in dc that it's denied in the rest of the country?	1
	yes, as we learn at the end, they have a vested interest, but cia agents/paramilitary units running amok through the streets and skies of dc, flashing their credentials and weapons to clear buildings and public areas?	1
	don't think so, even in the approx 12 hour period the book takes place.	1
	just one of the many plot holes and absurdities in the book.	1
	it was somewhat entertaining, but i'll read his next book for free at my favorite brick and mortar store, rather than spend good money.	1
	or wait a few months when the surplus goes on sale for less than a paperback.      	1
	good, but not his best....this book was faced pace and a great read- just like dan brown's other  four books.	1
	i would say however, that it was not my favorite of his books.	1
	if you are expecting it to be as good as 'the da vince code' or 'angels and demons' -it won't be.      	1
	a disappointment even with low expectations.i finished the lost symbol last night, and it exceeded my expectations for mediocrity.	1
	it's pretty hard to discuss a book that depends entirely on tricks to keep you reading and not end up with spoilers, but here goes.	1
	first, to borrow a silly comparison from one of the book's characters, what if the big secret the whole book is about were the recipe for coca cola?	1
	before you buy, think about it.	1
	imagine that the most powerful mason in the world, a man of unimaginable wealth, intelligence, and goodness, offers his irresponsible druggie son, as an 18th birthday present, the most precious secret item in the entire legendary masonic utility shed.	1
	yeah, that is the inconceivable event that sets things in motion.	1
	now imagine that the son, having chosen unimaginable wealth instead, ends up in a turkish prison for drug offenses, and does not think of using some of his unimaginable wealth (rather than dad's) to bribe his way out.	1
	still with me?	1
	now imagine that the nastiest steroid-mangled psycho on the planet manages to scam his way through all 33 initiation rituals of masonry (that's a few years of close scrutiny by some pretty picky folks) without anyone noticing that there's something, well, a little 'off' about him (such as, a wig, full body makeup to cover tattoos worthy of queequeg, a nasty --self-inflicted-- scar below his richard, and a tendency to get all wookie-eyed and babble about ascending to the plenastral neovoid).	1
	no problemo?	1
	ok, imagine that in spite of living through a bout with the illuminati and a firsthand encounter with the priory of sion, symbol specialist robert langdon is 'sceptical' about secret societies.	1
	i mean, i'm sceptical, but i haven't played footsie with the sang real or been hunted by illuminati assassins....  if you are still saying, 'let me at it!'	1
	i'll just offer one last bit of advice: the end of this book is the most appalling letdown, not just in terms of the suspense, but in terms of the integrity of the world of the novel, that i truly cannot imagine worse.	1
	it is, among other things, endlessly uplifting.	1
	the da vinci code was fun, like a bag of flavored potato chips or your own pint of cheap chocolate ice cream.	1
	the lost symbol is not fun.	1
	the characters are not just cardboard, they are outside the realm of possibility.	1
	the puzzles require reams of exposition, which means people run from swat teams while panting to each other, 'did you notice that there are 217 steps on this staircase?'	1
	to which their companion replies, 'yes, but you missed the really important thing about the steps!	1
	look!!!'	1
	[end of chapter; switch venues for a chapter]  contrary to the exasperated claims of some who didn't finish it but thought they knew where it was going, the book is absolutely not anti-mason; nor is it anti-christian.	1
	in fact, it's not really anti- much of anything.	1
	cia?	1
	o-o-o-o-ok!	1
	psychotic tattooed killer?	1
	hey, once you get to know him.... one mildly amusing thing: the mormons -- who do not take kindly to this sort of stuff -- do not figure at all in the book.	1
	they are only mentioned once, in a list.	1
	pretty amusing, when you consider that one of the key sentences in the book was the enigmatic last words of one jos.	1
	smith.	1
	trust us: this book reads like a really bad parody of a dan brown novel.	1
	and that wasn't much of a standard to shoot for.      	1
	entertaining reading.i did thoroughly enjoy reading this book.	1
	it was not the same degree of page turner as the prior two but it does hold your attention.	1
	if you think you are going to figure out all of the twists or many of the codes out ahead of time think again.	1
	the book did seem to hit its peak well before the end though.        	1
	meh.i found the book tedious.	1
	the writing is pedestrian, and has no elegance or interest, so i endured it just to discover the plot.	1
	there is exactly one well-turned phrase in the book.	1
	but the plot was tedious, too, because i knew two things would happen: first, the protagonists would escape every situation, no matter how dire; and two, the things we learned initially would change by the end.	1
	with those two factors, i had no reason to invest in the story, and found i was skipping the sections where langdon got in trouble--there was just no reason to bother reading it.	1
	the descriptions of places in washington, d.c., might be interesting if i lived there and knew of them.	1
	but to describe a place as typical, then later describe it as astounding, gets a bit old and makes me distrust the author.	1
	more skipped pages.	1
	i bought the kindle edition because of the hype.	1
	and that's all i got.      	1
	sleep deprivation!.ok...........not the same depth as da vinci code or angels & demons but far superior than digital fortress and deception point.	1
	this easy read left me much more interested in our own capital and with many points to ponder for some time.	1
	inspires further research.	1
	(wikipedia here i come) i am a huge fan of dan brown's writing style and welcome all his books.	1
	i read this tome way too fast.	1
	as a senior citizen, i like brown, ludlum, smith, sheldon, rowling, grisham, baldacci, etc - not necessarily in that order.	1
	i read to be entertained & moved and dan brown never disappoints.      	1
	don't waste your money!!	1
	!.a lot of people will say they'll wait for the movie or the dvd.	1
	i wasted my money on the book (kindle edition) and barely made it half way through.	1
	it's now residing in my list at amazon, maybe i'll get it back some day when i'm really bored....wait, i'd have to be really bored to do that.	1
	my recommendation would be..just forget you ever heard of the book, the movie can't be any better.      	1
	bad exposure or free advertising?.a year and a half ago a freemason friend of mine expressed concern about a rumor that dan brown was writing a book about the masons.	1
	he was worried that some of their secret rituals were going to be exposed to the public.	1
	i had forgotten all about that conversation until i was halfway through reading the lost symbol.	1
	then it dawned on me that my friend's concerns were legitimate.	1
	if you keep your eyes open there are innumerable places where the influence of freemasonry on early america is unquestionably prominent.	1
	in my home state of massachusetts the masons have built countless public buildings including hospitals and schools.	1
	there is a freemason society in every other town up here.	1
	while their numbers have dwindled, their history is permanently tied to that of the nation.	1
	so, should they fear this book?	1
	my answer is yes.	1
	plenty of stories have been written about the masons but none so prominently as this.	1
	none have had the far reaching impact of the conversations that will come from this novel or the possibility of it becoming a film.	1
	while the masons will never have anything to fear from most reasonable individuals, it is rather the new corporate/religiously driven dogma of political extremists who will try to use this information against their opponents should they have any links to the masons.	1
	our current political discourse is so brazen that nothing is left off the table.	1
	if we lose the freemasons from the ranks of those in public service, it would indeed be a damaging blow to our country.	1
	on the other hand, this book could be the boldest advertisement ever conceived for a society with secrets.	1
	it is quite possible that the unique descriptions of the masonic rituals are edgy enough to draw in a whole new generation of brothers (and sisters for the eastern star).	1
	maybe dan brown has reignited the organization that once made this nation great?	1
	all we can do is read what he created, watch how this plays out and hope for the best.      	1
	dan brown needed to visit dc before publishing this book..a was aghast to read that quite a bit of dan brown's geographical information is incorrect.	1
	brown's books are supposed to be based in a little fact.	1
	however, his credibility in this book is dashed with his inability to use google maps or visit the city prior to releasing this book.	1
	the amount of geographical inaccuracies in the first three chapters alone was exhausting.	1
	when flying from boston to dulles international airpot, it is highly unlikely that langdon would have flown by the washington monument.	1
	it is not thirty minutes from dulles to the capitol building.	1
	the trip is closer to an hour and a half.	1
	yes, while langdon would have felt a change on the road has he went over the memorial bridge, looking left would not have let him see the tidal basin or foggy bottom.	1
	looking left, he would have seen the roosevelt bridge, roosevelt island, georgetown just across the key bridge, and the national cathedral up on the hill.	1
	langdon would have had to look right to see the tidal basin, and the jefferson memorial, however, neither the tidal basin nor the jefferson memorial are viewable from the bridge as a result of the trees in the way.	1
	on that note, coming from dulles international airport, langdon's driver would have taken them down route 66, which automatically takes cars over a bridge and directly into the city.	1
	memorial bridge would have been out of the way for no reason.	1
	this was just in the first three chapters of the book.	1
	if you know your way around the dc region, this will be an aggravating read.      	1
	the power of the mind.	1
	welcome to the real world of mind over matter along with a heart racing scavenger hunt through our own washington dc.	1
	written as only dan brown can do, this book is filled with fascinating facts about our capital woven into an intriguing puzzle mystery.	1
	there is more to this then just a good adventure story.      	1
	dan brown's best book so far!.i enjoyed angels and demons, and the da vinci code, but the lost symbol kept me on edge through the whole book.	1
	the twists and turns were phenominal!!	1
	loved it!	1
	!      	1
	typical dan brown style.	1
	the lost symbol- found.	1
	dear mr. brown by page 200 the end was a forgone conclusion.what does the lost symbol and the princess bride what do they have in common?	1
	robert langdon the protoganist in the lost symbol and vizzini the criminal genius in the princess bride find every situation they are in 'inconceivable' at this point robert langdon has stared in other brown books and yet he find himself completed 'perplexed' to be in his current predicament.	1
	gimme a break.	1
	no plot spoilers but if you start to get an inkling of how the book is going to end (and i did by page 200) you pretty much can skip the rest of the book.	1
	no surprises no aha moments just a relentless plodding towards the inevitable that dan brown stretches because his publisher and editor would not dare shorten the work of their golden calf.	1
	the only bright spot in this book is the field of noetics and you can wiki that for free.	1
	as for dan brown please go back to writing entertaining books and leave the vanity of trying to create a movement to another svengali guru.  	1
	the lost symbol is the da vinci code.dan brown has basically rewritten the da vinci code and simply inserted masonic symbology for christian symbology.	1
	i found the mystery porton tiresome.	1
	been there, read that.	1
	i wish mr. brown would forget the mystery and simply write about symbology and noetics.	1
	i  found the chapters that focused on the symbols and noetics fascinating and, even life changing.      	1
	wow!	1
	hold your hat!.	1
	not as good as a&d; but still entertaining..it's not a literary masterpiece but i enjoyed the book.	1
	definitely learned quite a bit about the history of dc, various paintings, freemasons, etc.	1
	good read.      	1
	there are going to be a lot of disappointed fans out there!.as a follow-up to 'the da vinci code' and 'angels and demons', it almost goes without saying that 'the lost symbol' is going to be a runaway best-seller.	1
	nor does it take deep literary analysis to suggest that the plot involves symbols, codes, secret rituals, freemasonry, mysticism, religion, history and frantic chases from one secret location to another as symbologist robert langdon slowly unravels 'the' ultimate secret to lay it bare before dan brown's breathless readership.	1
	the plot, such as it is (and it doesn't even begin to compare with his previous efforts), tells the tale of mal'akh, a shadowy, bizarrely tattooed villain who seeks to unlock the wisdom of the ages guarded by the mason's greatest secrets.	1
	mal'akh kidnaps peter solomon, the secretary of the smithsonian institute, a billionaire and a 33rd degree freemason.	1
	using him as a hostage, mal'akh forces robert langdon to search for the clues that will unlock the code on the masonic pyramid which is presumably a map to the location of the wisdom that he seeks.	1
	as a thriller, 'the lost symbol' is pretty weak stuff - repetitive, over-written and melodramatic.	1
	it lacks the intensity, the passion, the drive, the pacing and, indeed, the controversy that understandably (and quite justifiably) drove 'the da vinci code' to the top of the best-seller lists.	1
	i might even go so far as to suggest that brown's focus on the christian bible (well, at least, the masonic interpretations of the bible) are a blatant apology to the fundamentalist christian groups that seemed to be so deeply offended by 'the da vinci code'.	1
	the real power and enjoyment of this novel rests in its non-fiction content and background - the interpretation of masonic philosophy, secrecy and rituals to a public that, by and large (myself included), has misunderstood the group for many years.	1
	i certainly wouldn't be rushing out to spend my money on a hard covered version of a novel that comes nowhere close to fulfilling the overblown expectations of hordes of dan brown's fans.	1
	but i certainly would sit back patiently, wait for the thousands of copies that will make their way into second hand shops and read it for the history, the philosophy and the interesting sidebars on scholarly interpretation of religious books such as the talmud, the bible or the koran.	1
	paul weiss	1
	i quit reading.......when langdon came back to life.	1
	i don't even care what the ending is.	1
	what a waste!	1
	!      	1
	thumbs down.way too much description and history.	1
	if i wanted to read history i would have chosen a different book.	1
	i skipped page after page trying to find some action.        	1
	i love it !.hey i love the book !	1
	i thought it was a page turner !	1
	it had some real facts that was nice to know and to look up .	1
	a lot of people griped about that but all the csi and others shows you are seeing on tv are based on a real story !	1
	a lot of books are being written by a  real life story ,just change in names,  towns etc !where brown does not do .	1
	i did not know there was a jefferson bible till i read his book !	1
	i did not know a lot of the places in dc he wrote about was there !	1
	which i plan on visting and i think it would be great to be able to see it and know some of this .	1
	the masons i knew about but i looked up some of his science i did not know about  and it was real interesting  and i order a few of there books .i like where they are comming form .	1
	i believe that its true you can focus your mind (like praying ) and it can happen !	1
	i traveled in mexico and met some indians there and they teach it in there schools .	1
	i saw them use there mind to rise a foot off the ground .	1
	the also could tell you who was comming around the block as we stood because as they explained to me they can use there mind to see a block are more away .	1
	i know ,it blew my mind .	1
	but i saw it with my own two eyes and since then i have been getting into a lot of meditations and yoga .	1
	it has open my eyes more to different ways of thinking .	1
	did not mean to get of into all of this .	1
	but i loved his books .	1
	he is a very good modern writer !	1
	thanks dan brown for writing this story !        	1
	enough with the masons!	1
	!.i was disappointed with dan brown this time.	1
	the lost symbol is so much like his previous books....the really strange villain, some unbelieveable situations, etc.	1
	it's more of a masonic tell-all, and if that's what you want, it will be an interesting read.	1
	i just think he could do much better.	1
	i almost didn't finish it as i found it boring.      	1
	a fun, adventurous ride.. it wasn't as good as either angels and demons, or the da vinci code.	1
	but good nonetheless.	1
	i fully appreciate other critiques.	1
	however, i took a lighthearted approach to the story, and allowed myself to enjoy the adventurous ride it offers.	1
	after all, it is not only a fictional novel, but a fantasy.	1
	it was most difficult to wrap all of the symbology, philosophy, theology, us history and dc geology into this story.	1
	i can understand where atheists, fundamentalists and neocons (who believe this is an exclusively  christian nation) would have qualms over the story.	1
	the book stands for the proposition that the 'one nation under god', is not about jesus christ, but god in the form of evolved human beings and co-creators.	1
	that's a stretch for many.	1
	dan brown did miss one very important theological point and symbol, however: the 'word' , according to hindus and buddhists is the vibrational energy of the universe.	1
	it is replicated in the chant of aum, or om.	1
	christianity believes  the 'word' was made flesh when the universal love (i.e.	1
	god) took form through jesus christ.	1
	but i can forgive brown for this oversight.	1
	the book could have been 100 pages shorter.	1
	and how the lead characters could do all they did at the end after all they went through during the previous 24 hours, is unimaginable; but it just goes to confirm that it is a fantasy.	1
	but is was a fun read.	1
	i also think it was written for a more juvenile audience than for high caliber literary critics.	1
	i give it 3 out of 5 stars.	1
	dan brown fan.	1
	lost symbol let down.i was let down, and by the end it made me some what angry to have been let down.	1
	or, perhaps, i don't like washington dc, and what i consider as too much religon.      	1
	the lost symbol.very disappointing.	1
	by far, the weakest of dan brown's books.	1
	for every five minutes of suspense, there were twenty minutes of boredom.	1
	a very weak plot and a very disappointing conclusion.      	1
	worth spending a few bucks on..the lost symbol is a good page turner.	1
	just don't dwell on too much of the depth.	1
	the plot seems a bit predictable, but well written.	1
	it took a while to get through this one, becasue i think that i was doing exactly what i said not to do (dwelling too much).	1
	probably would have been better to see on the big screen.	1
	even with my mixed emotions about the book, i think it is worth getting a copy if you can find it cheap enough.      	1
	disappointed.i found this book to be rambling discriptions.	1
	i enjoyed both the devinci code as well as angels and demons.	1
	the actual action in this book could probably be contained in about one hundred pages, the rest was fill.	1
	i felt it an effort to get something on the market for the money.	1
	i will have to think long and hard if i would read another of his books.      	1
	misses the mark completely.many authors have a formula that they repeat over and over with new themes, characters and locations.	1
	dan brown has 'worn out' his formula.	1
	the characters were not believable nor the supposed secret.	1
	do yourself a favor....skip this one.      	1
	the lost symbol a book like this is hard to find.the lost symbol is a captivating book full of codes, symbols, and ancient secrets.	1
	this is a thriller to remember.	1
	if you like an always moving, hair raisng story don't hesitate!	1
	this book is one of those books that are so good, and hard to find.	1
	this is a book you will never forget!      	1
	the lost symbol.as usual, dan brown holds our interest through a less than 24 hour time span of chase, intrigue, mayhem, total disruption of lives and complete surprise for the fantastic ending.	1
	this novel, in my estimation, is on a par with, or slightly exceeds his previous efforts.	1
	unfortunately, i read the book in less than two days so i will be required to wait for an indeterminant amount of time for his next novel.	1
	fantastic story-teller and one of my favorites.       	1
	i wonder.reading this excellent book made me wonder about the true meaning and practice of humanism, and how it has imprisoned the body in the soul.	1
	certainly the classic and christian ethical periods provided us with no guidance, but what direction did the enlightenment turn us towards?	1
	how can we formulate a contemporary ethical system from the concerns of the humanist doctrine?	1
	is there a possiblity for ethics in the modern world?	1
	i tried to contrast the authors viewpoints to some of these concerns, and it was interesting and challenging.	1
	i look forward to his next book.      	1
	can i give less than a one star?.this book is a real waste of time.	1
	a lot of rambling and stupidity.	1
	in most of the places it sounds like the paragraphs were cut out of some other book.	1
	no relvance to the story line.	1
	bad ending is nothing new to dan brown.	1
	at the end, this book has nothing.	1
	it feels empty.      	1
	read it as a parable.it took two days to hit me after reading the book.	1
	for those of you who didn't enjoy the book i suggest you re-think it: see it as a parable, which is exactly what the story is about.	1
	robert's chase down dark hallways etc.	1
	is symbolic to the message at the end, that our religious teachings are all parables and we are mis-reading them by looking in all the wrong places.      	1
	the best dan brown book yet!.after reading a few of the other reviews of dan brown's latest offering, the lost symbol, i was confused and began wondering if some of these people read the same book i did.	1
	in all honesty, i found it to be an incredible feat of thematic storytelling, blending all of the elements that made the davinci code such a sensational success with a riveting new tale centered in the capitol of the united states.	1
	brown's ability to seamlessly weave historical fact with a fictional tale that is so realistic that you find yourself questioning where the line actually is between what is true and what is invention.	1
	that ability is a rare talent that brown has obviously mastered in this most current work.	1
	written as a disconnected sequel to the davinci code, the lost symbol follows the indiana jones-like journey of robert langdon as he scours the land and landmarks of present-day washington d.c. in a rapidly accelerating quest to solve a mysterious masonic puzzle.	1
	it's fast-moving and, at times, simply amazing in the revelations that are uncovered; many of which are based in fact.	1
	the story itself is mesmerizing, although it does follow the same basic literary formula as brown's preceding works.	1
	however, that fact does not detract from the story in any way and, in fact, emphasizes brown's signature style.	1
	if you're a fan of his previous books (not the watered-down film versions), then you're sure to love this latest installment of the continuing adventures of robert langdon.	1
	regarding the negative reviews, i certainly respect the opinions of others, provided they explain their point of view and not just spit out some mindless blather about how 'it sucked' or 'it's just like the davinci code'.	1
	for the masses that enjoyed brown's previous work, the lost symbol is a clear winner.       	1
	the lost symbol.thhis is one of the best books i have ever read.	1
	it is exciting and action packed and keeps you interested from the first page to the last.	1
	it is a real page turner and i could not seem to be able to put it down, i had to read the whole book in only a couple of days.it had so much real information mixed in with the 'story line', that you had to wonder if it was real and not just fiction.i really loved it and highly recommend this book to anybody who loves a good read.      	1
	well...i'm glad i read this, but....yes...honestly...i'm glad i read this.	1
	in all likelihood, you will be too.dan brown writes little chapters you could almost read during the average red light at an intersection.they usually end with something like, 'and then he couldn't believe what he just saw!'	1
	or 'and then something really cool happened, but i'm not going to tell you until two chapters later!'	1
	you flip the page, and move on quickly.	1
	in this book, he exaggerates that tendency by telling the story in a '24'-like fashion.	1
	the events occur over one day.you won't linger on his elegant phrasing or sentence structure, because they're not.	1
	he's not a wit.	1
	his humor is mild; i like the line that google does not equal research.he's a simple story teller, and he keeps you continually 'hooked' with the plot twists and fascinating trivia.this is his style, love it or leave it.	1
	as a reader, you also will be lectured to, as well as being told a story.	1
	the former will irritate you more in this book than in his others, i feel.like most people, i got swept up in the da vinci frenzy, and enjoyed it.	1
	then i checked out angels, and was more impressed.	1
	angels was better than da vinci for me, and i don't think i'm alone there.if angels was his 'rome' book, and da vinci his 'paris' book, then this is his 'washington dc' book.	1
	the lost symbol was just a tad bit of a letdown; the ending wasn't the walk-off home run you wanted.	1
	maybe a good, solid double for me.i now know why you write 'sincerely' at the end of a letter, though.	1
	i think that's pretty cool.	1
	there's a lot of 'cool' stuff in here, but as a story, it doesn't feel completely thought out.	1
	there's a little of a 'is that it?'	1
	feeling after reading the final page.but does it really matter anymore?	1
	i know i'll be waiting for his next book just like a bazillion other folks out there...all the while looking at my dollar bills more carefully, etc.without wax,dr.	1
	mo      	1
	rehashed national treasure.th whole plot of this book sounds like it was lifted right from the movie national treasure, which itself was a silly b movie!!!	1
	i don't get what all the fuss is about over dan brown, his writing is far from great and his plots are very silly and his villians turn into paper tigers everytime.	1
	why the hype?	1
	?        	1
	i felt like it was a lecture and i was taking a class.i was a huge fan of the da vinci code and had a big expectation of this book and got it immediately when it came out.	1
	it was boring, perhaps the storyline is so similar to his other books starring robert langdon.	1
	while reading the book, i felt like i was back in school.	1
	i felt like i was being lectured to often times - a history of masons - if you will.	1
	i dozed off at one point.	1
	the characters were very likable but the antagonist's background was predictable for me.	1
	needless to say, the book did not live up to my expectation.	1
	thank goodness, i bought the kindle version (9.99) and not the actual book.         	1
	a painful read.i liked the first two langdon books.	1
	but, this is a painful read.	1
	it is as if dan brown tried his hardest to make this book the most complex one to date.	1
	but, because of his mediocre writing ability, it turned into a great big mess.	1
	the plot is so convoluted that by the time the full plot is revealed, you simply don't care anymore.	1
	unfortunately, when i buy a book, i have to finish it no matter how painful.	1
	and this was a very painful read.      	1
	the lost symbol...lukewarm.i think it has taken quite a few years for brown to finish the lost symbol and i do wonder just why it took so long.	1
	overall i found it to be a b- thriller (3 stars) and i'm being more than generous.	1
	if you read the da vinci code you will find that the lost symbol is very similiar except that it takes place in washington, d.c. and not in rome.	1
	harvard symbologist langdon is summoned to washington by his friend and encounters the dead hand pointing up to the rotunda.	1
	just like in da vinci, in fact the whole book uses the same formula and structure--although there is much more action.	1
	but it does get to be stupid with this 50 year old harvard professor doing his own stunts...c'mon the guy is definitely not special forces--he's a 50 year old harvard professor.	1
	very difficult to believe some of it.	1
	anyway, if you read da vinci code you can easily predict what is going to happen next and it does get pretty boring.	1
	it is a nice little read if you don't think about what you are reading.	1
	it's a thriller, not literature but brown's writing definitely needs a skilled editor to finesse his writing.	1
	i had to force myself to finish it.	1
	your mileage may vary, but i find this book way over-hyped.	1
	but, maybe if you are in a plane or a train or a bus with a few hours to kill--this is good entertainment.      	1
	its not that its a repeat, its that it stinks.i can't believe i got duped again.	1
	but i did and that is dan brown's unique talent, to just keep you coming back for more slop while he laughs all the way to the bank.	1
	the problem isn't that this is a formula book.	1
	i enjoy many series that are really just formula for the most part, such as the spenser novels, stephen king, etc.	1
	there's nothing wrong with sitting down every once in a while with something familiar, as long as its good.	1
	this just isn't good.	1
	the plot is just series of events, the secrets are boring to anyone with more than a passing familiarity with the subject, the characters are just cardboard avatars.	1
	this just is a bad book.	1
	don't be like me, be smart.	1
	don't waste your time.	1
	there's better airplane fare out there.      	1
	waste of time.poorly constructed tale of pseudo science meets phoney religion all wrapped in a thick layer of assumptive reasoning.	1
	badly written and waste of time and money.      	1
	shameful jibberish..dan brown's book, the lost symbol, is poorly written jibberish.	1
	it is obviously written to sell as a screenplay.	1
	the character development is lousy; the story line ridiculous; the explotation of the masonic order is outrageous, and it is shameful that brown is going to make millions off of this trash.      	1
	waste of time.warning : spoiler below the greatest treasure turns out to be a plain old masonic bible, copies of which can be gotten easily....and almost an entire family died for it.	1
	come on... 	1
	the masons are a spent force and the noetic's don't deserve publicity.the mason's are a spent force.	1
	i just couldn't get excited over a group that was prominent 100 years ago and is in steady decline.	1
	there must be some powerful organisation that is benevolent but maybe not.	1
	how about, world vision, the un, the world bank, big oil, big tobacco, the green movement.	1
	how about political correctness and islam?	1
	it's like some joker tried to write a thriller about the rise of communism!	1
	the noetics do not need any free publicity.	1
	the popularity of the secret and the alchemist show that there is an infinite supply of people happy to believe in lightweight nonsense.	1
	dan, you were supposed to be about paranoia and fear and you just went around giving some randoms more credibility than they deserve.	1
	what's more, i couldn't give a flying flee in a rolling down and out what happened to any of the characters.	1
	kill them all off for all i care.	1
	i want my $25 back.             	1
	time to move on mr. brown.same exhausted plot, same characters (some with different names), same mysteries.......i was hoping for langdon to finally die so we could move on.keep 'angels & demons'.	1
	sell the other two in your next garage sale.       	1
	d brown newest book lost symbol.	1
	superb.once i started reading it, it was hard to put it down.	1
	it contains a multitude of fascinating facts about history and our nation's foundation.        	1
	good fun thrill ride!.forget what all the 'wanna be' literary critics say to put down this book.	1
	it's just a fiction thriller that keeps you turning the pages wondering what's going to happen next.	1
	it's great for escaping reality.	1
	it's just plain good fiction.	1
	i don't care about the historical accuracy that some question.	1
	i just enjoyed the book for keeping my attention.	1
	hope the movie is just as fun.      	1
	brown.not nearly as good as the devinci code or his previous books.	1
	seemed to wander      	1
	didn't really live up to the hype.this book was typical dan brown fashion...lots of research, which can make it difficult to read and comprehend at times, page-turning thriller occasionally, but overall, it didn't quite live up to the hype as the sequel to the davinci code.      	1
	this is my last dan brown book.the only reason i give this book 2 stars is because it is a page-turner at times and i learned some interesting things about washington, d.c. most of the time, though, the events in the book seem implausible and then it ends with a lecture.	1
	i really hate that.      	1
	if i could just........get past page 38. the first 10 pages or so were great.	1
	i read the preview and purchased the book.	1
	unfortunately, i'm still on page 38 and have lost my motivation.	1
	now that i've read some of the reviews, i wonder if i'll ever get through it.	1
	hmmmmmm, what happened to all the great writers?      	1
	somewhat disappointing.the premise seemed far-fetched and not as realistic as i expected from brown's other novels, all of which i read and enjoyed more than this one.	1
	the plot twists and suspense seemed forced at times and not enjoyable.	1
	still, he is a good story-teller and researches his material well.	1
	some of the characters are amusingly described, if not attractive people.	1
	on balance, it was worthwhile buying and reading, even if it's not on par with his other work.      	1
	the lost symbol.i found this book to be very engrossing.	1
	it was hard to put down.	1
	the book had numerous details about the masons, the u.s. capitol, etc.	1
	the ending was a complete surprise.      	1
	great book!.this book is, as usual, another novel filled with twists and turns and a great deal of historical fact and fiction in an exciting mix.	1
	not one you can't put down but one you will look forward to returning to.      	1
	entertaining.i thought the book was very entertaining.	1
	it wasn't the most fantastic thing i've ever read, but it kept me turning pages and had a good plot and i didn't want to put it down.	1
	i would recommend reading if you enjoyed dan brown's other books.      	1
	dan brown's the lost symbol.this was a typical dan brown book, it started off sort of slow and then picked up.	1
	hard to put this book down!.this is an excellent novel.	1
	i like dan brown and his style of writing.	1
	i never realized our own country, the united states of america, had such an interesting and mysterious history.        	1
	it was ok....but not great.one improvement over 'the da vinci code' was that the puzzles were actually pretty arcane and not easily solved at first glance by anyone except the brilliant dr. langdon.on the downside, there is an unecessary amount of location descriptions and the evil nutcase mal'ack is just ridiculous.it's clever, but a bit of a slog, and there are some plot twists that are just annoying and needlessly complex.      	1
	i  couldn't put it down!.i read dan brown's book in less than a day.	1
	i seriously couldn't put it down.	1
	it held me spell-bound until the last page.                      	1
	best so far.the story is very good, believable hero again and interesting characters but i am amazed that he bring very fresh ideas and leave me wondering about things hidden in plain sight that astound and challenge my presumptions.       	1
	average book.i read the da vincci code and liked it very much.	1
	i then borrowed from the library angels and demons and liked it very much as well.	1
	however, the lost symbol was disappointing!	1
	i wouldn't recommend buying it.	1
	actually, i am glad i borrowed it from the library and did not spend any money on it.	1
	you can try doing the same.      	1
	inspired!.if you are a fan of dan brown's books, this will not disappoint.	1
	fast paced, fun read.	1
	looking forward to the next book by this talented author.      	1
	not up to par.not the page-turning thriller we are used to .	1
	the story line seems contrived.	1
	and the main focus of the book seems to be espousing the authors religious viewpoint.	1
	i skimmed over the last chapter, the action was over and the rest was just more dribble.      	1
	not good.	1
	really..this one was a stretch...like an artist trying to make lightening strike thrice.	1
	where deception point was a nice turn, this seems like it's looking backwards, not new.	1
	lacks any real eureka!	1
	moment.	1
	you would be better re-reading angels or da vinci.	1
	and the ending was awful.      	1
	dan brown's old books shined up and sold again.there is nothing in this book new or different than angels and demons or da vinci code.	1
	he should be a little ashamed to charge people for this story still one more time.	1
	it's not necessarily a bad book - just the same story again.      	1
	meaningful, fascinating.the lost symbol is a fitting followup to angels and demons and the davinci code.	1
	it share with previous books all the elements of ancient secrets, a scavenger hunt through history, loathsome villians, and cliff-hanger transitions (though, thankfully the lost symbol cliff-hangers are not so annoying, but rather help the pace of story-telling.	1
	i really like where the story ends up with a world of possibility wide open to human potential.	1
	the seeds were planted early in the story and find ample development and realization in the epilogue.	1
	i enjoyed the several days in the world of intrigue dan brown created.      	1
	the lost symbol.	1
	very fast  moving story .	1
	good plot book should have ended with sons death  the last two chapters very slow let  down                                                                                                                       mike hoplight      sanborn ny      	1
	slow going.was hoping for more.	1
	for some reason - maybe to increase page count - brown felt it necessary to go into excruciating detail about the history of everything.	1
	in doing so, he lost the momentum of the story and totally bored me.	1
	the action scenes were good but far and inbetween... if only he could have cut out about 100 pages, it may have been a good read.      	1
	a let down.i've read all of dan brown's books and i read most of them before he was famous for da vinci.	1
	i wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing the latest novel.	1
	don't get me wrong, it's an exciting well paced read.	1
	my problem with the book is i've read the plot before.	1
	the only thing that changed was some of the characters, plot location, and a different symbol mystery.	1
	otherwise it was very predictable.      	1
	its a dan brown novel.for those who haven't noticed, mr brown writes every novel approximately the same way.	1
	take specifics out and the plot lines would be identical.	1
	this book is no different.	1
	that having been said, like all other brown books, this one is fun to read and contains some surprising levels of complexity.        	1
	why to not rush creativity.	1
	this book is proof you cannot rush creativity.	1
	i'll blame the contract forced upon an art form.	1
	the concept was great, the writing lacked a true novel length storyline and any passion we read within the previous books      	1
	nothing but hollywood.it's a disappointment.	1
	dan brown sold his soul to hollywood...that's all i have to say      	1
	anti-climatic.the book was very interesting but it should have ended about 3 chapters sooner.	1
	his attempts at closure and explanations fell short and a bit of a stretch and worse... disappointing.	1
	not his best work.        	1
	no longer a fan.i've read all of dan browns books and enjoyed them all.	1
	unfortunately i believe this is the last i'll read.	1
	it was predictable and formula driven.	1
	his previous books were smart and believable, this was not.	1
	i would not recommend this to any of his fans.      	1
	m'eh.was it bad?	1
	no.	1
	was it good?	1
	no.	1
	the story is written around interesting information about d.c. as opposed to adding interesting information into a good story.	1
	the ending seemed as though it had nothing to do with the rest of the story.	1
	definately the worst of all the books he made.	1
	i would give it 2.5 stars if i could.        	1
	could be 50 pages less.typical dan brown with lots of twist and turns.	1
	pure escapism as a novel should be.	1
	tells interesting things about dc which visitors to dc may be able to relate to.	1
	but story should have ended 50 pages before it did as the last 50 pages is total rubbish ramblings      	1
	not better than some of his other books.i was a bit dissapointed with the lost symbol and that is mainly because it was more predictable than dan browns previous books and the ending sucked.	1
	i was hoping it would blow me away like the davinci code or digital fortress, but i was sorely dissapointed.	1
	i am not saying its a terrible book, i just do not think it lived up to the hype.	1
	read it if you like dan brown but not a must read.      	1
	extremely disappointing.the book started out with a great story, but descended into a truly predictable, boring and disappointing ending.      	1
	was wuite surprised.having read 'angels & demons' and 'the da vinci code' i knew what i was getting myself in for.	1
	sort of.	1
	i found this book to be along the same lines as 'a & d' as i wanted to stay up all night reading it and not wanting to put it down.       	1
	storyrules.the book felt more like a rehash of the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	about half way through the book i was bored and felt a bit cheated that the author seemed to put himself on auto-pilot.      	1
	excellent.i found the book a little dry in the beginning but that soon changed and i found i couldn't book the book down until i finished it.	1
	i thought i had the characters figured out; i was wrong becasue the ending took me by surprise.            	1
	espantoso !!	1
	!.extremadamente largo, con mucho relleno absolutamente inutil.	1
	un intento por vender un nuevo libro a costa de incautos lectores atraidos por seguir algo del misterio y la magia de anteriores libros.	1
	realmente lamentable, quizas el 30% del libro es charlataneria, y como gran finale, un desastrozo desenlace.	1
	mi consejo, no lo compre      	1
	dan brown writes a good story.another robert langdon story.	1
	i like all the references to the symbolism found in the washington dc area.	1
	you'll be surprised during part of the story.      	1
	decent read.da vinci code is a much better read.	1
	certain parts dragged on and found myself wanting to skip to the end on a couple of occassions.	1
	its decent not great.      	1
	another dan brown book.this is another dan brown book, if you do not like how he writes or how he writes, then do not buy it.	1
	other than that he is great at taking things that do have some facts and make them seem so much more than what they really are.	1
	also this was great reading on the kindle.	1
	i could not put the book down after robert langdon made it to the capital building.       	1
	ok.not as good as angels and demons or da vinci code but worth the read.       	1
	rubbish built on prior success.this was a meaningless formulaic attempt to live off the success of prior works.	1
	it is a terrible read and is horribly predictable.	1
	save your $ if you have to experience it for yourself and rent it from the library.      	1
	entertaining.started off really great, and had a very entertaining pace.	1
	i thought it was a good read.	1
	a bit disappointing at the end.	1
	the author kept leading the reader to believe there was some huge mystery to be solved, and kept dangling the carrot.	1
	but the carrot ended up being somewhat unsatisfying, which is why i gave it 4 stars.      	1
	good, suspenseful read.it doesn't quite meet the high standards set by my favorite, 'angels & demons,' but it's a fun and suspenseful read.	1
	definitely recommend it.      	1
	thanks awfully, mr. brown... emphasis on awful..the rating and title say it all - this was the worst book i've read in years.	1
	a complete waste of my limited funds for books.	1
	i only wish i could force mr. brown to return my money.      	1
	exciting from start to finish.this is a book that you do not want to put down.	1
	some parts you can guess at what the author is trying to hide but several sections did suprise me.	1
	aftet reading this book im going to dc to take a look at the sites.      	1
	subpar.mediocre plot, forgettable characters, an underwhelming return for dan brown.	1
	you'd think a six year effort could produce better results.	1
	i like the robert langdon character and enjoyed the previous two novels; if brown writes another i hope he goes back to europe and delves more into its history.      	1
	very enjoyable read..i thoroughly enjoyed the lost symbol.	1
	this book was reviewed rather harshly, i believe.	1
	it's not great literary fiction, but then you don't pick up dan brown expecting a.s. byatt.	1
	it's a brisk and enjoyable read and makes me want to visit washington d.c. again.	1
	overall, i would say that this novel is not as good as the davinci code but better than angels and demons.	1
	pick this one up and enjoy!      	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown..i was very excited to read this book.	1
	unfortunately it was produced to generate profit without botherig with a real story.	1
	the ending went on forever in a religious rant totally disconected from the plot.	1
	no more dan brown stories for me without reading a few reviews.      	1
	stretching for material.while this book had an amazing plot, suspense, action, and intrigue, the ending fell short.	1
	it seemed as if dan brown felt his book was getting too long.	1
	the book climaxed and ended within what seemed was a matter of minutes.	1
	i was disappointed in the ending, however the rest of the book was fantastic.      	1
	typical dan brown novel.the lost symbol is, in my opinion, very much like dan brown's two previous books featuring the character of robert langdon.	1
	i could spew out a string of complaints about brown's views as well as his writing quirks; however, i still find myself devouring everything he has published.	1
	count on this book to be frustrating at points but always engrossing.         	1
	almost boring.i enjoyed reading about masonic and washington dc history, but didn't think the over all plot was very exciting.	1
	the ending was a total let down.       	1
	not sure what the fuss is about.average plot, average writing, average character development, average book.	1
	not sure what the fuss is about...      	1
	fun read.the book was a fun read, it had it's moments of adventure and revelation, however i will say i would rate this my least favorite among the da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	i was hoping for a bigger payoff towards the end of the book, it lead me to think there was something amazing that would happen and it never occurred.   	1
	tedious.how many times does robert langdon have to exclaim,'it's just a myth.'	1
	and then have that refuted?	1
	i grew tired of the repetition.       	1
	entertaining but long winded.i enjoyed this book but feel the book would have benefitted from some thinning.	1
	at times the flow of the story is slowed by the authors tendency to repeat himself.	1
	overall it is worth reading but is not as good as 'angels and demons.'	1
	page turner, but getting old.brown managed to write another suspenseful, easy-to-get-involved-in thriller, but the schtick is also getting a bit old.	1
	i found some of the action in this book even more hard to believe than in his previous books.	1
	i think he's on the decline, unfortunately.      	1
	good read.this is a good book, dont know why all the negative so-so reviews.	1
	great detail, and really interesting facts about our nations history.       	1
	worst read of 2009.all the pre-release hype influenced me to buy the lost symbol the day it was released.	1
	after an interesting and inviting start, the story plunged rapidly into an incredulous and predictable yarn, clearly written with 'action movie' in mind.	1
	as a novel goes the story lacks all the elements to make it a good read for an adult who appreciates being taken on a journey that is credible, interesting and suspenseful.	1
	this is my last dan brown book.      	1
	not worth it.it did not live up to my expectations.	1
	more deception point than angels and demons...      	1
	just disappointed..sorry to say but i actually expected better.	1
	it was a fast easy read though.      	1
	not all that much happens.before i read it i thought it was just going to be a rip off of 'national treasure' (masons in washington dc).	1
	it is a good read, but it is easy to see why dan really didn't sell all that many books until 'da vinci code'.      	1
	significantly less satisfying than his previous two....i will admit that i enjoyed the premise of this novel and even enjoyed the writing up until a certain point.	1
	however, the ancient treasure hunting that we hoped for took a backseat to scientific discovery.	1
	from that point on, book became a bit too outlandish and the build up for the massive discovery gave way to a seriously disappointing ending.	1
	i had hoped for a da vinci code/national treasure hybrid, but was left very disappointed.       	1
	worst dan brown yet.i have always enjoyed a good dan brown book when i need light reading.	1
	i was pretty excited for this one.	1
	i read it in a couple days and was seriously disappointed.	1
	the first three fourths of the book is really fun... basically the same as every other dan brown, but that can be fun.	1
	the last fourth was horrible.	1
	the ending is bad and the 'secret' is sooo lame.	1
	it wrecked almost the whole novel for me.	1
	hopefully next time he will do better.      	1
	tedious.whew!	1
	i'm glad that's over with.	1
	after the davinci code which i read three times, this was a complete fizzle.	1
	interesting facts about d.c. and our country's founding, but couldn't maintain my interest in reading about it.       	1
	a great nancy drew novel.this novel is written like a tennage mystery novel with lots of 'oh my gosh' and shocked surprise parts.	1
	the author seems to like ending a paragraph with a seeming enormous discovery of some incredible find that turns out to be just another cryptic symbol that leads on towards some unknown unfathomable conclusion.	1
	after the 6th or 7th 'he looked with horror and shock at what was revealed', it gets tiresome, since there really was no reason for the horror or the shock.      	1
	on suspending disbelief.dan brown has really slipped on this one.	1
	an absurd story which pushes our willingness to suspend disbelief beyond any reasonable limits.	1
	it was indeed a page turner, but i was turning pages in large part because i couldn't believe how inane the story was.	1
	even then, it was clear that the 'obelisk surprise' was not going to be a surprise to anyone but robert langdon.	1
	what a letdown!         	1
	satisfying, at long last.while as a novel it did not create the crackling excitement of davinci code or angels & demons, its captivating esoteric themes and ultimately profound theses are far more impactful and inspiring to me than those in his previous novels.	1
	highly recommended.      	1
	a decent read.not a bad effort, but it requires an even greater suspension of disbelief than his other books.	1
	beyond the usual anti-god stuff which i don`t like, the noetic science angle is pretty out-there.          	1
	interesting.this book lived up to dan brown's reputation.	1
	the story wants you to keep reading and finding out about real historical events.	1
	the last chapter is great.the book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.      	1
	good start - lame ending.it had me going until about the middle, then suddenly the whole thing just falls apart and in the end you are left wondering why did he even write the book.	1
	the ending is so dumb, all these people are killed and for what - a mytar and a bible.	1
	please, national treasure was better.	1
	if your thinking of reading it - don't.      	1
	page turner  - but flat ending.while i enjoyed most of the book, i got weary reading it torwards the end.	1
	i felt the author was leading up to a huge, earth shaking climax; however, the ending was flat and lacked substance.        	1
	is the lost symbol a good book for you?	1
	would it make a good gift?.	1
	huge disappointment.not a good read and i can not imagine it as a film...liked his other books and when made into films were good which is hard to do with a book that detailed.	1
	i doubt this could even be made into a film unless drasticly changed and that is not the point of a book made into a good film is it?i say save your dosh .....sorry mr. brown      	1
	2/3 done, should i finish it?.had great expectation for this book which i've waited so long for.	1
	i'm no historic/science buff but i know when some ideas sound smart or just down right boring.	1
	i loved angels & demons and da vinci code.	1
	in tls, langdon is not acting like a brilliant expect that he was and i'm frustrated with the plot development and lack of good 'mental floss' tidbits to impress me.	1
	i'm 70% through but i'm dragging to finish because it doesn't look like it will have an amazing ending...      	1
	no text-to-speech?.i was all set to buy this book this evening on the recommendation from a friend when i noticed that text-to-speech is not enabled.	1
	yes, a lost sale.	1
	my eyesight isn't that great and i sometimes like to listen to books while driving home from work, but obviously i can't read and drive.      	1
	worst dan brown book.the most likely source of this books crappiness is that brown chose to focus on the rather well known freemasons instead of some group that is lessin the mainstream.	1
	add the tired unbelievable robert langdon and the whole thing just dissolves into complete gibberish.	1
	since when is harvard symbologist a remotely believablejob title.....brown needs a new schtick forhis next book.      	1
	page turner.enjoyed the book!	1
	however, as in the de vinci code, i had a difficult time with some of his physical feats that he places his characters into.	1
	sometimes the actions require unnatural or unbelievable human endurance that defy logic.	1
	not as good as the others, but still interesting..while this book wasn't anything epic, it was still a fun book to read.	1
	this book is the third best out of the three langdon books, but considering i really liked the first two, it's not saying much that it wasn't as good.	1
	there was nothing in this book that blew my mind like the previous two, but overall, i wasn't disappointed when i finished the book.       	1
	lost symbol.this book was terrible.	1
	it was off to a bad start, however i have enjoyed his other books so i hung in there.	1
	he spent so much time trying to impress with his knowledge i think he forgot he was writing an actual book.	1
	please hollywood do not make a film from this piece of junk.	1
	don't waste your money.      	1
	highly overrated writer..an in depth overview of secret societies rendering them immature and cultish.	1
	that part is good, however, mr. brown loves intensity and overdoes drama without true character development.	1
	no one really cares what happens to anyone of them, and in a movie, play, or book, i like to be able to identify with at least someone.      	1
	same old...same old....i thoroughly enjoyed 'angels & demons' and enjoyed 'davinci code', but have to say that i liked 'lost symbol'.	1
	it was another quick read by dan brown, but throughout the book i kept having flashbacks of the previous two books.	1
	brown's writing is easy reading and does come with suspense, but when i finished the book i felt neutral...nothing special here.	1
	enjoyable read.the lost symbol is a good follow-up to the code.	1
	while not his best work, it is enjoyable and fun to learn about aspects of this country's history and washington dc.        	1
	the lost symbol.the book was very detailed and explained alot about masonry symbols.	1
	the ending was surprising with a little twist here and there and i was left with a sense of wanting more or wanting the story to continue.	1
	it was a little long but the author gave you alot to think about.	1
	i will be continuing to do research on the many masonic words and symbols as described in the book to gain a better understanding on the mysterious legends and facts surrounding the masonry as it fits in the washington area.      	1
	blah, blah, blah.this is one of the most boring books i've ever read.	1
	ther author kept digressing from the story with facts that were barely connected.	1
	i found the book preachy and trite, using all kinds of gimmicks, but in the end what is the lost symbol?	1
	no more dan brown for me!      	1
	yes, it's dumb....but it's a fun page-turner..pros:fun locationsamusing twistshistorical bits of information cons:characters are mercilessly ignorant/stupidthe ending takes way too long to wrap up      	1
	lost symbol.great book, it was not as good as angels and demons, or the danvi code but a good read      	1
	the lost symbol.not as good as angel & demons or the davinci code-- don't believe it lived up to all the hype.	1
	obviously written for a movie screen play.	1
	think dan brown is slipping.      	1
	dan brown writes another hit.this book is a real page turner - dan brown writes an exciting novel that takes you on a wild ride thru our nations capital - great read      	1
	good until the end, then falls a bit short of expectations.fun to read, exciting for 80% of the book, but last 20% gets rather tiresome and boring.	1
	but, all in all, it was fun to read... just don't expect that it will end strong.      	1
	great read.i enjoyed this book as much as, if not more, that his previous  novels.	1
	if there is a flaw in the book it is that he made some of the characters implausible.	1
	the historical background was fascinating.	1
	here's hoping he writes another one.        	1
	retread.if you have read the previous two novels, do not waste your time with this one.	1
	a very big dissappointment.      	1
	intriguing!.	1
	'the author of the da vinci code is at the top of the best sellers list again this time telling an intriguing story of free masons and mathematics in washington, d.c.'      	1
	not original.the lost symbol carried an identical storyline as the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	the same basic idea of langdon and an attractive female counterpart trying to solve an ancient mystry, while be chases was replayed once again.	1
	i was not impressed and found the final 40 pages of the book almost painful to get through.        	1
	can i get the time back i spent reading this book?.this book was not only a waste of my limited resources.it was also a waste of time i could never get back.       	1
	least favorite brown book.i found the ending very tedious and boring to read.	1
	angels and demons was by far the best of his books.      	1
	disapointment unfortunately.i have read most of his books...and i must say after deception point; this is the second disappointment.	1
	after reading about 1/3'rd of it you start wondering why you continue to read...'the ancient mysteries of the pyramid' is repeated so much that you come to a point where it does not matter any more...plus it is more like a screenplay then a story...i am sorry; but i did not find any creativity in it..      	1
	not what i had expected from dan brown.this book does not live up to the dan brown 'hype'.	1
	it had some very interesting passages, but overall left me desiring more.	1
	'lost symbol' had some very captivating chapters, but the conclusion was a little disappointing.	1
	i expected more from dan brown.	1
	it seemed as if he was running out of conspiracy secrets ;)      	1
	a page turner for the wrong reasons.this book really wasn't worth the wait or hype.	1
	it, quite simply, is a formulaic attempt at writing another 'da vinci code'.	1
	i find myself turning many pages for all the wrong reasons: just to get through the drivel about the bad guy and the endless, and sometimes pointless, explanations about the masons and their symbols.	1
	you know a book has problems when you can turn 5 pages, start reading again and not have missed a thing of interest.      	1
	don't wast your money and time.....the printing and binding of this book is very good, which worth one stars.	1
	otherwise, i consider this book a huge waste of money and time.	1
	poor writing, poor story with very bad logic.       	1
	politically correct.the previous books by dan brown had a more provocative tone.	1
	in this one everyone is nice and means well (expect for 1 character 100% evil).	1
	for me it lost the edge and is trying to please everyone.	1
	still it is a good read, the plot moves fast.	1
	unfortunately i guessed the end in the beginning of the book, and i don't even know washington dc that well.      	1
	it was the davinci code, but not a well done.this felt like the davinci code, except it was set in the us.	1
	felt like the same formula, just replayed.	1
	i was bored, and disappointed...      	1
	okay book.it was just that.	1
	okay.	1
	entertaining, but not must read like angels and demons or davinci code.	1
	it was not blockbuster, but it wasnt bad either.	1
	guessed the twist well in advance so what can i say?	1
	just read til the end to do so.	1
	neat and tidy ending but nothing mind numbing or world altering.	1
	just ok.  buy electronically or wait for paperback.      	1
	mariane.i enjoy dan brown's books but the lost symbol had alot of unnecessary reading in it that could have been omitted.	1
	it was, however, interesting and held my interest to the end.	1
	the professor in symbolism however, came off a bit short in other areas which detracted from his overall level of intelligence and i like to recognize him as having 'smarts' = to the general populace...will still look forward to brown's next book!      	1
	so bored i got on to write review before finished.i am so bored with this book that although i have less than 100 pages to go, i had to get on amazon and see if others thought it is as bad as i do.	1
	i do not like the characters, the plot, the science, any of it and it goes on and on.	1
	i agree with so many of the posts...the editor should have cut this thing in half and given it the pace of his previous novels.	1
	i am done with dan brown until they are out and proven.	1
	no more buying because i liked the author..      	1
	entertaining story but weak ending.this book had a very good story line and interesting plot twists.	1
	the only problem i had was after the villain was stopped the ending dragged out several chapters longer than it needed to.	1
	it was almost like he didn't quite know how to wind the story down to the end.	1
	other than that it is a good read.	1
	i'd recommend it although don't expect it to be as good as 'angels and demons' and 'the davinci code'.      	1
	let down.i was really disappointed with the book.	1
	brown seems to use the same formula for his last three books.	1
	i could rip the book, but i won't because i think brown is a good writer.	1
	however, i won't recommend this book.       	1
	a total waste of time....an embarassment..best selling authors can sell anything.	1
	the lost symbol proves the point.comic characters without a hint or originality.	1
	a cartoonish villain.	1
	a hero arising from the dead and worst of all a religious, pious diatribe that went on forever.	1
	skip it!	1
	! 	1
	a huge disappointment.i became a dan brown fan after reading 'devincecode'.	1
	also read angels and demons, but this is an absolute disappointment.	1
	ending is awful, predictable and no surprise after all the built up to it.	1
	don't waste your time and money. 	1
	dan brown doing what dan brown does best...not writing....dan brown once again proved why he has legions of adoring fans who eat up everything he writes: he is an absolute master of weaving together intricate puzzles, based on various ancient mythologies and symbolism, that almost always have multiple layers.	1
	unfortunately, it seems he has spent all of his time weaving these puzzles and then not enough time learning how to write.	1
	i know, i know, 'it's just for entertainment.	1
	you shouldn't criticize his writing, since he's not trying to be victor hugo.'	1
	fair enough...i have read all the langdon books and will read the next one, for that exact reason.	1
	it's entertaining, and i like the puzzles.	1
	that doesn't mean i can't criticize his writing style.	1
	i find myself holding my nose while reading his books, then genuinely enjoying the 25% or so in which puzzles are actually being solved.	1
	a few main criticisms: 1.)	1
	entirely too much use of italics.	1
	not only are all the character's thoughts italicized, but virtually every sentence that they speak has a few italics thrown in for emphasis.	1
	people just don't talk like that in everyday speech.2.)	1
	his characters sound like encyclopedias.	1
	way too many passages where i feel like i'm sitting in a lecture hall.3.)	1
	virtually every chapter ends on a cliffhanger.	1
	his writing is bad enough (see point 8) that that's about the only way he can keep people turning the page to see what happens next.	1
	not only do the chapters all end on cliffhangers, but there are numerous places where the characters have already been made privy to some secret information which, for some reason, is withheld from the reader.	1
	that's just annoying.	1
	if you want to put off the secrets for a little longer, don't reveal them to all the main characters.4.)	1
	he plays very loose with facts.	1
	i know it's fiction.	1
	and that's fine.	1
	but there are inexcusable factual errors in here that could be cured with a simple googling.	1
	more than that, they are things that any semi-educated person (as brown presumably is) should know without having to google.	1
	i don't want to spoil it, but i'll just say that there's a certain government agency that dramatically oversteps its legal authorities, and no one even notices.	1
	maybe you can respond that it was just going rogue and knew it was out-of-bounds but didn't care.	1
	well...it doesn't come across that way.	1
	and it doesn't appear that brown has any clue how wrong he got it.	1
	if he did, then his highly-educated protagonist would have at least had an italicized thought along the lines of 'hey, they aren't suppose to be doing that.'	1
	the problem could have been fixed with a simple 'search and replace,' in ms word.	1
	he also takes what are, at best, fringe beliefs and promotes them as fact.	1
	sorry dan, but the word 'amen' is not derived from the name of 'amon ra.'	1
	a cursory internet search will show that this is a myth with no academic backing.	1
	langdon would know that.	1
	if you're going to present fringe beliefs as true, at least have your uber-booksmart protagonist identify them as fringe beliefs.	1
	then, if you want, have them turn out to be true, to your protagonist's utter shock.5.)	1
	noetics.	1
	give me a freaking break.	1
	this is one of the most utterly vacuous ideas around, ranking right up there with astrology and scientology.	1
	okay, this isn't a criticism of his writing, so much as my rant about the fact that the enormous popularity of brown's books is going to spark public interest in this 'science.'	1
	if katherine solomon presented her 'research' to any reputable academic publication or at a major university, she would be laughed back into obscurity where she belongs.	1
	the book tries to defend itself against this criticism by saying that 'round earthers' used to be laughed at.	1
	yeah, maybe.	1
	but you know what the difference was?	1
	they had actual evidence to support the idea that the earth was round.	1
	it's called circumnavigation.	1
	it's the fact that the sail is the last part of a ship to disappear over the horizon.	1
	if the history of science shows one thing, it's that it accepts new ideas when they have evidence.	1
	scientists are perhaps the one group of people on earth who can be generally trusted to discard former prejudices when the facts illustrate that they were wrong.	1
	it is overwhelmingly common in science...politics and religion, not so much.	1
	it happened with evolution.	1
	it happened with relativity and quantum mechanics.	1
	ideas that would have been considered absurd by earlier generations were proven because, once they became testable, the evidence was conclusive.	1
	people have been obsessed with finding hidden powers in the human mind for centuries.	1
	the reason scientists laugh at such absurdities is because, after centuries of trying, no one has produced anything coming close to evidence for esp or telekinesis.	1
	in fact, there have been studies done of 'the power of prayer' which pretty conclusively proved that sick people who receive prayers don't tend to get better quicker than those who don't receive prayers.	1
	the worst thing about this book is that it will result in a surge in popularity in yet another indefensible form of vacuous nonsense.	1
	as if we needed any more than we already have.6.)	1
	the book is essentially a fractal pattern.	1
	the entire story consists of repeated examples of langdon taking the skeptic's view of a situation, only for someone to pull a magic act and show that, 'gasp!	1
	there really is something mystical and literal behind this weird old legend after all!'	1
	then, towards the end, we find that these repeated examples are really just building up to another example that is the sum of all previous examples.7.)	1
	the 'grave threat to national security' is an absolute joke.	1
	at worst, it would destroy the political lives of a few people who probably should never have been voted into office in the first place.8.)	1
	the writing is beyond bad.	1
	it's almost apocalyptically bad.	1
	the screenplay to bill and ted's excellent adventure looks like shakespeare by comparison.	1
	at least that movie was intentionally corny.	1
	brown's language is corny and hilarious, but not intentionally so.	1
	i had to wear earplugs and hold my nose just to make it through the conversations that the characters hold with each other.	1
	even then, my mouth tasted like i had just eaten brussel sprouts.	1
	a bit of advice for brown.	1
	it is perfectly okay to use a an awe-insipring noun, a extremely old verb, or a legendary adjective without famously modifying them by using luxurious adjectives and erudite adverbs.      	1
	unfortunate waste of time.dan brown's previous books were entertaining thrillers.	1
	this one contains the previous books' thriller formula, but the writing is bloated, and in hind sight, you get the feeling you just wasted your time reading it.	1
	hopefully, this review will help you avoid the same mistake.      	1
	tripe....this book is simply...how can i say it nicely...awful!	1
	it is way too long and needs an editor urgently to cut about 150 pages of the pontificating prose out of it.	1
	the ending lands with a resounding, underwhelming and large thud...skip this one.       	1
	dan brown the lost symbol.very interesting book, lots of 'interesting' information about washington, d.c. - makes one want to visit washington, which we may do.        	1
	looks like a brand new book.received this book ahead of schedule.	1
	it was in 'like new' condition.	1
	a best seller at an excellent price.      	1
	predictable and not worth my time.i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	this one was predictable from the start.	1
	when there were intense moments, dan brown killed them by explaining it all away.	1
	i was frustrated reading it, and very disappointed.        	1
	there's nothing like abusing your fans.this is a terrible book.	1
	i learned some things about the masons, but that's not why i bought the book.	1
	i wanted to be entertained.	1
	this book is not entertaining.	1
	it is insulting.	1
	the story is beyond dumb.      	1
	good read.this was not as good as the davinci code.	1
	it was a good read but did drag at times.	1
	it could have been cut down.	1
	the ending was enjoyable.	1
	it just took too long to get there.      	1
	not the best, but decent.this book was probably one of my least favorite dan brown books, but was still fairly good.	1
	the plot was like a roller coaster in the sense that sometimes it was good and fast-paced with tons happening and other times it was slow and boring and seemed to not even going toward a climax.	1
	brown has definitely written better in the past.	1
	definitely worth reading for a minor history of d.c.      	1
	good read.a little slow to start, a bit too scientific for my taste but it gets better and better as it goes on.       	1
	i enjoyed it!	1
	spoilers.i live near dc so it is always fun to pick up a book like this and read about places i have visited or seen, know about, or could visit.	1
	this particular robert langdon novel took me longer to get into than the da vinci code and angels and demons, but once i did, i enjoyed it.	1
	it was fun, and that is about all i can say.	1
	there were some issues for me with clarity, some things never really got cleared up.	1
	for example, inoue sato-director of the office of security for the cia, is she part of the female break off group of the freemasons or not?	1
	it was alluded to numerous times in the book, but we never got a clear answers.	1
	the masons seem to be a go to secret group for books and/or movies like this (national treasure and from hell spring to mind) and i don't mind that, but give me something that the others haven't.	1
	something new.	1
	my one beef is brown's villians.	1
	why are they always....odd..for lack of a better word.	1
	we have had the albino monk, the 'brothers' from angels and demons, and then we have the tattooed 'monster' from this book.	1
	i think it is easy to see the 'monster' in those that do not fit in, that don't blend, unfortunately it is usually the monsters we don't see that are the scariest, and brown doesn't seem to utilize that sort of slippery slope.	1
	this was a fun book, what more do we need!      	1
	could have been tighter.[...].	1
	i enjoyed following robert langdon's character, and the story wasn't bad, but this is one of the few times i wish i'd bought the abridged version.      	1
	good but too unrealistic.too much rambling on while there is an emergency,nobody can loose a hand a be as if nothig had hapened a few days later.....      	1
	the lost symbol.good follow up to his two previous books.	1
	fast paced and intriguing.	1
	good weekend read.        	1
	so loooooooog and boring.i absolutely loved the davinci code, but this was long, drawn out and almost boring.	1
	the characters were not as personable or worth getting into either.	1
	and i was expecting so much more!	1
	judy allen      	1
	not my cup ot tea.i loved all the other books, but this one it took me sooooo long to finish.	1
	i found it boring at times and get lost on all the symbolism.	1
	nothing like da vinci and angels and demons.	1
	good luck on next one.      	1
	lost symbol.	1
	the lost symbol.it was like a scavenger hunt.	1
	i liked the concept of short chapters with unknown or incomplete  suspenseful endings.      	1
	the lost symbol.the book was available at sams the day of release for the same price you charged except there was no shipping charge.it is a fast moving tale with very little reality.	1
	i can't believe someone can cram a tale of 12 hours into 509 pages.      	1
	the lost symbol.this is the most fascinating book i have ever read.	1
	very exciting.	1
	a real page-turner.	1
	nearly impossible to put down      	1
	good story theme, but....it was good, but unlike his other books, it dragged a bit.	1
	there was too much that was restated over and over.	1
	the story line was great, as usual, though.      	1
	same formula....i agree with other reviewers' remarks in that it is just like re-reading his other two books, a&d; and the dv code.	1
	if i had not read those books, i might have a different opinion and would rate 'the lost symbol' higher.	1
	dan brown's formula worked in his previous novels, but as with anything/everything else, it gets old real fast.      	1
	all is not lost with dan brown.dan brown is one of the few authors these days that will make me stop whatever i'm reading at the time just to pick up his new release.	1
	i loved the da vinci code.	1
	i thought angels and demons dragged on a bit too much, but i still liked it.	1
	and the same goes for the lost symbol.	1
	with so many other reviews having already been posted here about the story, i'm going to skip all of that rather than repeat what you probably already know by now.	1
	instead, i want to concentrate on my own personal thoughts on this book.	1
	at first, i was very excited to have brown finally write robert langdon into a story that takes place on our own soil.	1
	our capital was a great setting, but unlike his other books, i didn't find myself running to the computer to google the buildings and artwork so i could see them for myself like i did with the other langdon books.	1
	i don't know if it was because i was already familiar with the buildings and history or just because they really weren't that exciting to me.	1
	the thrill ride that langdon goes on is pretty much the same as brown's other books and so it becomes very predictable.	1
	he moves his characters from place to place where they discover a clue that's strange and peculiar.	1
	langdon decodes it just before the bad guys get there and we move on to the next piece of the puzzle.	1
	and some of those pieces just weren't as interesting either.	1
	the array of characters, including the 'bad guy,' were each strange and peculiar as well, leaving you wondering who is on whose side for a while.	1
	brown is definitely good at characterization.	1
	from an obsessed, castrated villain covered in tattoos to a short and stern japanese cia agent with a deep raspy voice, the characters were both colorful and mysterious.	1
	the confrontation between langdon and 'the bad guy' was also much more intense in this book, and langdon's life was literally on the line this time rather than there just being a gun or fist fight.	1
	i did feel like the book lacked a lot of those little interesting facts and theories that i couldn't wait to discuss with fellow readers like the other two langdon books had, those little nuances that you also couldn't wait to google which really gave the book some depth.	1
	the lost symbol definitely had them, but just not as many.	1
	or they weren't quite as memorable.	1
	in fact, thinking back now, the only one that sticks out at me is the part about where the word 'sincerely' comes from and why we sign it at the end of letters.	1
	in typical brown fashion, there's also this constant struggle between science and religion.	1
	in the lost symbol, we learn about noetic science and the power to control things with our minds.	1
	however, a lot of the writing about it was so bland and technical that i don't even think brown knew what to do with it which was literally why he 'blew it up' to get rid of it.	1
	also, after the villain is caught and all is well, there was still 60 pages left to the book which brown spent talking mostly about god and the bible.	1
	most people i've spoke to just sifted through the ending after the climactic part had come to a close.	1
	overall, i'm not entirely disappointed with the lost symbol.	1
	i did like the code better and will indeed read brown's next book if there is one.	1
	i just hope that brown's writing becomes much more layered and less predictable.	1
	his readers know this equation by now, and while it does sell books, it's time for something new and completely different.      	1
	enjoyable page turner.i read it as quickly as the pages could be turned but was sad that it was so predictable.	1
	i enjoy his books and hope there are more to come.      	1
	meh.	1
	it was ok..worth the $10 for the kindle version.	1
	if you liked his other books, it's not going to disappoint.	1
	lost symbol.the book arrived in great condition and i have just finished reading it....not a good as the davinci code or angels and demons, but still a good read.      	1
	what's the fuss!	1
	!.this is a very disappointing book.	1
	the pace is slow and filled with repeating patterns of dialog and plot.	1
	i generally don't expect much from a dan brown book and he exceeded my expectations.	1
	when you get to the end of this book, you can't help but wonder why so much was made of this so called 'secret'.        	1
	a great follow up to the first two.after reading angels & demons, i was hooked to dan brown...then followed the the da vinci code, and finally the lost symbol...as to where dan brown draws everything out over long processes, his detail to actual fact amazes me.	1
	i think the reason i like to read his books so much is because i learn a lot of the actual history, while reading his suspenseful tale.	1
	was very pleased with this one, just as the others!      	1
	we waited 5 years for this?.we waited 5 years for this?	1
	it's really too bad this book didn't come out before the davinci code or angels and demons.	1
	i truly liked both of those books, actually i have enjoyed all of his books.	1
	this book was just way too formulaic.	1
	it was the angels and demons, but fill in the blanks with the lost symbol information.	1
	if this book had come first, i really think it would have been better received.	1
	it was full of interesting things about washington d.c. and lots of little known facts, but the story was overshadowed by the similarity of his other books.	1
	like michael crichton, you can't fault his research.	1
	well done and quite factual, but come on dan - next time change it up a bit.        	1
	an okay book.one doesn't read dan brown with any expectation of experiencing great literature.	1
	so there it is -- an okay read.	1
	if you belong to a book club you can make a drinking game out of 'suddenly' and 'stared' and 'disbelief.'	1
	if you read it as a whole, and not as a trilogy.diving into 'the lost symbol' was much like jumping into the deep end of a murky swimming pool.	1
	you're expecting it to be cool and refreshing, somewhat familiar, but... once you're down under, you realize that this is your neighbor's pool and though it's still a bit comforting, it's not exactly what you expected.	1
	welcome in the third book in the 'davinci code' trilogy.	1
	robert langdon is a symbologist professor who is known world wide because of his efforts to save the vatican city during the previous two books.	1
	he is smart, funny, and really really cynical.	1
	he usually has ties to very religious people, though is still able to separate himself from their beliefs and his own findings.	1
	langdon has remained true to his beliefs and experiences through 'the davinci code' and 'angels & demons'.	1
	in 'the lost symbol', langdon is duped into traveling last minute to a conference where he will be giving a speech on symbology at the capital of the usa for very important people.	1
	upon his arrival there, he quickly finds out that there is something terribly wrong.	1
	the cia is involved, as well as his dear friend's amputated hand- which lies in the middle of a very important conference room floor.	1
	the chase is on and 'the lost symbol' carries out the course of just over one day's time.	1
	'the lost symbol' carried the same character ideas as 'the davinci code' and 'angels & demons', but it didn't follow the same criteria.	1
	'the lost symbol' actually had less symbology in it than the other two in this trilogy.	1
	'symbol' also had a lot more of a religious lecture to it.	1
	while the other two books felt like they were analysing in order to learn, this one was a bit preachy... especially nearing the end.	1
	'symbol' felt like a thriller, more than detective work.	1
	while 'davinci' and 'angels' kept me glued to my seat so that i could learn what the world meant, i could put 'symbol' down for days and still not feel like i was missing anything important.	1
	as a whole, instead of as the third book in a trilogy, 'symbol' was interesting.	1
	it still dissects current day philosophy and pushes you to re-evaluate your thoughts.	1
	it still has the enchanting characters that you absolutely hate the villan, love the heroine, and of course langdon is always fun to watch (love cynicism).	1
	some of the story was a bit... much, though.	1
	it turned into a bit of a murder mystery by the middle of the book and i was losing count of the bodies- none of the bodies were important characters, though.	1
	as in 'angels', most everyone who died was special in some way.	1
	wait, i said i wasn't going to compare the three books.	1
	but, it's hard not to.	1
	i read the first two and was expecting the same formula and the same abilities.	1
	'symbol' was... entertaining, but... it was a bit of a let down.	1
	instead of non-fiction/ science fiction, i got thriller/ murder mystery- [even a bit of 'fantasy' to me.	1
	he starts talking about souls and spirits, etc] 'the lost symbol' is worth the read... just maybe at a discounted price... in softcover.	1
	i can definitely wait on the $1 rental of this movie, if it ever comes out, rather than going to the theatre.      	1
	much like the da vinci code.i found the story line very similar to the the da vinci code and in that i was disappointed.	1
	the story did hold my interest, although there were times i wish it would move forward.	1
	there were the twists and turns similar to those found in the the da vinci code, but i felt they were not as clever.	1
	maybe this was because i started to reflect on the spiritual part of the story more than the story itself.	1
	i usually reflect on what a story is saying, however, it seem more intense for me this time.	1
	no matter, i am glad i listen to the book and would do so again.	1
	if you want a good story to read or listen to, i would recommend tis book.      	1
	it really depends what you want!.with dan brown's writing there is no finesse, subtleness, or creativity in revealing the plot lines/secrets.	1
	dan brown is like an arnold schwarzenegger terminator rather than a richard attenborough's cry freedom.	1
	yet, like a schwarzenegger movie, brown is a good story teller and it is difficult not to enjoy his novels.	1
	of course his views on christianity and the bible is ludicrous but they are now quite irrelevant.	1
	in fact in this book brown simply blends in with the general view of our culture regarding christianity and the bible.	1
	he is obsessed with the world of suppressed secrets and religious freedom - freedom to have any belief and still be credible.	1
	the lost symbol focuses upon the freemason's and the search for the pyramid which will lead to a masonic `map' which in turn leads to the revelation of the all powerful `word'.	1
	washington dc is the  center of this plot.	1
	a city riddled with secret meanings.	1
	the main `bad' guy is mal'akh, a man who is intent upon discovering this all powerful `word' and thus be given power beyond belief.	1
	he is violent, angry, clever and ruthless in his quest.	1
	robert langdon is drawn into the plot deceptively, as is the cia.	1
	i will not give away any plot spoilers, so you will have to decide whether or not to buy the book or borrow the book, and read it for yourself.	1
	is it a profitable thing to spend a day or so reading this book?	1
	i am not sure.	1
	it depends if you refer an arnold schwarzenegger or a richard attenborough classic.      	1
	i hated it and i loved it.i did not have the opportunity to read 'da vinci code', but had watched the movie.	1
	i found the movie bland and filled with hollywood style fluff.	1
	none of the information and 'secrets'  in the plot was new to me either - that happens when you watch the history channel enough times !	1
	thus i decided to read the lost symbol as i wanted the perspective from a complete and actual book and not a screenplay.	1
	boy was i disappointed.	1
	firstly - it's hard to read a book and already know which actor will play the role - and thus i had to have a few  hours of tom hanks stuck in my head.	1
	i felt that the writer was writing the story with the big screen in mind.	1
	i could picture this little japanese woman played by lucy liu.	1
	i saw peter facinelli (spelling?)	1
	as his good friend peter that was kidnapped.	1
	the requisite, intelligent leading lady role was a mild irritation.	1
	her jumps to sudden insight ahead of the lead, langdon, simply did not make sense where he is supposed to be the super smart historian, symbolist et al.	1
	each chapter gives the reader a moment where suddenly, an awe inspiring discovery or revelation is made - and you have to read through a couple of pages to find out what that is.	1
	and when it is revealed, you are let down as you expected something more earth shattering and mind blowing.	1
	i am not too worried on whether his book is accurate in terms of technology, symbology or history - i am fully aware that it is a work of fiction - however i still felt that some of the things mentioned was unnecessary and i wasn't sure what purpose it served.	1
	i was also boggled that the old story on how man once believed the world to be flat - was mentioned over and over as if the reader needed reminding that we shouldn't discount anything as impossible !	1
	i felt that was an insult to our collective intelligence.	1
	the ending that was supposed to be the major-what-the-world-has-been-waiting-for 'secret' - was again....a major let down.	1
	the fact that the secret verbum significatium was 'the word'  - which was from the bible - as in 'and the word was..god'.	1
	i man really now !!	1
	maybe i'm expecting too much from dan brown's readers, fans and new initiates into his work.	1
	maybe i'm  expecting them to be familiar with the ideas that perhaps god does lie within all of us, or we are gods, or god created us in his image (our minds at least), or that there is only one god, or that we are all one - hasn't various works of fiction, non-fiction and movies taught many that much.	1
	so to have it suddenly be this big secret and then use another old cliche that the bible contains all we need to know - we just have to look for it - or that there are hidden messages in there etc etc.	1
	the only plausible reason for all that i can come up with - is that dan brown is prepping everyone for his next book - something along the lines of the bible being loaned to him by peter to be decoded.	1
	and we will then have a whole new book that steals much of the body of the bible code.	1
	nevertheless - despite all of the above - what i actually liked about the book  - was that dan brown creates a page turner.	1
	he has the ability to tease the enquiring minds that still read books - by ending each chapter with a cliff hanger.	1
	regardless of whether he is a skillful writer or not - the fact that i could not put the book down until i had read it completely - bears testament to the fact that he definitely has a latent talent for turning moderately intelligent people into little kids eager to be let in on the secret.	1
	also i enjoyed the tidbits of masonry.	1
	everything i've ever read or watched paints masonry in a dark light - this was the first time i have seen it portrayed in a benevolent way - makes me think dan brown is a closet mason - or rosicrucian at least (not - i have no desire to google whether he is or isn't , just my opinion).	1
	i also enjoyed the busting of a few myths i didn't know.	1
	as learned and cultured  as i'm sure many readers are - i for one am slightly learned but definitely not cultured, and did not know a few things he mentions in his book such as the work with noetic sciences, the intention experiment, the whole mayan 2012 world ending doodads, the existence of the paintings and sculptures he describes.	1
	so - as with any book - i am reviewing it based on whether it was worth my time reading it, and if i gained anything by reading it - whether it's good entertainment value or whether i took anything new away from reading it.	1
	it was a moderate in entertainment value - however i am a very curious person so i love myth busting, revelations and learning new information - and that's where i rate it highly.      	1
	dan brown recycling old material.dan brown is a great writer so it disappointed me to see him use the exact format from the da vinci code for this book.	1
	it was interesting to see him place it in our nations capitol and use the free masons as his secret society, however everything else was a copy of his block buster.	1
	if you are looking for something new don't waste your money on this book.	1
	read one of his other books such as angels and demons or digital fortress.	1
	otherwise get it from your local library.      	1
	just another book.i will keep it short.	1
	the story is interesting for most of the book, say about 70% of it.	1
	i am not talking about how factually correct things are, just that the flow of the events in the book makes it a good read.	1
	as we get closer to the end this book falls apart a little bit.	1
	some things appear to be forced to a conclusion vs. offering truly an interesting ending.	1
	lastly, it also felt like dan brown was trying to be nice to the believers and practitioners of christianity in this book.	1
	the end had way too much debate about the bible, which really felt out of place.      	1
	formula or mirror by any other name.the lost symbol is all right, but i don't think dan brown is such a great author.	1
	his plots move, but this book is a mirror plot of da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	even the characters are mirrored.	1
	a beautiful brilliant female scientist, a tattoed demon instead of an albino, running around a city, dc instead of rome, and the mirrors go on.	1
	repetitive phrase to the point of irritating, and flat characters with dull dialogue.	1
	the ending is weak and that is kind.	1
	the ending is boring and nearly stupid.      	1
	to much filler not enough killer.i read both angels & demons and the davinci codes.	1
	of the 2 of those i like angels and demons best.	1
	adding lost symbol to the mix, it is my least fave of the dan brown 'trinity' of books.	1
	i agree with a lot of the other comments made here-it took way to long to get to the real storyline, it was half way through the book before we got there.	1
	then once the major story is wrapped up we had another 70 pages or so of fluff that i was asking myself 'who cares'?	1
	this book was too much filler not enough killer.	1
	the actual story hidden inside all of this exposition and uselessness was a pretty good one.	1
	the story was of course the same old dan brown formula.	1
	langdon and a hot female scientist have to save everyone.	1
	i don't fault him for sticking with the formula that works, but he needs to work it over a bit more.	1
	it is like he is filling in the blanks on a template with this one.	1
	someone else compared him to jk rowling and the harry potter books because they follow a specific formula but do a better job, and i agree.	1
	at least in harry potter we are carrying forward an entire story arc, we add new characters that reoccur in subsequent novels.	1
	we are in fact building upon our knowledge of the wizarding world.	1
	perhaps if brown is going to stick w/his cash cow langdon he could take a page from this style as well.	1
	it might make his books more interesting if i thought there was more to the story to come later.	1
	anyways, i bought it for $17 and am glad i didn't pay more than that.	1
	the other 2 books i couldn't put down.	1
	this one i almost had to force myself to finish.      	1
	batman redux.as i read this novel i kept being reminded of that campy batman series on tv decades ago.	1
	the riddler or the joker would make some incomprehensible rhyme, and batman would say, 'robin, that means this villain is planning to steal the crown jewels of elbonia on display tonight at the gotham museum.'	1
	and off the caped cruscaders would race in their batmobile to thwart the crime.	1
	pow, bam.	1
	batman, i would add, was always on the money with this interpretation of the 'clues.'	1
	and so is our hero in 'the lost symbol.'	1
	all he is missing is the cowl and cape and utility belt.	1
	part of my problem with the book is my distrust of rites and rituals, because they render unnecessary rational thought.	1
	and part of my problem is my inability to accept metaphysical and paranormal explanations for events we have not yet the wit to understand.	1
	when i see the magician david copperfield walk through the great wall of china, i do not believe he has sold his soul to the devil--or that there is a devil--for supernatural powers.	1
	the magician just knows how to made it look as if he has such powers.	1
	i simply cannot accept the mumbo jumbo of noetics, masonic stage plays, incantations, magic numbers, or biblical prophesy.	1
	all that aside, the writing in 'the lost symbol' is just a wee bit--well--bad.	1
	a mansion 'nestled' on a hundred acres was funny and broke whatever spell mr. brown was trying to cast.	1
	in fact, there were chiches throughout.	1
	then there is the abundance of sentences and words in bold type, to make absolutely sure the reader 'gets' it--wink, wink, nod, nod, pay attention to this.	1
	james patterson also does that, and i find in annoying and even insulting.	1
	a writer needs to write in such a style that the reader cannot help but pay attention and 'get' the point.	1
	one last point about the writing:  at odd times throughout the writer stops the action cold to give the reader a professorial lecture that includes all the research the writer did.	1
	after all, he didn't want it to go to waste.	1
	i could cite many examples, but it just doesn't seem worth it.	1
	the entire plot is ludicrous.	1
	take a super-villain, tatooed, hairless, castrated, muscled, learned in the arcane arts, and have him commit pitiless acts and perform superhuman feats, one after another.	1
	pit him against a professor who knows damn near everything there is to know, throw in chase after chase, plus a waifish cia director, and you have a best seller, but you don't really have anything that lingers long in the brain.      	1
	good plot but weak ending.i was looking forward to this book after reading all of dan brown's other books, devils and angels, four in the morning three days.	1
	so whats bothering me?	1
	the ending!	1
	yes the book was action packed...yes it was very informative.yes i still consider mr brown a genius at uncovering little known truths about past secret societies.	1
	he writes very well and connects all elements of the story well.	1
	the 'villian' in 'the lost symbol' was very well descripted, but a bit repetitive about his final goal.	1
	probably mr brown should have put the last few chapters before the thrilling, dramatic end..it reminded me of ann rice writing very good vampire thrillers and then making a left turn into the devil and god rationale according to ann rice.	1
	the treasure being sought did not turn out to be as materially real as in his previous novels, but rather more esoteric.	1
	it was good, entertaining, but i expected a more 'real', tangible treasure!!	1
	!      	1
	a satisfying addition to the robert langon series.in 'the lost symbol' dan brown sticks to what has worked for him in the past.	1
	the book includes the requisite secret society, evil villain, and other assorted characters and leaves you guessing as to what that exact role of each is until the very end.	1
	the action is very fast paced and jumps quickly from scene to scene as in brown's previous entries.	1
	i enjoyed the book even though there were parts that certainly left me shaking my head.	1
	the whole noetic science thing was a bit out there for my liking but the book remained a page turner nonetheless.	1
	the bottom line is that if you enjoyed 'angels & demons' and 'the da vinci code' that you will likely enjoy this book as well.      	1
	not so impressed.the book seems to be all over the spectrum.	1
	it jumps around and i have yet to make a connection with any character.	1
	i found myself staring off into space on more than one occasion while trying to wade through this book.	1
	not his best writing for sure.	1
	on the other hand, i have surely read worse.      	1
	read demon/chronicle instead.while having fully enjoyed mr. brown's two previous robert langdon novels i have to admit to being very disappointed by the lost symbol.	1
	the puzzle solving and game playing of the earlier books was almost nonexistent in this one.	1
	i almost couldn't wait for it to end so that i good get to work reading something else that would be more enjoyable.      	1
	what a long and hallow let down!.not as interesting nor as finely honed as his prior works.	1
	but worst of all  --- the 'big twist' was far too obvious.i am placing dan brown among the list of authors leveraging their past excellence with a less than average follow up work.dan brown meet patricia cornwell.	1
	a waste of time and money      	1
	it was okay.it was a decent page turner.	1
	very predictable, with a very lame ending.	1
	the book lost me when langdon was put in the isolation chamber.        	1
	entertaining.i didn't read this book with the expectation that it's the most brilliantly written story ever written!	1
	i didn't expect the most brilliant writing.	1
	what i did expect was that i'd be entertained, and i was.	1
	plain and simple.	1
	it was a thriller and a page turner.	1
	it will not make a lasting impression on me and that's fine.        	1
	makes you think about....what i expected and why i like dan brown novels.	1
	i did not find this to be the furious page turner of the angels and demons nor as controversial as the davinci code.	1
	so i wondered what i was expecting.	1
	after thinking about it, i realized that the dvc and angels and demons were poking at perceived bullies and flawed institutions.	1
	the idea of hidden wisdom and knowledge being suppressed was in and of itself exciting and provocative.	1
	in the lost symbol, dan brown has changed the playing field.	1
	the evil is more remote and detached from our everyday experience and the tone is more pro-institutional (the institution being the masons).	1
	all the normal hooks are there that send you to wikipedia to see if that is really true.	1
	however, his message was somewhat obscured.	1
	but still insightful and interesting.	1
	the last 25 pages of the book were to me this most insightful.	1
	i sense mr. brown believes we are in monumental, troubled times.	1
	his message is one that we need wisdom, not just knowledge.	1
	knowledge, depending upon the mindset behind its use, can either create or destroy.	1
	i sense this is his plea to take the time to assess where we are (knowledge hidden from many who accept 'conventional wisdoms and media sources) learn from history and change our course.	1
	many who are looking for the riveting thriller may be disappointed.	1
	as for me, i think i'll go out and look at the stars tonight and ponder how i can be a part of change.      	1
	disappointing.i read the lost symbol while sick at home over the weekend.	1
	had nothing else to do, so i had plenty of time to ponder the symbology, look up words i didn't understand, google a few things -- basically, to have fun with the text.	1
	what a snooze, and no, it wasn't from the cold medication.	1
	i was absolutely bored by the book.	1
	and the ending?	1
	what ending?	1
	compared to his earlier works, the ending as about as anticlimactic as it gets.	1
	i'm not expecting the ending the be a nice, neat little package perfectly tied up with a bow, but this was crap.	1
	i know we are supposed to suspend our beliefs and, at times, reality when reading brown's work.	1
	that isn't a problem when the story is interesting.	1
	two stars.	1
	one for the beautiful cover, and one because i finished it.      	1
	start with the ending first next time mr. brown.two thirds of the way into the lost symbol- i was enjoying it... but then, it started to lose its way.	1
	it was almost as if dan brown got to that point in the story and was like 'oh crap - now how can i end this???'	1
	.. to me, it was like he had all these great ideas leading up to a couple of mysterious revelations (what was on the laptop, what was the treasure) and bammo - didn't know what they were himself so came up with sub-par drivel instead--- lame ass shizz.	1
	i'm thoroughly and utterly let down.	1
	i was enjoying it... and then, the sizzle died suddenly and - sigh, what absolute drivel.	1
	he almost had it though.	1
	he needed another year or 2 on this.... take his time and come up with a better laptop revelation, a better mysteries revelation.... cut out the waterboarding, sigh, ... oh dan, man, you let us down.....      	1
	great research, little art in  the writing.i really enjoyed dvc, and a&d.	1
	;  just a few pages into tls it felt like the 2 page chapters were an attempt to meet a publishers deadline and fill space.	1
	i love the research and background that are brown's signature.	1
	however, the storytelling itself lacks art and elegance.	1
	it feels like he shoves the history/background/research/architecture into a common formula.	1
	the masonic descriptions seemed to be respectful.	1
	i have to confess i was expecting more joseph smith/mormonism references for a 'american' centric exploration of early u.s. history, architecture and mythology.	1
	i was expecting better story and evolving/improving style.         	1
	unworthy.as has already been said, this is a disappointing rewrite of the da vinci code meets national treasure.      	1
	oh dear.here we go again, but with fewer adjectives.	1
	the da vinci code seemed to substitute adjectives for description, a weakness which seems to be more restrained this time.this reminded me of junk food.	1
	much more quantity than quality, hard to stop gorging on it, but ultimately not satisfying.it is likely that this will be more of a hit inside america than in the rest of the world.	1
	this contains great dollops of the civic religion which the rest of the world looks at wryly.	1
	america the hope of the world, america the great exception.	1
	washington is an imperial city, modelled on rome and sometimes as brutal in its imperialism.	1
	if you live outside the boundaries of the inner empire, somewhere outside the united states, the shining symbols seem rather more tarnished.      	1
	dan brown's jumped the shark.i've read all brown's novels, and this one was a real disappointment.	1
	each of the three major twists are anemic, the science is bastardized, and the ending is so anti-climactic, i thought maybe all of the pages hadn't downloaded to my kindle reader.	1
	finally, the prose and styling are so automated that i'm not sure brown was present for a lot of it.	1
	don't waste your time.i really like dan brown's other two books, but this one was such a let down.	1
	don't waste your money...it's just not worth it.	1
	i felt like i was being preached to, throughout the book... it was a slap in the face, over and over again...i felt like he thought the reader wasn't very bright, so he kept saying the same things over and over again.	1
	i cannot recommend this book.       	1
	predictable and disappointing....and kind of annoying.	1
	much has been written about this already, so i'll just say this: - the major plot twist was totally obvious very early in the book.	1
	- the 'cliff hanger' chapter endings (all 100+!)	1
	were completely contrived and manipulative.	1
	- yes, we know langdon is a claustrophobic skeptic -- you don't have to tell us over and over and over.	1
	too bad, because i liked the other two books.      	1
	average at best!.it's amazing that it took so long after da vinci code and angels and demons for this book to come out.	1
	it felt as if it were a cheap, wal-mart knock-off to those exceptional books.	1
	i kept wanting the book to get going and soon found that i was on page 508 and it never did.	1
	terrible waste of time.      	1
	provacative, i vote it best integration of academic materials.i have read all of dan brown's books and have found each one to be educational as well as a good, solid read, the kind you lose sleep over.	1
	i agrees that he is not the best writer but i find him no more formulaic then steven king or michael crichton.	1
	i think his books do lack a good editor; one that will insist on paring out the irritating summery review that is generally reserved for serialized writing where there may be a delay in reading the next section, so the reader requires a reminder.	1
	that being said, the book was engrossing and the riddle tantalizing.	1
	i really love the mixture of real places, organizations, rituals and scholarly writings.	1
	as in all his books, my curiosity is peeked, sending me to google to do additional research.	1
	i am always amazed at what i learn.	1
	i recommend this book for everyone to read, though there is some startling brutality for the tender of heart.	1
	no worse than everyday tv though so do not let that hinder you.	1
	this book is entertaining and makes you think, as it have at least 3 layers of understanding.	1
	if you have 'ears to hear' you will read it in one setting.	1
	i listened to the unabridged cd audio version first, missing out on the helpful diagrams and pictures found in the book.	1
	the audio version was fairly well done and at one point i was sitting in my car for 20 minutes, unable to disembark until the current predicament was resolved.	1
	buy them both and enjoy!      	1
	save yourself some time and money.i was waiting anxiously to get my hand on this book on the night of 15th , i pre-ordered it on kindle and sure enough it arrive promptly at 00:01 am , i was very pleased with amazon kindle delivery but that was only thing good about this book.	1
	this is nothing but a re-hash of 'angels & demons' and 'da vinci code'  plus whole bunch of nonsense, third time around roberts comes across as a pretentious teacher and symbols and clues feel like made up , book labor through 500+ pages just to end with a complete dud .	1
	i would like to write more but i don't want to spoil it for anyone though i wish someone spoiled it for me before i wasted my 10 dollars and time on this.       	1
	more of the same from brown....if you liked the davinci code, you should like this book-- especially if you want to read the exact same book over and over again.	1
	let's go over dan's writing checklist: 1) mysterious summons from old friend/mentor... check.2) lead female character linked/related to (1) above... check.3) 'inside' look at the secret ceremonies of a semi-mysterious organization... check.4) shady character linked to (3)... check.5) reference to the sacred feminine... check.	1
	yep, it's a dan brown book!	1
	how could it possibly have taken him 6 years to write this?	1
	i am really thankful that that my kindle let me read the first bit for free and saved me $10.      	1
	subject matter interesting, plot amateur and predictable.i liked the davinci code, even with it's unrealistic plot line the subject matter was eye opening and interesting.this book however, the plot is just ridiculous.	1
	the characters seem like the same characters from da vinci, especially the bad guy.	1
	i thought 2 of the major 'twists' in the book were completely predictable.	1
	(location of the mysteries and who the bad guy was).	1
	subject matter was interesting - d.c. sites, history and masons.	1
	i thought maybe the ending would justify how painful it was to read most of this book but i was very very disappointed with the end.      	1
	dissapointed.dan brown's 'the lost symbol' was a highly disappointing book.	1
	the writing was not that great and it was highly repetitive.	1
	the cia director of security came across as a total buffoon.	1
	it did not present anything new or revealing about the secretive masons.	1
	it was a big letdown from 'the davinci code.'	1
	wait till you can find it in a used paperback bookstore and buy it for around $3.00.      	1
	underwhelming.first half thriller, last half scrmabled.	1
	i was hoping this would be a great ride, but was sadly dissappointed.	1
	tedious, too long, boring, of little consequence.       	1
	another dan brown roller coaster.this thriller is just as exciting and even more believable than some of his earlier ones.	1
	i thought i knew washington, d.c., pretty well, but he opened my eyes to some new facts.	1
	should be of interest to men, women, young and old.	1
	but be prepared for an all-nighter.	1
	once you start, you can't stop.	1
	loved it!      	1
	lost symbol.this book is a page turner and i have already passed it on to a friend.	1
	can't wait to see tom hanks again on the big screen....it's gonna happen, right?      	1
	a real page turner if you're a fan.the lost symbol is the now-familiar allegory of the intellectual elite carrying the heavy burdens of the obdurate masses in the face of government persecution.	1
	in this incarnation, a harvard professor totes a granite block all around washington, dc, on behalf of some masons, while the government (cia in this case) chases him around with helicopters and night vision goggles.	1
	it's a timely and damning profile of the us economy in 2009, but it gets even better:  the heavy block has a soft bottom and a missing peak, a clever metaphor for middle america.	1
	the missing peak of the block--actually a pyramid--is a solid gold cap (think: financial services/goldman sachs) is not physically connected to the rest of the block.	1
	there's an audible 'click' when it is occasionally attached to the base, the unmistakable sound of a bailout payment.	1
	the book is a real page-turner.	1
	i bought a hefty table fan and set it next to the book on my desk.	1
	at 'low', it flipped the pages for me at a reasonable clip.	1
	whenever the pace of the tale slowed down (e.g., during long passages in italics), i would simply switch to 'med' or 'high' to keep things moving.	1
	the book itself is hefty, with an msrp to match.	1
	you can pick up a copy at the sale rack at your local grocery store (as i did), but i have a better suggestion for the true aficionado:  jump the next flight on jetblue for dc to tour the various lost symbols cited in the book.	1
	board the plane early and grab a left-behind copy of the lost symbol from a seatback pocket in one of the exit-row seats.	1
	(remember to leave your copy for the next bloke when you disembark at dulles.)	1
	the ticket will cost you less than the actual retail price of the book, and you'll be going 'green' by recycling.	1
	if you're in need of some lighter fare like patterson or danielle steele on your return flight, go southwest.	1
	oh, and don't forget the fan.	1
	this book is chock full of text in 'italics' (i didn't know how to put italics in italics, so i used quotes).	1
	after extensive research of ancient texts at the library of congress, i learned that 'italics' are a kind of metadata for symbols.	1
	in other words, it's symbolization for symbols.	1
	armed with this insight, i counted all the italicized words in the book (i just put my fan on 'high' to do this).	1
	the ratio of the number of all plain words in the book to the number of italicized words is 33.  no surprise there (read the book and you'll catch my drift).	1
	then i ran the italicized text through a decryption algorithm, using '33' as the key for a substitution code.	1
	after removing all duplicate letters, the italicized text reduces to this message: 'themeaningoflifeis42'.	1
	i wavered between rating this book a 3 or a '5'.	1
	it's an entertaining and interesting book, with marvelous plot details and twists.	1
	i asked myself: is this an enduring classic that will engage the next generation of jetblue passengers in 2010?	1
	i think so.  	1
	fun book.i truly enjoyed reading this book.	1
	i read for pleasure, not to over criticize sentences or paragraphs.	1
	i read with the hope that the book will flow smoothly and keep my attention.	1
	this book did that exceptionally well.	1
	i have enjoyed all of dan brown's books and hope he keeps them coming.      	1
	dont care for disabled people.no thanks dan brown i guess you dont care about the disabled people that use the kindle audio enabled to enjoy the written word when they can't see the text.	1
	guess what its not all about you.	1
	forget your book forget you it must be all about the money for you..we'll read someone else thats not so greedy would you mind telling us why you wont allow speech to text on my kindle.people need to boycott you jerks.and you reason was ????????????	1
	?      	1
	very good.this is in response to 'pen name'.	1
	get your authors straight.	1
	it's douglas preston and lincoln child, not lee child, who has his very own thing going with jack reacher.      	1
	it's a followup.been reading some reviews and it seems like the hunt for dan brown is on?	1
	this isn't a perfect book in any way but it is a worthy followup to the da vinci code.he uses the same style, the same type of action etc etc.	1
	so bascially, if you liked the da vinci code you will like this, not much have changed.	1
	the big letdown for me in the book was the explanation of the cia's interest in it all.he simply couldn't conjure something worthwhile there, but it's just a sidestory so i shrugged it off.	1
	the most interesting part of the book is actually the last chapter where he sums everything up.the action is already done and handled, so this is mostly a recap chapter.in it he shares views that will create heavy collisions with people who considers the bible to be untouchable.i'm wondering if this is part of why some people are so upset, his views are a rather heavy kidneyblow to lots of christians?	1
	i've read parts of those ideas in other places as well, it strikes me that he has been inspired by someone for those ideas though?i wonder who?      	1
	entertaining and fun to read.dan brown follows up the da vinci code with this thriller, set in washington dc.	1
	as we have come to expect from a dan brown novel, the characters are modestly developed, the story line takes many twists and turns, there are more than a couple historical and scientific 'facts' revealed to the reader, and there are good guys, bad guys and a few we can't be sure of until the end.	1
	i won't go into any plot descriptions, as it may ruin it for a reader, but will say that the 'deep secret' premise in the lost symbol, as well as the plot line, actions and activities are much more plausible than angels & demons or the da vinci code.	1
	if you are looking for the second coming of tolstoy or hemmingway - dan brown doesn't deliver.	1
	this is a good, entertaining book.	1
	this isn't a literary classic.	1
	enjoy it for what it is - and you will not be disappointed.      	1
	facts not in evidence.i am about half-way through the unabridged audio version.	1
	the story is ok, but mr. brown needs to research some of his more mundane facts as well as he does his arcane facts.	1
	bunsen burner fuel is not a liquid.	1
	the cia has no arrest authority, and there has never been a cracker jack decoder ring, in fact there have only been about 3 decoder rings ever.	1
	there are lots of decoders, but being children's toys, they use simple substitution codes and the size of the dials makes a ring quite large.	1
	there was a chex one, a cap't crunch one i think, and an ovaltine one (it's huge).      	1
	rip-roaring story amid the lecture.there are some really exciting and creative twists, turns, and puzzles in this novel, which is the basis for my 4-star rating.	1
	the codes and puzzles are fascinating and fun, chases and escapes put you on the page-turning edge of your seat, and there is one enormous twist that i really never saw coming.	1
	i had a very hard time putting this novel down.	1
	brown is a master of the cliff-hanger.	1
	however,,,there were quite a few times when i read and read and read, and was still on the same page.	1
	brown does love to lecture, and some of the book is dense and repetitive.	1
	(well, his characters lecture.	1
	one even cheerfully launches into a twenty-page-long history, science and philosophy lecture -- with accompanying guided tour -- despite the fact that he is badly injured and desperately needs medical care.)	1
	here is an author telling his readers, 'i spent 50,000 research hours in libraries and archives worldwide and, by golly, you're gonna know it!'	1
	burying actual plot and puzzles into these lectures makes it difficult to just skim them.	1
	so an unfortunate chunk of this novel can be a pretty wearying slog.	1
	also, characterization is not brown's strong point.	1
	characters are mostly ciphers running around creating havoc or following clues in a national treasure-type hunt.	1
	but that hunt is fast and furious, leaves characters and readers alike gasping, and is, despite all the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, very, very entertaining.	1
	after all, we're not really reading brown for sensitive character development.	1
	we're reading him for fun, puzzles and enigmas, a little esoteric history (although he provides a lot), and a runaway train scavenger hunt.	1
	all this brown certainly delivers.	1
	there's not much payoff to all this racing around, but it's fun along the way.	1
	in fact, brown packs in so much plot and energy that i was surprised at the end to realize the whole story took place over only about 12 hours.	1
	and the ending, while a letdown, was not unexpected.	1
	after all, robert langdon must say about twenty times, 'there can't be any such thing!'	1
	still, i wasn't disappointed.	1
	the lost symbol is imaginative and energetic, and there are lots of twists and surprises along the way.	1
	i really did enjoy it.       	1
	eh, it seems all to familar.i've read both angels & demons as well as the da vinci code, and if you've read one, you've read them all.	1
	now i found them all entertaining, but it just doesn't seem very original.	1
	i don't think dan brown's a bad writer, it's just that it's really difficult to write a new book that isn't a squeal without changing your original formula.	1
	i also feel like people's hatred of it for religious reasons is just idiotic.	1
	i mean come on the catholic church acted like the da vinci code was going to destroy them, and that it was far more powerful than them.	1
	all in all i liked the book, but it just wasn't very original.      	1
	awesome book.great book, as i saw someone mentioned earlier it makes me want to go back to dc and while reading , had google right there with me looking up information, looking at pictures that the book referred too.	1
	it was ans awesome reading.	1
	took me a little longer than two days because i had to work and stuff but i would recommend it to any one , even if your not much of a reader, get to this one before the movie comes out .	1
	it would be worth the read!      	1
	great read.after reading a few of the reviews that were hilighted on the page for this book i decided to write a review of my own.	1
	i am a dan brown fan and have read all of his books.	1
	the divinci code was first, then angels and demons.	1
	next was decpetion point and digital fortress.	1
	i felt the first two were great reads, i couldn't put them down.	1
	the second two (deception point and digital fortress) were more difficult to pick up and read although i did finish them both.	1
	so when 'the lost symbol' was coming out i was not sure which category it would fall into.	1
	having received a kindle dx from my beloved husband for my birthday (thank you sweetie) i was happy that i could download a 'sample' of the lost symbol before buying it.	1
	i was hooked after the 4th chapter.	1
	i feel that dan browns characters were portrayed well and his writing was amazing.	1
	it kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire book.	1
	the twists and turns that the book takes kept me guessing throughout the entire book.	1
	i was battling a pretty vicious cold during most of the reading of the book and didn't want to rest, i wanted to read the book.	1
	i'm sad that the story is over and wish there were more to read.	1
	i do not feel that the writing was sophomoric at all, i feel mr. brown put enough detail into the text to ensure that the reader was fully aware of what was happening and could imagine it in their mind.	1
	would i like to see this made into a movie?	1
	most definitely!	1
	for those who like a page turner with lots of twists and turns, this is a wonderful example.	1
	i rank it up there with divinci code and angels and demons.      	1
	the best piece yet..dan brown's writing is inspirational.	1
	in lost symbol, he inspires the reader to look back in time and study/review the ancient mysteries of our world.	1
	to the author, thank you!	1
	please continue to write your word.      	1
	critics who assert that this is not great literature are missing the point.yes, dan brown's grammar, syntax, and structure may leave his more literate readers dissatisfied, but this just tells me they were mistaken to be looking for great literature here.	1
	proves once again that dan brown is a member in good standing of our pantheon of great story tellers; another genre entirely.	1
	i approached  as a good read.	1
	i wanted a great story, an adventure.	1
	anything i might learn (or mislearn) along the way about freemasonry, pyramids, symbols, our founding fathers, or the architecture of washington, dc: well, all the better.	1
	and i was not the least bit disappointed.	1
	so suspend your reality for a couple of evenings, and dive right in.	1
	i guarantee you'll enjoy the twists and turns and improbable characters and their behaviors, and that you'll finish it feeling satisfied and happy about the world.	1
	and that is a perfectly good reason to read a book.      	1
	realistic fiction, but fiction nonetheless!.great writing!	1
	i loved it.	1
	i didn't think he could top the da vinci code, but he has.	1
	unfortunately, it seems that many people are missing the point.	1
	this is fiction layered onto fact!	1
	and what a wonderful job dan brown has done.	1
	the architecture of washington, d. c., the art work, the basic premises of the masons .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	have all been so well researched that everything he has created here is plausible--even though it's fiction.	1
	readers need to remember this.	1
	as he did with the da vinci code, he tells us at the beginning what is fact, expecting us to know that out of fact he has created fiction.	1
	from the first page to the last i loved it.	1
	even after the climax and resolution of what might be perceived as the main plot, i was still in thrall, right down to the last word.	1
	i am already anticipating his next novel.  	1
	great story.while it isn't the davinci code this was a great, gripping book!	1
	i could not put it down and i was up until 1am trying to finish this!	1
	my favorite thing about dan brown is his ability to make you want more.	1
	you just cannot stop reading.	1
	i love the suspensful way he will end a chapter and then move on to something else the next chapter...i almost want to skip ahead to find out what happened but also don't want to miss one, single thing.	1
	yes, this book is predictible at parts but so what?	1
	it is a great read.	1
	the biggest thing to remember with brown is it is fiction.	1
	he does not claim that his books are true.	1
	it is a wonderful tale that, yes, will make you think and turn to google to look some stuff up :)it was a good follow up to the davinci code.	1
	now i am waiting anxiously for the next robert langdon book!      	1
	relax!!!!!	1
	!.please people!!!!!	1
	just relax, take a seat, and enjoy the read.	1
	don't take it too seriously!	1
	i loved it.	1
	finished it in 4 days.	1
	dan brown.... forget these naysayers!!!	1
	i thought it was awesome.	1
	all i was expecting was an exciting, action-packed book and you delivered. 	1
	interesting and informative.i read this quickly, it was interesting and fast moving.	1
	i love brown because his work is informative.	1
	i learned so many interesting facts and a lot about washington dc.	1
	this is good recreational reading.	1
	i don't read brown looking for great writing and superior literature.	1
	something about the 'moral' of the story stayed with me and made me think.	1
	to me thats what a good book does.      	1
	flawed?	1
	yes.	1
	great read?	1
	you betcha!	1
	!.dan brown has many detractors.	1
	these people abhor what 'literature' has become and make fun of the writing, story, and characters.	1
	but you know what?	1
	two of his novels have been made into huge blockbuster movies, and i predict this one will as well.	1
	this story follows the continuing adventures of robert langdon, harvard symbologist.	1
	this time his adventure takes him to our nations capital to track down the hidden masonic treasure.	1
	where this may sound a bit like national treasure, the similarities end there.	1
	where the aforementioned tracks down gold and valuables, this treasure is knowledge, and the knowledge is power to change the world.	1
	definitely a page turner, brown starts almost instantly with the adventure continuing until the conclusion almost non stop.	1
	i found myself reading late into the night, unable to put the book down until i found out what happened.	1
	they book mixes esoteric with adventure and continues throughout.	1
	i will say, however, that brown's writing does suffer from some drawbacks.	1
	his use of dialog to explain things ad nauseum and his overuse of some phrases.	1
	if i had a dollar for every time someone 'stopped short' in this book, i could retire today.	1
	that having been said, the story does what it is supposed to do.	1
	it entertained me, had me turning pages, and satisfied my hunger for a good story.	1
	after all, isn't that why we read books?      	1
	just fine..typical dan brown fare.	1
	if you liked his other stuff, you've already established yourself as a not-too-discriminating reader at least part of the time (no fault there), and you'll definitely love this because it delivers on more of the same code-cracking, ancient ritualizing, and religious/political pseudo-commentary.	1
	books like this have their place - for me, that's the subway (on the iphone kindle app - because i wouldn't be caught dead showing an 'infinite jest'-reading ridership the dust jacket of this book) - a place where concentration and deep thought are tricky and reading three pages at a time is just fine (i used to try to read adorno and walter benjamin on the subway, but stopped because the paragraphs were just too lengthy for me to get through without distraction).	1
	but of course, there are thousands of books that fall between dan brown and david foster wallace on the spectrum of readability and worthwhile-ness (which goes from readable to ulysses on one axis, and time-wasting to worthwile on the other), so your money would be better spent on something in the readable/worthwhile quadrant, rather than the readable/time-wasting quadrant that the lost symbol occupies.	1
	more fun than the lost symbol: a book of cryptograms and word puzzles and brain teasers for $1.49 in the supermarket checkout line (or your grandmother's house).	1
	less fun than the lost symbol: stephanie meyer's 'twilight' books.	1
	in closing: holy italics, batman!	1
	i know it's not a work of art.no it's not a work of art or the best book i've ever read, but i really enjoyed it.	1
	i have read all of dan brown's books and will most likely read any new books he puts out.	1
	if they make a movie, i'll go see it.      	1
	enjoyed the hoodwink.i suspended my disbelief, got caught up in the ridiculous journey, and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.	1
	my only caveat is that brown's treatment of christianity, which i do know something about, is so superficial and addlepated that i have to wonder if his treatment is similar when it comes to the masons, noetic science, and other obscure topics.	1
	i'm guessing yeah -- but then if i want to know more about those things, i am not going to read a work of escapist fiction written by a master magician of the art of spinning a tale using so many of the elements i've loved since childhood -- hidden codes and symbols, treasure maps, good versus evil, danger looming and escaped, twists, turns, and surprises, and a testing of the hero's mettle where he or she triumphs in the end.	1
	get your hoodwink on and take the ride.      	1
	great fun!.while i would admit that dan brown is not the most gifted author when it comes to his choice of words, i will definitely say that his stories are always interesting.	1
	i was a big fan of the first two novels in the langdon series, and i was not disappointed when i read this one.	1
	it is a worthy successor to the first two.	1
	i think that the strength in brown's novels, whether 'factual' or not, is that he offers good alternative, fun, 'food for thought' versions of the stories that our society holds dear, while wrapping a good thriller around them.      	1
	................i'll make this quick as it seems most people have similar reviews.	1
	first, the story and theme was much too similar as the previous books.	1
	i couldn't help but wonder in the beginning chapters, if indeed the book plot's and ending would be similar.	1
	unfortunately, i was right... although the research was fascinating and kept me entertained, the book was just too alike the da vinci code.	1
	it killed most of the suspense and thrill.	1
	in fact, some parts where otherwise would be interesting became rather dull.	1
	the professor and a female companion running away from the police while in the midst of trying to solve a puzzle?	1
	hmmm.... is there going to be a big twist in the end like the others?	1
	oh no... anyhoo, good/average book but nothing great...i would recommend going to barnes and noble on a saturday/sunday morning, order a nice cup of coffee and brownie and finish it right there.   	1
	what you would expect.personally i liked this book, it is the kind of stuff i like to read.	1
	it definitely wasn't the same kind of masterpiece that i thought angels and demons or the da vinci code was.	1
	it was somewhat predictable and followed closely to the dan brown formula.	1
	when his first books came around, it was something fresh.	1
	after reading those two, there wasn't anything unique about the lost symbol.	1
	it was angles and demons basically taking place in dc.	1
	it seemed dan brown wanted to put as much of his research into the book as possible.	1
	sometimes it didn't seem integral to the plot, more like it was just shoved in there so that the research wasn't done for nothing.	1
	at the same time, i still loved it and couldn't put it down.       	1
	mysticism and symbolism aside, feasiblity limited.	1
	i enjoyed this book for the most part, but there were actions throughout this book that made me stop and think, couldn't this have been written a bit more credible?	1
	here im not even addressing the mysticism or symbolic reference, i'm addressing the basic plot.	1
	overall, i enjoyed this book, the pace was fast and the story line interesting.	1
	however, that said, i felt frustrated by several situations where the feasibility of what the author wanted me to buy into.	1
	from the begining i questioned brown, allowing our 'brilliant professor langdon' to be so gullible in the first place and this seemed to a common thread throughout the storyline.	1
	protecting our 'national security' with a staff conisisted of what, a handfull of cia operatives?	1
	buzzing to and fro to cover all the bases throughout the plot?	1
	i know there have been federal cutbacks, but not very realistic.	1
	come on.	1
	and ms. solomons labratory being 'in the dark' so to speak?	1
	here again, i believe the author should have been more 'illuminated' in the difference between feasibility and creative license.	1
	in spite of all the symbolic elements common throughout brown's book, i really felt 'dumned down' by the author.	1
	that said, it was entertaining overall, although as others stated the ending left me unsatiated after such a gruelling quest.    	1
	i want my 6 years and 500 pages back.it took 6 years to write this?	1
	angels and demons was a great read, the da vinci code was a page turner but the formula was starting to show it's weaknesses, but this thing just completely falls apart every other chapter.	1
	nothing left to say that hasn't been said by the other reviews and it's 2.5 star rating.      	1
	lot of rambling.i have now read all of dan brown's books.	1
	lost symbol is creative and a page turner, as are his other books.	1
	i found the end to drag on forever in this case, though.	1
	if you like his other books, i believe you will enjoy this.      	1
	roller coaster ride.the setuppeter solomon, the director of the smithsonian institution, is abducted by a strange person named abadon, partly for the purpose of forcing symbologist robert langdon to help him (abadon) discover the ultimate secret of freemasonry, which abadon believes is all he needs to be transformed into a genuine immortal demon.	1
	abadon has a vendetta with the solomon family, having murdered peter's mother some years earlier.	1
	peter's sister catherine (a noetics researcher) joins langdon in the search for peter, which requires unraveling the masonic symbolic mysteries of washington d.c.  that's the setup.	1
	additional details would be spoilers.	1
	commentwhat many, perhaps most, readers fail to realize is that the robert langdon novels all have exactly the same theme.	1
	the theme is an 'alternate' (alternate to the government-approved version of spirituality taught by the priests to the masses) spiritual tradition which predates christianity, and which is continued in little-known christian sects (as well as within obscure jewish and islamic sects).	1
	virtually every detail in brown's novels is  accurate (to the extent such details have been previously published), including the history of the sects, the descriptions of the doctrines, the symbols, and descriptions of ancient traditions.	1
	these traditions represents the theology of the 'enlightened' from pythagoras to dante to divinci to thomas jefferson.	1
	while the corresponding doctrines of some sects in the tradition are open to debate, the tradition is never-the-less historical reality.	1
	'the lost symbol' concentrates on freemasonry, which while not exactly a religious sect, nevertheless identifies with this tradition.	1
	for example some groups within the large umbrella of freemasons call themselves knights templar---which historically was a (renegade?)	1
	monastic order of the roman catholic church.	1
	since publication, masons have refuted some details, but brown was accurate to the extent that details had previously been published at the time he wrote the novel.	1
	mythology and allegory are major components of masonry.	1
	my understanding is that few (if any) masons themselves know exactly where masonic mythology ends and real history begins, so we should cut brown a little slack on that score.	1
	in a way, a theme of 'the lost symbol' is heresy and heretics.	1
	(by the way, the literal, not figurative, meaning of 'heretic' is 'one who thinks for himself').	1
	in 'the divinci code' and 'angels & demons,' brown presented ideas considered heretical by the catholic church.	1
	therefore brown was reviled by catholics and became the darling of progressive liberals, who just accepted the spirituality as necessary fiction (as a vehicle) for the anti-catholic tirade.	1
	however, in 'the lost symbol' (and actually in the earlier langdon novels as well) brown has presented ideas heretical to progressive liberalism (e.g., that evil may actually exist, the assertion that spirituality has value, and the historical fact that 'rational spirituality' been a major force in the world since antiquity, and remains so).	1
	it is brown's blasphemous challenge of established ideology which has earned 'the lost symbol' so many negative reviews.	1
	hell hath no fury like a progressive liberal rebuffed.	1
	it is remarkable that revolutionaries almost always end up perpetuating and even exacerbating the evils they rebelled against.	1
	modern progressive liberals are far more rigidly doctrinaire and grimly intolerant of dissent than the 'system' which they justifiably rebeled against.	1
	i'm no fan of the catholic church, nor even fundamentalist christianity, but i find progressive liberalism at least equally oppressive.	1
	critiquealthough containing numerous minor implausibilities, inconsistences, and at least a few downright errors, 'the lost symbol' is engaging and entertaining.	1
	such a book requires a straight-man, as played by robert langdon.	1
	langdon is sometimes oddly skeptical of trivial, widely believed (even if unproven) historical assertions.	1
	at other times he is much too quick to accept fantastic claims, based on little or no evidence.	1
	at times langdon makes brilliant deductions, at other times he is thwarted by the most minor logical challenge.	1
	it might be better to have a 'scully' and 'molder' pair to play these rolls.	1
	character development is formulaic, but this is an action novel--far too many authors have listened to critics and ruined perfectly good action novels with wasted pages and chapters of 'development' of uninteresting characters.	1
	pacing is erratic, but so is that in a roller-coaster ride.	1
	indeed 'the lost symbol' is about the closest literary equivalent of a roller-coaster ride that i can imagine.	1
	i found the plot predictable, and solved several of the key mysteries (abadon's identity and the 'winding staircase') at an early point.	1
	but that did not distract from enjoyment of the story.	1
	unlike many reviewers, i think that it is good storytelling technique to give the reader the satisfaction of being 'smarter' than the protagonist, at least on some story elements.	1
	as in other brown novels, brown spends far too much time unnecessarily pushing the high questionable ultimate implications of his theses.	1
	for example, why not (in 'the divinci code') leave some mystery regarding the nature of the grail?	1
	brown's interpretation is only one of many.	1
	similarly, although not a son-of-the-widow, i'm sure that different masons get different things out of masonry, and have different beliefs about what the ultimate mysteries may be.	1
	why not leave some mystery?	1
	as purely fictional modern action-mystery, 'the lost symbol' rates perhaps 3 1/2 stars.	1
	but as historical fiction, brown earns another more star for his extraordinary research, and excellent presentation of the historical facts.	1
	the verdictthe lost symbol is a fantastic ride of non-stop suspense, filled with fascinating mysteries.	1
	so much so, that when i finished, i turned back to page one, and started the novel again. 	1
	irishrover317.for the plot... it was fast-paced and preposterous... what's not to like?	1
	sadly, the last few chapters wander into the abstract metaphysical constructs of the ages, with no more definitive answers than have been attempted since the dawn of time.	1
	enjoy the ride, but get off before the last stop. 	1
	outstanding book, his best so far.i have read every one of dan brown's books.	1
	this one is his best by far.	1
	this book was fast paced, very well researched, and kept you on your toes throughout the book.	1
	i hope his next one is even better than this.      	1
	i hated the da vinci code - i liked the lost symbol - go figure?.i liked this much better than the da vinci code.	1
	though the plot is contrived and ridiculous, it kept me turning the pages, and along the way i learned stuff about noetics, the masons, washington, d.c., and the history of knowledge.	1
	it ended with good messages.	1
	i am kind of embarrassed to admit it, but i thought it was pretty good (if one can suspend disbelief about the actual plot).      	1
	a thriller to a dead end.when i was questioned as to whether i planned on reading this book, my typical response fell somewhere in-between the lines of the `maybe later' reply.	1
	the stories from the two previous books featuring robert langdon proved themselves entertaining, but there was nothing compelling about either one to convince me into dropping my current reading list to join `lost symbol' mania.	1
	then a coworker set the book on my desk in an almost challenging gesture, forcing me to respond... not to my surprise, what i discovered was another page-turner.	1
	just as with 'the davinci code' and 'angels & demons', brown leads a reader with promises of historical teaching moments, pseudo-conspiracy theories, villainous brilliance, and the possibility of simple truth revealed for the first time.	1
	there is a wonder at how much of what he alleges is actual reality versus embellished beliefs.	1
	that curiosity creates a sort of american mythology that could possibly be true, or could be the impossible-to-prove stuff of legend.	1
	the constant `is it real; or is it mere fiction' quandary draws the reader forward to the story's culmination.then there is the question of the masons.	1
	are the masons as intricately connected to american success as proposed?	1
	from this one reader's perspective, whenever the masons are discussed, that discussion is always followed with a litany of famous historical characters claimed as masons.	1
	when those same historical characters are written of, any involvement in masonry is never mentioned.	1
	it seems brown masters the ability of offering just enough truth in his fiction to make whatever is not actuality, a possible fact; hence part of the reason this book is so easy to turn from one page to the next.	1
	you not only desire to see how robert langdon solves the riddling mystery posed to him by the villain, but you also find yourself wanting to know just how much of what robert langdon states is real.	1
	the bottom line, in my opinion, is anyone who enjoyed the previous stories from dan brown, they will enjoy this one as well.	1
	it is worth the read; it holds a person's interest quite easily.	1
	however, and i include this as a caveat, the ending fails to coalesce with the plot.	1
	not only does the villain (a superb blend of brilliance and insanity) alter his focus from ascending into heaven to become like god (what the `lost symbol' is meant to reveal), but the summation given by two of brown's characters in the final few chapters makes no sense.	1
	brown is obviously trying to infuse his story with a bit of heart, to lift it above the status of mere thriller, i.e.	1
	some `meaning' readers can take away after the last page is read, but he misses that mark.	1
	`the lost symbol' is an excellent thriller.	1
	period.'	1
	lost symbol.another interesting book by dan brown.	1
	enjoyabe fiction with facts interspersed to make anexcellent read.	1
	fun to read.      	1
	enjoyed this book completely.i loved the mysteries and pace of this book.	1
	i gave it to my 14 year old son to read and he couldn't put it down.	1
	it is what a fiction book should be, captivating and enjoyable.      	1
	oh dan, dan.although mr. brown can create momentum and suspense, the lost symbol bored me to death.	1
	the last act was an insult to my intelligence.      	1
	great book to read.some time ago i made myself read davinci code.	1
	the book was great.but when my friend gave me the lost symbol i was thrilled.	1
	this book really keeps you going from first to last page.	1
	it was surprise for me that dan brown used the same person from davinci code and demons & engels.	1
	but the story is very good.	1
	i you like secrets and murder this book is must to read.	1
	i would be glad to read it one more time in some months.       	1
	another great novel.another great novel.	1
	by mixing fact and fiction  he creates a stage for another amazing novel.      	1
	an awesome extension to his previous works....if you've read angels and demons and the da vinci code, then this is a must read.	1
	i give it 5 stars.	1
	he mixes fact and fiction into a heady mix that makes you almost believe it happened.	1
	its a pity i bought my copy at costco for [...] bucks when i could have got it on amazon for $[...].      	1
	ignore the dan brown critics.this is the third dan brown book i have read (angels and demons and the davinci code) and i still can't figure out his legion of critics.	1
	the lost symbol is an interesting, entertaining, fascinating, educational and suspenseful novel.	1
	it moves quickly and keeps the reader involved to the end.	1
	yes, the formula is similar to his other books, but it did not dilute my pleasure from reading the lost symbol, a real page-turner.	1
	don't be put off by the critics.	1
	the lost symbol is worth reading.      	1
	a great read, better than davinci code.this was a fast paced, exciting read.	1
	another great book by dan brown.	1
	he knows how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.      	1
	worst ending ever!!	1
	!.good book until the last 50 pages!	1
	seriously, the worst ending to a book in the history of books, which in turn made the whole book a waste of my time.	1
	i would definitely not pay the money to buy this book.	1
	get it from your local library because in a couple months it will definitely be in stock because it is such a bad book!      	1
	dan brown symbols.dan brown is a favorite author..he does his research and makes you believe fiction is fact...always expect a twist at the very end..      	1
	am.	1
	another masterpiecefor those die hard dan brown fans out there this follow up does not dissapoint.	1
	another action packed symbol adventure just waiting to be turned into a film.      	1
	not worth the wait.very disappointing follow up to dvc.	1
	as many reviewers have commented this is almost a cut and paste.	1
	indeed there were times when i wondered if dan brown had even written it himself or just rented his name to it.it gets one star for sending me to google to look up melancolia i by durer and getting me to think a little more about the architecture of our capital.otherwise the principal characters are extremely irritating (for two supposedly super intellects they remain obdurately ignorant throughout), the neotics sub plot is irrelevant, the villain is unbelievable, and the end is so vague i still wonder if i perhaps missed some great revelation.	1
	at least now i know what my friends' fathers were up to all those years ago when they took off to the lodge.	1
	i thought they just wanted to get some peace away from their families.	1
	little did i know they were plotting world domination.sadly this is sure to be a major blockbuster and will doubtless be released as a poor tom hanks film within a year.      	1
	amazing.another dan brown classic.	1
	would recommend to any fans of 'the davinci code' or 'angels and demons'.      	1
	venting for both my son and myself.i bought this book because my son made me do it the day it came out, the i had to put it in my suitcase and haul it to china where he is going to boarding school.	1
	no i did not read it on plane because i like to travel extremely light.	1
	no i did not read it before i took off but i saw some bad reviews and warned my son.	1
	once he got it he put his head in it like he did with angels and demons.	1
	however he seemed unhappy about midway.	1
	when he finally finished he rolled his eyes.	1
	i took the book from him and became the next victim of wasting 2 nice mornings of my time and screaming in the end 'what?'	1
	we fought over ad.	1
	it had the adrenaline rush.	1
	what is this book?	1
	'secret' everyone is trying to protect is no secret at all.	1
	the all-powerful villain is just an idiot(yeah, drawing a circle with dot on your head will make you king of darkness) out for personal revenge.	1
	and not only do the female 'scientists' have no chemistry with robert in every novel (i don't mean anything derogatory, i am a female scientist), now she is getting older too.	1
	50 something.	1
	have they already someone in their mind to do the movie?	1
	hopefully the money i wasted can teach my son (who aspires to be a writer)a good lesson about how not to write.        	1
	riveting read.	1
	finished the book in 4 days after work.	1
	enough said!      	1
	a thesis on the 33rd.mr.	1
	brown has created a real page turner.	1
	although the lost symbol stretches plausibility in some cases, the basic story line is very good.	1
	it really commands the reader's attention.	1
	although i'm not a 33rd degree mason, he seems to make fun of the masonic rituals for the 33rd degree.	1
	the casual reader would enjoy this book and also be motivated to visit the buildings in washington dc both masonic related and others.      	1
	"read the review by 	valannin 'pantheon outcast'.i had planned to write a negative review of this book, but thanks to reviewer, 'valannin 'pantheon outcast', i don't need to bother."	1
	he (or she) wrote a fabulous hilarious review, way more entertaining than the book itself and a much more detailed review than i could ever write.	1
	i gave the book two stars because it is interesting in parts and does hold your attention while requiring a major suspension of belief and reason and intelligence.	1
	if you do plan on buying this book, then i urge you to not read that review, else you will be laughing at all the wrong places while slogging through this work.      	1
	bow wow!.i am a fan, but this book is a dog!	1
	don't bother folks, get his first two books: 'digital fortress' and 'deception point.'	1
	everything else--yes, including 'the da vinci code'-- from those has been a decrescendo of inspiration.	1
	for truly great, entertaining reading, try anything by arturo perez-reverte, and donate this brown puppy to your nearest salvation army store so they can make the $.50 cents on re-sale.      	1
	misses the mark.i found this book to be very disappointing.	1
	it felt like the author did not put the effort into the research and characterizations that he had previously.	1
	shame on you mr. brown, don't let success go to your head.      	1
	okay.i love dan brown's books and this one is okay.	1
	not his best book.	1
	when the book is about the story it is exciting but when the book stops to tell you about history is becomes like reading a text book.	1
	same plot lines as his other books.      	1
	formula written.i didn't realize how shallow the concept or how overexposed i was to  mysticism in a novel till i read this utterly far fetched and frankly dull book.	1
	wooden characters who never develop populate this formula piece.	1
	the action is is as ridiculous as in angels and demons.	1
	too many gimmicks, too little substance.	1
	save your money and time.      	1
	lost symbol.	1
	fantastic voyage of imagery!!	1
	!.thanks dan brown, you did it again.	1
	you captured my imagination and made me sit up late nights reading to finish your over 500 page book.	1
	this was a easy read and quite intriguing the links made between religion or more specifically the bible and the masonic order.	1
	great book!!	1
	!      	1
	favorite dan brown thus far.i am not sure why so many people that dislike dan brown's earlier books would read this one.	1
	i for one absolutely love dan brown's books -- all of them.	1
	this latest novel is his best yet.	1
	from the first page, i was hooked and had difficulty putting it down.	1
	i appreciate that he can pause to educate the reader while never slowing the action or intensity of the plot.	1
	he doesn't waste time on irrelevant details and is a master at creating interest and tension to keep the reader engaged.	1
	if you don't like dan brown, my guess is you won't like this book.	1
	but if you enjoy his books as much as i have, you will not be disappointed.       	1
	good...not great, but still a good read..i enjoyed the book.	1
	i did not find myself loving it the way i did da vinci code.	1
	first off there is not as much romantic interplay between science and the arts as in the other book......and for the average person 'noetics' is kind of beyond our kin.	1
	it almost seemed like mr. brown was trying to make amends towards christianity and the bible.	1
	perhaps trying to convince us that he believes in god?	1
	i honestly don't know how much of what he presents about freemasonry is correct but it did make for a good story.	1
	also we did not find out anything new about the main character which is frustrating.       	1
	lost and found - the great novel!.so, here's an observation regarding amazon reviews, based on my personal experience.	1
	if you don't apply a 5 star review to a book you get a spate of critical reactions from fans who enjoyed it.	1
	ok - i get it.	1
	but yet, how can you alert prospective readers, especially those who rely on the integrity of my reviews, that 'this is really a 5 star review?'	1
	i find this to be a significant point, especially for an author like dan brown who is clearly in one league, while virtually everyone else is in a lesser one.	1
	in 'the lost symbol,' it's about the depth and the detail, the flow of the story, and the pure desire to read every word on every page, then wish there was even more.	1
	it's about the author challenging you to keep up with the symbols and the story.	1
	'the lost symbol' has all the bases covered :  a great story, intrigue, the plot twist, good guys and bad guys, and a great ending.	1
	the book creates excitement as you turn the pages, providing the same kind of reaction you may have felt when watching 'raiders of the lost ark' for the first time in the theater 25 years ago.	1
	however, in addition to all of that, 'the lost symbol' is smart, educational, informational and provocative.	1
	it inspires the reader to put the book down only long enough to run to their computer to google the references for added context.	1
	in the end you simply ask yourself how any author can be so creative and so well researched as dan brown.	1
	there are over 1600 reviews already filed on 'the lost symbol' so i will not try to recount the details of the book.	1
	read them yourself for the  pleasure of knowing that when you see other novels with 5 star reviews, they are doubtless receiving grade inflation, a chronic trend that allows the mediocre to masquerade as the meaningful.	1
	frankly, there should be a special rating for books of this caliber to denote their brilliance.	1
	i'd give this one a 10 on a 5 star scale!      	1
	another fascinating trip with robert langdon.this is another race the clock thriller like both da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	the story keeps jumping around and just when you think that you (and langdon)have your mind wrapped around something, that fact changes and you are off again on another chase still trying to make it in time.	1
	i would not consider this story to be as good as da vinci code, it is still an enjoyable read in its own right.	1
	one of the best aspects of this book for an american reader like myself is that it takes place in washington dc and shows off the history and culture of the area.	1
	while it was very interesting to read the historical items about paris, london, rome, and vatican city, it means a lot more when it is somewhere in your own country along with the fact that i have visited some of the places mentioned in story.	1
	i would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good thrill-a-minute ride along with one where the facts change almost as fast as you turn the page.	1
	just be ready to spend some time with it since you will find yourself wanting to read just a couple more pages to see what happens next.      	1
	this is not good.	1
	read all the other dan brown books.	1
	they are good!.i really liked all dan brown books, but this one is not good.	1
	it is boring, it is predictable, it is badly edited.	1
	the other dan brown books are like 100 times better.      	1
	dan brown improves on da vinci.i was wary of picking up this book.	1
	i loved the da vinci code and i've found that with sequels, while entertaining, don't usually provide the 'oomph' of the first book (and i say 'first' loosely because i know angels and demons preceded da vinci but i had read da vinci first and then gone back and read angels and demons).	1
	that being the case, i was pleasantly surprised when i couldn't put lost symbol down!	1
	to me the story had much more action, more character development, and more drama than da vinci.	1
	it also seemed to provide a lot more food for thought than da vinci code did.	1
	i was swept up in the thrilling story line and finished the book within 2 days of picking it up!	1
	if you haven't picked up this book yet, please do.	1
	you won't regret it!	1
	dan brown just gets better and better!      	1

	you also learn so much about history and new technology with dan brown's books they're not candy reads........      	1
	great read!!	1
	!.i thought the book was great.	1
	slightly different from his other two robert langdon books, which i also love.       	1
	great.dan brown can always impress me with his excellent writing skill.this book is better than angels and demons      	1
	jim's disapointment.	1
	this book does not come up to the entertainment of dan brown's other books.	1
	i was disappointed and would not recommend it.	1
	save your money.	1
	jim      	1
	brown has done it again.couldn't put it down!	1
	i stayed up all night to finish it and although the ending was a bit of a disappointment, the book, on the whole, was thrilling.for anyone who enjoys a good read; this book is for you.      	1
	oe of the worst books i have read!	1
	!.at the beginning it was ok, first my wife read some but soon put it down, too bloodthirsty!i hung on but skipped 1/4 of the book.too much repetition,again, too much repetition!!!	1
	i don't even want to see a movie of it!!	1
	what a shame, dan is a loser this time.can i get a refund !!	1
	!michael o'mara      	1
	maybe next time.what started out as a great book turned into watching  a balloon slowly deflate.	1
	the history and symbolism were fascinating, but the whole tattooed menace grew old quickly.	1
	i can't say that the book was overly long, or dwelled on the wrong thing, it just lost it spark midway through and never regained it.	1
	invited by his long time friend peter solomon, robert langdon has been invited to washington dc to delivery a speech.	1
	not only is solomon an important man in his own right, as head of the smithsonian museum, but he  also happens to be a high-ranking mason.	1
	there was no speech planned, langdon was lured there because it is thought that he could unlock an ancient portal hidden in washington.	1
	peter solomon has been kidnapped and with the help of solomon's daughter, langdon sets out to decipher clues that will keep solomon alive and slowly discover the guarded secrets of the freemasons.	1
	through use of symbolism and neotic science brown leads the reader down many twisted avenues to an ending that was neither shocking or awe inspiring.	1
	though there were many good sections and times that i went and did a bit more research on topics that were mentioned, overall the book was just so-so.	1
	langdon seemed a bit more bumbling then i remember him being in previous books, the beautiful woman that assists him is over used and the tattooed antagonist was predictable.	1
	maybe it was because of all the hype, but i was expecting more.	1
	maybe next time.  	1
	lost in the lost symbol.it is quite unusual for a followup to a blockbuster to be as good or better than the previous effort but i agree with many that dan brown has done it.	1
	the best part of this type of book is waiting with bated breath to see how a man survives drowning or how a character escapes from an unescapable predicament.	1
	sometimes you see some things coming and sometines you don't but the fun of the book is that the situations are astonishingly interesting and the resolutions equally satisfying.	1
	now if mr. brown can explain how a human being exposed to the kinds of stresses and injuries he inflicts on them can a) remain out of the hospital, b) remain awake and c) retain their sanity, i'd appreciate it, but in the tradition of 'willingly suspending disbelief' in the arts i'll cut him a break yet again in the lost symbol.      	1
	not what i expected in an arrogantly hubristic manner.first of all, i don't think 'the lost symbol' can be considered as good as the da vinci code, but it's pretty close on the von richter scale.	1
	i mistakenly bought this book because a friend told me it was about robert langdon meeting ringo starr and asking him how his drum kit and symbols interfaced with the science of matter and anti-matter.	1
	imagine my utter dissapointment when i discovered that a symbol is not the same as a cymbal used by a percussionist!	1
	that said, i humbly decided to read the rest of the book and i was more than pleasantly surprised in a disturbing manner.	1
	i really enjoyed the excellent writing style, similar to ernest hemingway on a bad acid trip.	1
	i highly recommend 'the lost symbol' to people with short attention spans, especially the part about the indisputable science of noetics and the symbol being lost and then found at a later time.    	1
	a thrilling brain buster from the start.	1
	unreview of 'the lost symbol'.i would have loved to have written a true review after reading brown's latest novel.	1
	unfortunately, it was purchased as a gift for my son-in-law who loves his books as much as i.  economy being what it is, i have to wait until he finishes reading it.	1
	however, i called him to ensure it arrived [which it always does when ordering from amazon.com] and he still had the box on his lap as well as he'd already started reading it and found it intriguing right from the beginning..../d	1
	'my god'...dan hits another grand slam!.ok, so we have too many italics all over the place.	1
	in fact, way too many!	1
	and we have some overheated family discusssions, and even a little purple prose.	1
	plus, the book might be a bit long..but for a zany tour thru some obvious and probably underappreciated dc highlights, dan once again leads the pack.	1
	the twist at the end, another brown trump-card, did not strike me as a surprise either.	1
	but if there is a better page-turner, more informative about 'secret history' (exempting dan's other books!	1
	), let me know, and i'll check them out.	1
	and the very last lines are keepers, not to mention the last word.	1
	mr. brown leads the pack, and for good reasons: amazing research, a real 'you are there' style; taut descriptions;action written as well as anyone else out there..the list goes on....so, i'll accept all the 'my god' italics, and look forward to this great author's next one.         	1
	lost symbol a unique read.dan brown once again titillates his reader's intellect while distracting him/her with a thrilling sequence of fictional events.	1
	brown seems to have further developed his world-renowned faculty for juxtaposing the quagmires of history with the cliffhangers and enigmas of the modern world.	1
	the secret code is a 'must read' for the new-age, avant-garde bookworm.	1
	brown is by no means a paragon of the literary realm, but with an intriguing tone and crptic style he excels upon the reader's cognizance.	1
	brown's the lost symbol is a successful attempt to awaken the masses from the deep slumber of social and cultural relativism.	1
	freemasonry in america, ancient mysticism, and noetic sciences are all unique in themselves, but woven together make for a much more interesting tale.        	1
	not sure how i feel........i guess after reading da vinci code, love that book.	1
	this book read like a movie script, i saw tom hanks running from scene to scene.	1
	it wasn't as compelling as da vinci.	1
	but i also enjoyed some of the facts, i didn't know.        	1
	a continuation of dan brown's work.if you're looking for dan brown, you'll find him in his latest book, the lost symbol.	1
	i enjoy reading books for the worlds they create, stepping into early 1900's cornwall, i'll opt for a morton or austen book; looking for legal intrigue i'll pick up grisham; in the mood for a magical adventure, j.k. rowling or johnathon stroud.	1
	finally, for symbolism and intrigue, dan brown's my guy.	1
	the lost symbol pulled me in and kept me focused from start to finish.	1
	i'm always looking for an interesting journey in reading and never a swash buckling end.	1
	i purchase a book to fulfill me at every turn of the page.	1
	each time i picked up the lost symbol i was transported and entertained - difficult to do when you only have a few minutes here or there to read.	1
	some say the latter half of the book is a bit dry - i have to disagree, albeit the latter half is more enjoyable when you have a quiet space to mull over the discussions of science and religion.       	1
	entertaining again.dan brown's lost symbol is another novel in the tradition of his famous thrillers.	1
	the lost symbol definately takes you for a thrilling ride through washington d.c. and is another fast paced journey.	1
	is it a cookie cut book from the da vinci code just using a different subject?	1
	maybe so but that doesn't mean it fails to entertain.	1
	i will say that the end of the book dragged.	1
	the book comes to a climactic ending only to then drag on and push a philosophy to its readers.	1
	this will definately not spark as much uproar as his other novels but may create some controversy.	1
	it really is a thrilling read and is a page turner from the beginning      	1
	he has done it again..like many of us, i waited a long time for this new work by mr. brown.	1
	i have often had expectations that the author could not live up to, when i waited so long.	1
	that was not the case with this newest book.	1
	it was every bit as engaging as any of the others and in my view, only angels and demons was as good and perhaps better.	1
	i could not put it down.	1
	i will be ready for his next effort, whenever it comes.        	1
	very bad ending.the book started well then you can notice that it follows a repeated pattern that make it boring, and the end was the worst, everything was predictable and not the greatest ending in mysteries.      	1
	easy as watching a film.i like the lost symbol because it is easy to read, instead of watching a film i read this book an it's quiet as easy as watching.	1
	i red also the pervious langdon books dan brown wrote and so i felt directly familiar with.	1
	i could not understand way so many reviews her criticize the authors writing abilities because everybody who buy or bought the lost symbol could easily know which sort of book it is.	1
	some people seem to be annoyed about the fact that this book describes sciences which are in reality not really scientific but this was also predictable in order to this author.	1
	for an immigrant like i am it's a convenient way to read in english no dictionary is necessary like buy my other english reading projects (marcel proust: the search for the lost time and the gilgamesh epic).	1
	the inductive approach robert langdon uses to solve the ancient puzzles is really congenial.	1
	the lost symbol posses all what i expect from  a mystery/sifi thriller (suspense, action, drama, murder and ancient riddles).      	1
	very well written book!.i've read all of dan brown's books.	1
	i enjoyed angels and demons more than the da vinci code but i think my new favorite is most definitely lost symbol.	1
	he's facts mixed with fiction makes you believe his story-line.	1
	he has a way of putting loose facts together and making cohesive sense out of them.	1
	i think he's a great writer!	1
	he's style is modern and very well organized.	1
	the book has a good flow and there are points where you feel what the characters are going through.	1
	this book is worth the money...time!	1
	you'll enjoy it!      	1
	'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead' or 'when i see a critic, i call pest control'...  take your pick..admiral david farragaut, when invading mobile bay during the civil war said, 'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead'  in his most recent book, 'south of broad, pat conroy has one of the characters say, 'when i see a critic, i call pest control...' both comments would be appropriate for the reviews this book has received.	1
	take your pick of the above quotes, but, and this is most important, read the book.	1
	it's good.	1
	as farragaut might say, 'damn good.'	1
	many if not most reviews of 'the lost symbol' have been less than sterling.	1
	the new york times review was especially, small, back-biting and vitrolic.	1
	it read almost as if the critic--and who ever built a monumnet to a critic--was jealous of dan brown, the acclaim he has received and the money he has made.	1
	to say that he has sold-out to the masons and is only interested in money says more about the critic that the book.	1
	this is a good book, a page turner, lots of history and interesting fact woven together with an action packed fast moving story.	1
	it won't receive the reaction the da vinci code received, but this is a good book, a worhty followup to the code.	1
	yet, and this was interesting, the book's biggest surprise--the villan's identity and the reason for his villanry--was almost readily evident about halfway through.	1
	if not readily evident, then relatively easy to figure out.	1
	that's unusual for a dan brown book, but it matters not.	1
	how brown gets to the end, the symbols he reveals and the story he tells is enrapturing, moving and unforgettable.	1
	the reader will never look at washington d.c. the same way again.	1
	don't miss this book--don't let the critics dissuade you--don't miss anything with dan brown's name on it as author.	1
	we are fortunate to live and read in the time of dan brown, vince flynn,nelson demille and brewster milton robertson.      	1
	good solid read.i guess i liked this book more than most of the readers.	1
	i'm not always looking for high falootin' literature, just some entertaining hours of escape.	1
	i heard a couple at the train depot saying that this book seemed to them like dan brown was already writing the screen play.	1
	for me, that was a plus.	1
	i listened to this book on audio and it really translated to the 'theater of the mind'.	1
	98% of the book was a page turner (cd turner?).	1
	i'll admit the ending was weak - possibly non-existant.	1
	all in all i give lost symbol a thumbs up....bg      	1
	another fantastic novel from dan brown.i am shocked by the low reviews of the lost symbol.	1
	i've read all of dan brown's books and the lost symbol ranks right next to the davinci code and angels & demons.	1
	everything presented in this book is highly plausible, if not true.	1
	i love the quick, easy-to-read chapters - nearly all of which end in cliffhangers!	1
	the twist at the end was completely unexpected and i really enjoyed the turn it took.	1
	i believe a lot of people who have strong religious convictions will have trouble reading this book with an open mind.	1
	perhaps the most startling assertion is that man is created in god's image, not physically but in the mind.	1
	the secret of the masons lies in the bible, koran, torah, etc.	1
	and that they tell two stories: one that most common men can understand, and another one that only truly enlightened men can understand.	1
	for example, it tells of the story of manna falling from heaven.	1
	the common man would take this to mean that some type of bread or nourishing food fell from the skies, however the enlightened man understands that manna is in fact a waxlike substance secreted by the brain when in a meditative trance that nourishes the body and that the brain/mind is actually where heaven is.	1
	if you like fast-paced and mysterious books about secret societies and solving codes, i highly recommend the lost symbol.      	1
	brown, erasmus and nietzsche.what erasmus did with irony in `the praise of folly', dan brown does with suspense in `the lost symbol': identify religion where it `established itself as a tollbooth to heaven'.	1
	`god is dead'.	1
	[i.e.	1
	the lord...] `however, mankind will for centuries continue to demonstrate his shadows in caverns; we will yet have to besiege those too.	1
	[nietzsche]      	1
	thrilling page turner!.dan brown does not disappoint in this new action thriller.	1
	i loved the mysticism, the science, the history and of course, the plot and characters... i loved everything about the book (that is except the need to stay up way too late reading rather than sleeping of course).	1
	after reading several other authors who i felt needed an editor to shorten their books by about 200 pages, it was truly a pleasure reading a book whose words and pages consistently urged me forward wanting more.	1
	now that i finished the book, the biggest problem is waiting for the next one.       	1
	very disappointing.i've come to expect a lot from dan brown, and this one definitely did not deliver.	1
	when i reached the end, i felt as though i'd gone there for no particular reason.	1
	it was pointless and disappointing.	1
	robert langdon deserved a better story.  	1
	i have read this before, right?.look, it was fun to read - took all of a couple hours, but i have read this story before.	1
	formulaic, and thus even more predictable than his other stories and in the end, boring.   	1
	a bit elitist for my taste.....this is several hours of my life i will never get back....all this blahblah about secret wisdom that only the 'enlightened' can know ,while the rest of us rubes, us unwashed masses remain ignorant i guess.	1
	:)      	1
	thrilling self-development textbook.i quite agree with negative comments here, like it's long for the plot, too much explanation on what we already know, too many references of the same tips, etc.	1
	but still, it's a page turner and a fun read, was a nice resort during my busy working days to escape from reality.	1
	also, the scientific facts about human mind are interesting.	1
	i enjoyed reading it along with touring the national mall in d.c. on the google map.one thing i would like to suggest to mr. brown and his editors is that they were too careless about the name of the female cia director, inoue sato.	1
	although sato can be either a first name or family name, inoue is definitely a family name.	1
	so, calling a fierce cia woman director 'director sato' which sounds kind of cute for the japanese was a big error.after we all know what was going on in the tatooed guy's mind, this book transforms itself to be a self-development and enlightenment book.	1
	i didn't want to sleep up to the final scene with the guy and peter, but after that i kept falling asleep while reading.i'm giving four stars because this book interested me in the noetic science and provided me with a good time reading anyway.	1
	thanks mr. brown!      	1
	great read!.just finished the book this morning - i must blame dan brown on my lack of sleep the past few weeks...just as i knew would happen - i'd reach a point where i wanted to call it a night and head to bed, but mr. brown had other ideas.	1
	the story was interesting, i enjoyed following another langdon adventure, and i was impressed with the thought-provoking nature of the story!	1
	not often do i find myself doing side research while i read so that i can have a greater understanding of the background story, but this was one of those cases.	1
	as with many stories, there were portions that puzzled me, and parts i didn't necessarily enjoy, but in terms of the story overall - a fantastic read - one which i would happily read again!      	1
	another page-turner from dan brown!.once again,  dan brown keeps the pages turning!	1
	the plot constantly weaves and keeps one wondering who's on what side; dan brown has once again researched his topic in extreme detail; the information we learn about the inner workings of our national buildings and institutions is astounding; the villain is truly crazy and out of control, providing us an exciting ride through the entire book.	1
	well done once again, dan brown!	1
	!      	1
	a fun and exciting story, but more of the same.after six years, 'the lost symbol' -- author dan brown's long-awaited followup to his highly controversial international best-seller, 'the da vinci code' -- was released sept. 15 by doubleday books.	1
	the book continues brown's penchant for puzzles, conspiracies and arcane history, offering fans exactly what they've come to expect from his novels ... and nothing more.like all four of brown's previous novels, 'the lost symbol' follows symbologist robert langdon, as he's called to deliver a last -minute lecture in washington d.c. it doesn't take long for langdon to realize the real reason he was summoned, pulling him into a national security conflict that has him running for his life.anyone familiar with brown's predictable prose style will not be surprised with his latest work.	1
	much of formula behind 'the lost symbol' has been copied from books like 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code.'	1
	once again langdon is called upon for his unique knowledge of symbols and secret societies.	1
	here we replace paris (or rome) with washington d.c.; opus dei (or the illuminiati) with freemasons; sophie neveu (or vittoria vetra) with katherine solomon, and jacques sauniere (or leonardo vetra) with peter solomon.	1
	likewise, the archetype of silas -- the pale-skinned albino assassin from 'the da vinci code' -- is equally represented in 'the lost symbol' in the form of the grotesquely tattooed mal'akh.brown is often panned by critics for going back to the same formula again and again, and he makes no attempt to prove them wrong in 'the lost symbol.'	1
	say what you will, though, 'the da vinci code' alone has more than 80 million copies in print, and 'the lost symbol' has an additional 5.6 million copies (2 million reportedly sold in its first week).	1
	movies based upon his books have made $1.2 billion worldwide, and 'the lost symbol' is already planned to hit theaters in 2012. dan brown is worth an estimated $350 million.	1
	these are not the credits of an unsuccessful author.as formulaic as his books may in fact be, they are no less exciting.	1
	fans accept his predictable formula in exchange for feeding their love of intricate puzzles, conspiracies, secret societies, and odd historical facts (like knowing that the practice of wearing neckties came from roman orators who wore them to keep their throats warm before speaking).	1
	the story picks up quickly and his trademark short chapters help keep the reader turning pages, unable to set the book down.what really sets 'the lost symbol' apart from langdon's earlier adventures is that it's far more philosophical than we've seen before.	1
	the story focuses largely on man's relationship with god.	1
	it's less about outward answers and more about looking for god inside ourselves and man's own apotheosis.	1
	this philosophical turn may catch some readers off guard.what disappointed me most about 'the lost symbol' was simply that i didn't feel like it lived up to its predecessor.	1
	honestly, how could it?	1
	i was hoping for even more strange tidbits about our nation's capital, its history, and our political system.	1
	there certainly was a lot of that here, but not nearly as much as i had expected.	1
	i also didn't feel the threat was as menacing as it was in 'da vinci' or 'angels.'	1
	it takes the reader more than 400 pages to learn what the national security threat is (i felt it was overstated), and then it's quickly played out within the next 20 pages.	1
	to be fair, the national security threat isn't what keeps readers interested anyway.	1
	it's more of a secondary plot.	1
	the final 50 pages of the book are reserved for bringing closure to the characters themselves, without any conflict, mystery, danger, or controversy.	1
	it's a rather slow, boring, and anti-climactic process.	1
	it took me just as long to read the last 15 pages as it took to read the previous 495 because i was so bored i set it down and walked away for a few days.though not nearly as good as his previous novels, if you're already a fan of dan brown's endless oddities and can accept him for what he is, you probably will enjoy his latest work.	1
	if, however, you have trouble suffering his predictable, formulaic, and anticlimactic habits, you'll find little solace here.	1
	'the lost symbol' is little more than an unapologetic regurgitation of what dan brown does best.	1
	love it or leave it.	1
	portsmouth daily timesportsmouth, ohio; oct. 9, 2009      	1
	interesting, bit of a let down....i was fortunate enough to be one of the first few to check this out from the local library the morning it was released.	1
	i finished it this morning, and have to say it was not as good as brown's previous two langdon novels.	1
	entertaining--usually, educational in terms of d.c. landmarks--certainly, but less satisfying than i had anticipated.	1
	other reviewers have outlined enough of the storyline--i was bored and fidgety during the last few chapters, largely because i have no patience for authors who impose a lecture on spiritual philosophy as an ending in what is supposed to be a work of fiction.	1
	if i wanted that sort of thing i would read nonfiction books that are written as such.      	1
	more than the usual dan brown.as i began reading this i couldn't help but notice the similarities between the lost symbol and national treasure.	1
	as i continue, i felt like i was reading gods or monsters.	1
	even yet, as i arrived towards the conclusion, i honestly felt like it had turned into the secret (law of attraction).	1
	though i feel this is not what many readers may have in mind if they are familiar with the da vinci code or angels and demons.	1
	it can hold its own, but i wish dan brown would have finished the soloman key, unless this is it with a title change.	1
	then i wish he would have stuck with his usual style.	1
	if you are familiar with the secret as well as gods or monsters then i believe you may enjoy this... otherwise if you are reading this because you liked the da vinci code, then i would recommend something else.	1
	this is overboard compared to saying that jesus's bloodline has continued (as was the plot in the da vinci code) and that is saying alot!	1
	if you are reading this because you have likened 2012 with doomsday then get it!	1
	keep in mind though that '2012' is not the first time the mayan calendar has ended so it certainly won't be the last... henseforth any doomsday writings of 2012 just don't hold water even in the world of fantasy.	1
	it's just my opinion folks, it doesn't make me right.      	1
	interesting faction read on washington dc..i admit my husband and i had a hard time getting through the first two chapters: another dead body part in the midst of another revered location.	1
	but as we read further we both got hooked.	1
	brown seems to link the characters and the plot together a little better than in his first two books.	1
	it's also a great way to learn a little bit about wahington dc, especially if you haven't been there.	1
	we read the book with our lap tops by our sides, looking up photos of the various buildings, monuments, art work and sculptures mentioned in the book as we went.	1
	the lost symbol is a great 'faction' read and as good as any other source of mindless entertainment.      	1
	well researched  decent read.if douglas preston and lee child   james rollins, michael crichton or  clive cussler appeal to you than this should too.a bit lame at the end but a good read.      	1
	i enjoyed the book..i won't say it's a great book but it did hold my attention and i could not wait to find out what happens in the end.       	1
	entertaining novel!.	1
	once again robert langdon is the star of this dan brown novel.	1
	in this book langdon is called as a last minute spraker by his longtime friend and mentor peter solomon.	1

	a thrilling read - shouldn't expect anything less from brown.lost symbol deals with a family tragedy, brotherhood and the subject of man's enlightenment.	1
	it's a story that takes place in approximately a 12-hour timeline.	1
	and although i figured out the true identity of one of the main characters earlier than i had expected, the thrill never ceased.	1
	the facts about dc and the early masons are intriguing enough to want to do some research on your own.	1
	i've been to dc twice, visited the smithsonian museums and even stayed across the street from the wh, but after reading ls, i realized i've missed so much.	1
	this should definitely help bring tourism to the dc area.	1
	to all those considering purchasing this book, you will truly enjoy the read, learn how to decipher codes and want to learn more about dc and this country's 'founding fathers' and their role in the freemasons.	1
	btw, try deciphering the codes on the book's cover.	1
	what fun that was!	1
	spooky but exciting!.i thought the book was unique, spooky and exciting.	1
	it was hard to put down, and i was trying to solve the masonic secrets and puzzles all along.	1
	i even had my own theories about them as i read the book.	1
	dan brown's books are unusual novels in which teachings are slipped in.	1
	the teachings are deep and real food for thought.	1
	the the book was a bit too long, but other than that i found it fascinating.      	1
	disappointed.i'm disappointed that the roller coaster ride is over.	1
	there were so many twists and turns in this novel.	1
	i knew the tattoed man was evil but with several of the other characters brown had me changing my mind every few chapters.	1
	at one point i even suspected the old blind guy.	1
	:) i found myself talking to the characters.	1
	for instance, when katherine gave the cab driver the dollar bill on which she'd written i wanted to slap her for being so careless.	1
	i too fail to understand how the book got so many negative reviews.	1
	for me it was like watching a suspenseful movie and not knowing who the villians were until the very end.	1
	even at the end i was still holding my breath because i wasn't sure of peter's motives and thought something was going to happen to robert.	1
	i'll be rereading the da vinci code this weekend and then i'm going to revisit the lost symbol.	1
	i can't believe i want to reread it so soon after finishing it.	1
	hopefully this book will make it to the big screen.	1
	i can see it now.	1
	the camera pans up to the very tip of the washington monument, then slwoly moves down, deep into the earth below to reveal the lost symbol.      	1
	a fantastic page turner!.i must admit that i can't understand all the negative reviews of this book.	1
	in holding with angels and demons and the davinci code, this is another vintage langdon mystery brought to us by dan brown.	1
	nobody quite melds such different themes into a book like brown does; ancient mysticism, religion, masonic secrets and science.	1
	they were hallmarks of the first two robert landgon adventures and they're in the lost symbol in spades.	1
	langdon is summoned to washington dc to give a last minute lecture for a friend of his, peter solomon, head of the smithsonian institute and 33rd degree mason.	1
	what robert discovers when he arrived at the lecture however is something he couldn't have thought of in his wildest imagination.	1
	he finds his long time friend peter waiting for him, but only part of him.	1
	peter's severed hand along with a cryptic message left by a madman, peter's captor.	1
	what transpires after that and along the course of the book is true dan brown.	1
	riddles wrapped in mysteries, arcane rituals, ancient symbols, all leading on a hunt to find peter's abductor by the end of the night and unravel the mysteries of the lost symbol.	1
	brown didn't let me down with this one.	1
	while i thought angels and demons was the better of the two, both that and davinci code set a benchmark for this type of mystery.	1
	a tough act to follow indeed.	1
	but i think brown's third offering in the series is totally worthy of being held in the same regard as the preview two robert langdon books.	1
	in addition, the lost symbol (as well as the previous two) make the reader reconsider what's dogma in regards to religion and science.	1
	they make you reconsider paradigms that you've grown up with and have accepted for, quite likely, your whole life.	1
	that's the reaction i have to his books in any event.	1
	i devoured this book in short order because the subject matter was very interesting, as are the characters, and i just find dan brown has a great writing style.	1
	very fluid and always engaging.	1
	loved it!      	1
	worth the wait.despite what some people have said, i enjoyed this book.	1
	it was a little slow getting going i thought, but it eventually picked up and moved a long.	1
	for a kind of a no brainer page turner it is a good read.	1
	if you are expecting some sort of awesome revelation, you will probably be dissapointed.	1
	all in all, not too bad.	1
	then again i am easily amused.	1
	:))      	1
	historically fun.who knew?	1
	i am a native washingtonian, as are my parents and grandparents - but never knew the inscription on the washington monument.	1
	i worked on capitol hill for 15 years and never paid attention to the painting in the capitol - or it's meaning.	1
	this book is frightening, enlightening and fun.	1
	i think the other reviewers have become so jaded at reading their own reviews and believing they are actual 'critics' that they forget the object of reading is escape and fun.	1
	this is a great book and worth the price of admission.      	1
	great adventure!.i loved this book and could barely put it down.	1
	dan brown pulls through with the lost symbol.	1
	i think a lot of people are bummed out that it doesn't rank up with the da vinci code.	1
	but people, the da vinci code could possibly be dan brown's masterpiece.	1
	not too many author's have a book they can call their masterpiece so dan brown has a lot to live up to with his follow-up novel.	1
	if you love this genre of action and history, buy this book now.	1
	you won't be disappointed.       	1
	lots of problems but 4 stars for the sheer fun of it.this book ran the gamut of stars for me.	1
	if you just go with the flow and try not to get stuck on some of the questionable science and odd/illogical behavior or dialogue, you can really have fun with this book.	1
	if you get caught up with the problems, i am pretty sure this isn't the story for you.	1
	i'm usually too distracted by things like this and find them offputting, but for some reason i was able to put my doubts and criticisms on back-burner and just have fun trying to solve all the puzzles and be entertained with the cliffhangers and constant peril posed during this novel.	1
	the story timeline is just a few hours, although there are some references to things that happen before.	1
	first, a very brief no spoiler summary: we follow harvard symbologist  robert langdon, as he is (quickly) summoned to give a speech at the capital building by his close friend and mentor, peter solomon .	1
	he has also been asked to carry a container that peter always told him was precious and sacred to the masons.	1
	robert is not a mason, but peter is a very high-ranking one.	1
	from the very beginning, we know that things are going very wrong, and that there is this mysterious and obviously dangerous killer who intends on getting what's in that container.	1
	he also needs to have peter and robert solve the many puzzles that will lead to its use.	1
	what's very good with this book, is that there is plenty of foreshadowing that someone may be working with the bad guy.	1
	but we don't know who, so we mistrust everyone.	1
	it's a fast moving book that you will hate to put down, because the short chapters end on such cliffhangers.	1
	as with the da vinci code, i love the way dan brown educates us to the wonders that actually exist in our everyday cities and lives.	1
	he makes the puzzles so interesting and makes us want to try to figure them out on our own.	1
	i had never thought of washington dc as beings such a place full of esoteric temples for varied and ancient beliefs, and never realized our forefathers were so heavily involved in groups like the masons.	1
	i learned a lot from this book.	1
	but then again, this may lead to some of my criticism.	1
	the biggest problem with this book for me is this - there is an old expression in law enforcement that if you are in central park and you hear hooves, you don't think giraffes, you think horses.	1
	well, dan brown thinks giraffes, and that's obviously what makes parts of the books so exciting for readers however, it can also throw others  right out of the story.	1
	without giving anything away, i did not enjoy this book as much as the da vinci code, simply because i didn't think the 'mystery' gelled in the same way.	1
	i was fascinating by the theories in the da vinci code, and although i had a really lot of fun reading the lost symbol, the denouement  was a very different experience for me.	1
	there was also a part of the book where the viewers are mislead, in a way that i thought was unfair.	1
	can't say more without a spoiler, but if you read the book i think you'll know what i mean, and it has to do with the welfare of robert langdon.	1
	on the whole though, despite its problems, i gave this book 4 stars because i personally had a lot of fun reading it.	1
	also, if you are the kind of person that likes twists in their stories ( and i do), there is a great one that caught me looking near the end.	1
	if you were a fan of the da vinci code, i think you will enjoy this.	1
	if you want to learn about all the hidden symbols and ancient and varied religious beliefs and structures and practices that lie at the heart of washington dc.	1
	i think you will  be delighted - provided you remember that many of these fantastical visions and theories could quite easily have  different and far less exciting explanations.	1
	but where's the fun in that?       	1
	must compare as a book.the thing you need to remember, is this is a work of fiction.	1
	it should be judged against other works of fiction, not just judged against the davinci code.	1
	the davinci code was a great book because it let our imaginations run free and made us rethink how we view so many things.	1
	i do not think this book was as good as the davinci code, but i still give it a 5 because it is, on its own, a very well done work of fiction.	1
	it is quick paced and there's a few nice surprises in there, though one which the reader could tell was coming the whole way out.	1
	i enjoyed the lost symbol, and recommend it-  not as a life altering work, but as an very solid read which will make you smile some and rethink the usa a little bit.	1
	one reader said that the 'lost symbol' revelation at the end was wrong because it was faith specific and 'in front of us, but we can't see it'-  i think by reading words of peter in the book, you see it's very much not about faith, and the whole point is the thing you think is right in front of you, you're actually looking at incorrectly.      	1
	incredible read.dan brown is an incredible writer who sparks the senses with wonder and could it be's.	1
	his research, the history and his ability to carry multiple stories and events in one evening is amazing!	1
	keep up the good work -       	1
	the lost symbol.ugh ... well - i've read the trilogy, and this one was the worst.	1
	the ending was such a let down.	1
	i found that i couldn't wait to get through the book - not for more, but for it to end.	1
	very sad because i *loved* 'angels & demons' and 'the davinci code'.	1
	bummer ...      	1
	over written book-lost symbol could loose thousands of words!.this was one of the worst.	1
	author should have quit with davinci.	1
	he goes off on long winded tangents too many times and i found myself {to his credit} skipping pages and rushing to the end..mr. brown seems to have a preoccupation with claustrophobia and all his characters seemed boxed in.it seemed written with an eye toward hollywood and not d.c. this one not on my a list.        	1
	dan brown, master of deus ex machina?.as with other dan brown novels, the lost symbol is chock full of interesting (albeit sometimes debatable) historical, cultural and scientific information.	1
	the book tackles some really fascinating topics here.	1
	the story starts off great and dan brown really lays some great groundwork for what appears will be another epic story line.	1
	however, as the plot develops, he reaches too far for shock value and this causes the story's downfall.	1
	without playing spoiler, there are just too many 'oh, come on now!!'	1
	elements in the story.	1
	he overuses 'deus ex machina' as a tool to bring the story where he seems to think the readers what it to go...twists do not equal a good story and as a reader, i was fairly insulted by some of the absurd twists brown asks us to accept.	1
	i was entertained in the beginning but starting in the middle of the book, the story becomes redundant and absurd.	1
	i was rather unfulfilled.       	1
	maybe the movie will be better....save yourself the time and (if you're skeptically inclined as i am, the wince-inducing mystical clap-trap) and read  instead.	1
	you'll thank me for it, believe me.      	1
	a believable novel because much of it is true american history and fact.if our educators cannot get, or most likely will not, get the un- or undereducated masses to learn about the `true history of america' and its founding, then why not teach it to them through a great novel.	1
	i love dan brown novels.	1
	i've read them all.	1
	his stories, while chocked full of history and fact, are spellbinding and cliffhangers.	1
	while i am not a freemason, i have pondered the idea many times, because according to family legend, my paternal grandfather was a 33 mason of the scottish rite.	1
	and there are other family legends that other family members were also high degree masons.	1
	my greater family from southeastern kentucky (only one slice of my several race genes) originated from scotland in either the late 1700's or early 1800's by my paternal greatx4 grandfather john kelly, who himself may have been a high degree mason or highly influenced by freemasonry.	1
	i think it unnecessary to retell the storyline of this novel here, since other reviewers have written a more than perfect synopsis.	1
	however, i would like to just say this and that is that anyone reading this novel should not be so quick to dismiss the ideas presented between the lines as the mere fantastic imaginations of the author.	1
	america was founded upon the scottish rite masonic philosophy by high rank and file freemasons.	1
	in fact, the very cornerstone of our capitol building was laid in a masonic ceremony by 33 mason george washington while dressed in full masonic regalia.	1
	also, the symbology that proves our masonic founding beyond any shadow of a doubt is obvious on our currency, in our national seal and on all of the greco-roman architecture throughout washington d.c.  dan brown has illustrated this well, particularly as it pertains to our nation's capitol building.	1
	i repeat, i am not a freemason, but i have studied its philosophy for many years and hold it to be a precious asset and jewel hidden right in our midst.	1
	it contains the answers to almost all of the ancient prophesies pertaining to the way of the world, how things have been, are, and shall be; particularly those of revelation and nostradamus.	1
	for anyone desiring, after reading this book, to know more about the truth of freemasonry, rather than the lies and spin of `conspiracy theorists' should obtain this book and read and study it right along-side of scripture: .	1
	having done that, sometime in the not too distant future, you will remember and appreciate dan brown's wonderful and revealing stories about what's really going on in this `tired old world' and what has been promised from `on-high' to correct it.  	1
	great book.great book as only dan brown can do, i bought this on my kindle and had it finished in a couple of days.	1
	couldn't put it down for long, and spent a lot of time on the internet looking up places and statues in washington dc to follow the story line better.	1
	if you like the divinci code you will like this book.      	1
	a fully cognizant holographic 4 star read.ok, this review is from someone who's read the entire book!	1
	just finished it today.	1
	four stars in general, with nothing to make it a 5-star, quite a few 3-star situations and a couple 2-star moments.	1
	(ok, you could say the book earns the 5-star rating for simply making the information in this book so widely known and so high profile.	1
	dan brown's 'next book' was going to reach a great number of people regardless, and i can only agree with d.brown that the topics here are very interesting and well worth writing, well worth comparing or surpassing da vinci code in importance - read the book yourself and you may agree that the topic here is more important, though also quite harmonious, to the topics in da vinci code.)	1
	i thought it was quite an enjoyable and captivating read in general, and the information about the ancient mysteries, freemasons, washington area history and katherine's area of research were very interesting.	1
	as so many of us are so familiar with the da vinci code and angels and demons, it soon becomes obvious that dan brown has perhaps put too much of that same story structure or character type/arrangement in the lost symbol.	1
	but judging the book on it's own (which was tough in a few places, where i found myself thinking 'geez, brown, are you really doing this, it's so much of a repeat!	1
	), i don't think the book suffers from that in any major way.	1
	one fault i spotted and i have the same issue with most movies and books anyway, is that the creation of the 'bad' character lacks some believability.	1
	in a mystery thriller, obviously that character is going to provide energy that periodically forces the story along, meaning that authors find it too easy to exaggerate the evil characters and keep them superficial comic strip creatures.	1
	well, i found that issue here too.	1
	i would have liked the character there to be more of a reflection of social forces, but the reader is set up well to be able to reflect/extrapolate what those social forces might be.	1
	i've read other reviews here and the reviews giving 1-star and 2-star are just silly.	1
	again, dan brown is not a great literature writer but his capacity to entertain while revealing the fruits of lots of research into very important subjects and delivering a great mystery thriller are excellent.	1
	i can just imagine ron howard, dan brown and a few others sitting down over a few dozen rounds of coffee, scotch or orange juice and working out the movie version of this.	1
	long live the top of the washington monument!      	1
	worth the wait:  everything an intelligent thriller is supposed to be.when you've written a bunch of increasingly successful thrillers, the last one of which turns out to be a bookselling phenom, there must be an incredible amount of pressure on the follow-up.	1
	add in the fact that you revealed the topic of your next book by hiding clues in the jacket cover to your best-seller, giving everyone in the world the chance to guess at and try to gun-jump your thriller with their own freemason tale, and your task becomes even harder.	1
	add in a few lawsuits to distract you and, just maybe, make you a bit paranoid about worrying about who will sue over the next book, and the writing gets even harder.	1
	add in the security necessary to keep the details secret as you progress and life is even more complicated.	1
	yet, despite all this, dan brown has produced a new thriller that is everything that a thriller and a sequel is supposed to be.	1
	compelling, thrilling, familiar, yet surprising, the lost symbol was worth the wait and does not disappoint.	1
	the lost symbol is true to the spirit and the main character of angels & demons and the davinci code, yet builds on that fictional history and notoriety.	1
	the puzzles and symbols and and geographic mapping clues and chases we have come to know and crave are all there--mysteriously clever, yet still within grasp of the reading audience, at least when revealed (and a few before).	1
	there is a religious overlay to add a bit of controversy and there is suspense aplenty.	1
	sure, you may feel that some of the page-turning attributes are a bit constructed at times, but you still want to turn those pages to find out what happens next.	1
	there are twists and shocking surprises, i think, even bigger and better than in dan brown's previous books.	1
	more importantly, far from a mindless action-thriller, the lost symbol imparts scads of interesting information and actively encourages you to go read interesting books and discourses and to travel to interesting places.	1
	is the novel perfect?	1
	no.	1
	sometimes the characters do stupid things or don't figure something out as quick as you think they should.	1
	and the explanations by langdon can get a bit long-winded from time to time, especially nearer the beginning of the book.	1
	i'm also sure that websites are blossoming as we speak to quibble about this or that factoid or where some phrase or idea might have appeared before, but none of that detracts one iota from the fact that this is a tremendously interesting and compelling and educational and thought-provoking thriller that exceeds tremendously high expectations.	1
	at times, you can even catch brown making a bit of fun about himself and the past exploits of langdon.	1
	ignore the reviewers who nit-pick and publish spoilers and moan and groan about how the characters could have more depth or that the book is not as clever as they are, or who are obviously jealous of dan brown's success, but couldn't write a thriller half this good if their lives depended on it.	1
	the lost symbol is not literary, it is not a character study, it is not shakespeare.	1
	it is an intelligent, highly readable, page-turning thriller.	1
	i highly recommend it.      	1
	maybe the movie will be better.the reactions of the characters to various situations is beyond belief.	1
	the gore of the book puts this on a &#34;halloween&#34; movie level.	1
	maybe ron howard can improve it with the movie version.  	1
	not worth the wait!.certainly not worth the wait!	1
	the only good that may come out of this book would be an increase in washington, dc tourisim.	1
	hollywood, don't waste your time.      	1
	not great literature but definately a fun read!.the long-awaited lost symbol by dan brown has finally appeared.	1
	does it live up to its hype?	1
	yes!	1
	is it a fun read?	1
	yes!	1
	it is great literature?	1
	no, but it's not supposed to be.	1
	does it emulate brown's successful pattern from da vinci code and angels and demons?	1
	yes!	1
	is it predictable in that sense?	1
	sorta!	1
	will it make a fun movie?	1
	yes!	1
	it's not clear from some of the other reviews what some people were expecting, but they should know by now that brown is not another steinbeck, hemingway, wolfe, or melville, nor is he trying to be.	1
	he's a writer of fun-to-read novels that make the reader wonder about things around him or her.	1
	he probably isn't writing now because he needs the money (not after the success of his previous works!	1
	); he's apparently writing because it's as much fun for him as it is for us readers -- at least those of us who don't expect him to produce something that he isn't even trying to produce.	1
	so, sit down and enjoy it, but maybe after you align your expectations to what dan brown was trying to produce.	1
	you definitely won't fall asleep!	1
	and you'll learn some interesting things about our nation's capital, washington, dc, just as you learned things about london, paris, rome, and other european cities from his last two novels.	1
	europe definitely does not have a monopoly on mysteries!	1
	nor does the catholic church!    	1
	a page turner..it was good fun.	1
	an emotional ride thats twist and turns through d.c. it's not 'war and peace' and won't win a pulitzer, but hey, i just liked the fact that it was interesting, exciting, fast paced, and very entertaining.	1
	robert langdon's character lives on here to help the author fight the forces of darkness.	1
	was i expecting a major revelation from god?	1
	--no, just an escape from all the crap on tv.	1
	buy the book, or better yet, borrow it from someone who wrote a one or two star review because they won't care if you return it.	1
	i am keeping my copy thank you.      	1
	what a great read!.dan brown has done it again.	1
	it's always difficult to follow a big blockbuster with another, better, more exciting one; expecially one as potent as the davinci code; but i feel dan brown has done it here.	1
	for those who pooh-pooh the dialogue, seek more sex, or feel that the premise is unworthy; amazon has several hundred thousand alternatives.	1
	this is a terrific, historically intriguing, puzzle piece that brings to light hundreds of ancient symbols, legends, vocabulary, stories, people and places; all centered around our capital and the people ands the allegories stretching across thousands of years linking to those that founded our republic.	1
	what a tangled web of intrigue, history and emotional power.my pulse was racing and sleep relegated to some future point in time.    	1
	a little below expectations ...prosjust like any other dan brown book1.	1
	twists, turns2.	1
	maths, science3.	1
	secret societies, though i think why is it called secret when everybody knows everything about it.4.	1
	message within the book which is somewhat beyond its time.	1
	5. i particularly liked the choice of name for the characters, well thought.	1
	cons 1. mr brown you could have at least come up with a new shape for the plot, though this one isnt bad but knowing the shape already makes it less exciting specially after 4 books.2.	1
	sometimes it tries to give too much knowledge, that part was much more justified in dvc, with ls it seems more pushing down the throat.3.	1
	at times the books seems to be flattering the church and the masons.4.	1
	the end, i expected it to be dull just like any other db book, but this was seriously disappointing.	1
	maybe it is mr. brown's signature or something which he does not want to change.	1
	judgement mr. brown needs to come up with a new formula if he wants to keep making the millions he does now.      	1
	this is the worst one yet.friends, do yourselves a favor and don't waste money on this one of dan brown's.	1
	i would say i was disappointed, but honestly, i wasn't expecting much to begin with, and for that matter didn't get much out of reading this book.	1
	whereas the davinci code was filled with at least useful/interesting tidbits about various locations, word origins, religious history along the journey, this book provides only a little bit of that for about 5 chapters during their escapade in the us capitol building, and then descends into rambling bull about spiritualist nonsensical gibberish, interspersed with some strained plot devices.	1
	at times, i could see whole plot segments lifted out of his previous works, like angels and demons.	1
	i.e.	1
	chase scenes in a high security area, and who the antagonist actually turns out to be, etc.	1
	honestly, i found myself skipping through several pages at a time when i could see they involved long dissertations on the pseudo-religious/spiritualist crap that has little relevance to the story.	1
	finally, the story/plot line is a little bit contrived even for dan brown action sequences.	1
	and there is a heavy tinge of deus-ex-machina going on here, with plot predicaments rescued by non-sequitur technology or just ignoring what happened two pages before.	1
	the final resolution of the secret was also pretty lame, like a bad coffee after a mediocre meal.	1
	for those in the know, don't waste your money -- just pick up the free copy on bittorrent...       	1
	thought provoking!.this is one of the most interesting books i have ever read.	1
	great read, keep an open mind.	1
	i felt this book was uplifting and spiritual.      	1
	great, entertaining book.the book was very entertaining.	1
	many people on here seem to be analyzing the book to much and delving into subtle intricacies that supposedly make the book stupid.	1
	my advice: just read the book!!	1
	stop over-analyzing it.	1
	it was written to be purely a fun and entertaining read, and it does just that!      	1
	great story.this was a great book, totally unexpected ending.	1
	i think the most important part of this book was the message it presented at the end.	1
	a message that everyone needs to remember, most of all the people that run our government.      	1
	sooooo disappointing.i am really annoyed with myself.	1
	i finished dan brown's new book and i do not know why i did not stop after 100 pages.	1
	it was just awful.	1
	way too much information, in a very lecturing kind of way.	1
	it was as if he had an outline for a really good thriller, and then he awkwardly inserted all this information.	1
	as if he wrote the info on sticky notes and then just put them on the pages of his outline, willy nilly.	1
	another review said it better than i 'dan brown chooses to use langdon's inner monologues to tell us every single piece of research he's done for this book.	1
	instead of weaving it into the story he decides to tell us everything rather than showing it to us.'	1
	the endless pages of detail about masons and about noetic science......snore!	1
	btw, i liked every other book of his, even the early ones without robert langdon.	1
	i actually fell asleep twice while reading the lost symbol....something i never do!	1
	i was just reading some other reviews of this book at another site and came upon this one, which made me lol 'is it still vaguely enjoyable in the way only a dan brown book can be?	1
	yes.	1
	does dan brown's copy editor need to be publicly humiliated?	1
	yes and his name is apparently jason kaufman (according to the acknowledgements, so i'm not like, stalking anyone here)  also, if i ever have to read the words 'neutered sex organ' again, i will be forced to remove my eyeballs and then pour bleach directly onto my brain.'	1
	i could not have said it better, so i won't.       	1
	worthy successor meets high expectations.summary: this book is great, fastpaced entertainment with shocking moments and with a storyline which also encourages to think.	1
	the combination of interesting characters, great story line, science, mystic, religion, action, symbolism, riddle solving, history and a great ending generates another great ride, that nobody should miss.	1
	here now some details: contains no spoilers!!!	1
	the fun about reading the book is not knowing what the book is about.	1
	therefore this review does not contain any spoilers, but instead gives some general impressions.	1
	after the huge success of 'the da vinci code' i doubted that dan brown could repeat that success and could come up with another great story of such magnitude.	1
	after such a great success, authors often come up quickly with their next story.	1
	not dan brown.	1
	he took several years to research and fine tune a story which turned out (again) to be a thrilling ride with fascinating characters, strong story line and shocking revelations and which stands worthy next to his other two stories featuring robert langdon.	1
	some key aspects, that i loved: (1) the character of mal'akh was very well done.	1
	excellent character with great background.	1
	shocking!	1
	(2) the writing style is similar to james patterson.	1
	very short chapters of normally 2-4 pages.	1
	that makes it almost impossible to lay the book down .... one more chapter .... one more chapter ... and another 3 hours are gone.	1
	great entertainment and great style.	1
	that also helps the author to switch easily between up to three parallel storylines which are important for the story.	1
	(3) the whole story plays again (like in angels and daemons) in a short time frame (this time around 12 hours) which generates a high pace feeling like in the tv show 24.	1
	(4) the book has some shocking moments which are unforgettable and i did not know how dan brown could solve it, but he did it in a form which was believable.	1
	one moment almost at the end was so shocking and surprising that the book almost fell out of my hands.	1
	not many authors have done that to me.	1
	(5) a great tourist guide.	1
	while reading the book, i wished i would be on site and could read the book at the actual locations where it takes place.	1
	the lost symbol is for washington, what angels and daemons was for rome and what the the da vince code was for paris.	1
	i can already envision lost symbol tours.	1
	(6) believable and fulfilling ending.	1
	quite some often, authors raise a lot of expectations in the first few hundred pages of their books, but then do not find a way how to get the story to a fulfilling ending.	1
	not here.	1
	i loved the ending.	1
	it makes sense and all storylines closed to my full satisfaction, some with big surprises.	1
	summary: this book is great entertaining with shocking moments and which also encourages to think.	1
	the combination of interesting characters, science, mystic, religion, action, symbolism, history and a great ending generates another great ride, that nobody should miss.	1
	magnificent!!	1
	!.dan brown has the unique ability to weave fiction around truth.	1
	if only he could write school text books such as history, georgraphy, and literature with his talent for truth weaved through them.	1
	the students would have no problem remembering what they are supposed to be learning.      	1
	a truly transformative literature.although i do agree with some of the negative comments about this book, but they are only of surface values.	1
	most don't realize the transformative message written in this piece of literature... that we are each a god or goddess only to be realized by ourselves... that all religions are fundamentally united by this message.	1
	if more people in the world understand or believe in this idea, then this world we live in can truly become a better place.	1
	my personal revelation is this: eden is whereever we are, whereever people are connected to each other, have respect for each other, whereever we each truly understand ourselves, whereever people realize our relationship toward each other is what makes our world a paradise.      	1
	great book!.i think this is a great book!	1
	in my opinion the lost symbol is just as good as the da vinci code and angels and demons.	1
	this book is a real page-turner.	1
	i actually like the short chapters because dan brown always leaves you wanting to read the next chapter and find out what happens next.	1
	that is why his books are page-turners.	1
	i am definitely satisfied with this book!       	1
	a lost opportunity.the lost opportunity    in the year 2005, dan brown released his fourth novel, the da vinci code.	1
	it soon became a world-wide sensation, outsold only by j.k. rowling's fifth harry potter novel, order of the phoenix.	1
	still, the da vinci code is one of the most widely read books ever written.	1
	clearly brown hit on some sort of secret formula of entertainment.	1
	the question is, can he do it again?	1
	does his latest novel and code follow-up, the lost symbol, live up to the legacy?	1
	well, yes...unfortunately.	1
	the first thing one notices about this book is the jacket.	1
	simply put, this book is beautiful.	1
	the seal of the masonic scottish rite is stamped in red 'wax', directly above the capitol building in washington, d.c., which can be seen through a pyramidal rip in yellowed parchment.	1
	layers of arcane symbols cover nearly every inch of the jacket, and the washington monument is visible through a keyhole on the spine.	1
	nearly everything on the jacket has a meaning, including several hidden puzzles that the clever reader can decipher.	1
	they say not to judge a book by its cover, but if an exception was made for the lost symbol, then it would be a literary masterpiece.	1
	but who cares how the book looks?	1
	what really matters is the story.	1
	every dan brown novel centers on a secret society and its, well, secrets.	1
	this time it's the freemasons, a world-wide organization whose roots stretch all the way back to the ancient egyptians, and whose members range from your grandpa to the president of the united states (pick your favorite, they were all masons).	1
	the freemasons, however, are not so much a secret society as they are a 'society with secrets', secrets that people would kill for.the story starts with the usual shadowy ceremony, this time a mysterious tattooed man named mal'akh being inducted into the 33rd degree of freemasonry (this being the highest possible level).	1
	but, of course, mal'akh has sinister, ulterior motives, as can be deduced by such interior monologues as, 'they have opened their doors to me,' and 'soon you will lose that which you hold most dear.'	1
	despite being something of a cookie-cutter villain, mal'akh is actually quite terrifying, with an intriguing back story and a knack for really ruining your day.	1
	he's also really full of himself, as can be deduced by such interior monologues as, 'i am a masterpiece.'	1
	mal'akh does a lot of interior monologues.the story then jumps to returning harvard 'symbologist' (no, there is no such thing) and lover of turtle necks, robert langdon.	1
	langdon receives an urgent call from his old mentor peter solomon and is asked to come to washington, d.c. right away, where he is needed to give an emergency presentation on (whom else?)	1
	the freemasons.	1
	he catches the next flight and speeds off.	1
	naturally things don't go too well.	1
	one kidnapping, severed hand and sinister phone call later, langdon is racing against a 12-hour clock to rescue peter solomon by solving the ancient mysteries of the freemasons, all for the benefit of mal'akh.brown's work has  been accused of using the exact same template, and the lost symbol is no exception.	1
	the great thing about the lost symbol, however, is that it manages to make a tired formula new and exciting.	1
	the tone and pace are tense and urgent as langdon struggles to sort out the web of deception in order to save his mentor.	1
	the situations mal'akh puts the characters through are nerve-wracking and sometimes disturbing.	1
	the puzzles and codes, being brown's specialty, are excellently crafted and immensely fun to try and solve before langdon.	1
	then there are the locations.	1
	from the masonic temple to the smithsonian museum, each place that langdon visits is a real location in washington, and each is a fantastic set piece described in wonderful detail.	1
	lots of surprising facts are revealed about the nation's capitol city.	1
	in fact, the entire story is full of detail that never becomes too overwhelming.	1
	there are also some small secrets (try dialing the phone number langdon is given early in the story) and nods to the fans (a mention of one of brown's earlier novels) that can be found throughout the story.it's unfortunate, then, that the worst part is the ending.	1
	the lost symbol commits the same crime as the da vinci code, by rewarding readers with--well, nothing.	1
	after the intense chase across washington, after the deception and puzzle solving, when the ancient mysteries are finally revealed they don't live up to the grand name.	1
	the trouble gone through just doesn't seem worth it.	1
	not only that, but the story rambles on when it feels like it should have ended 37 pages ago.	1
	the action comes to an abrupt halt, and suddenly the characters begin to wax philosophical.	1
	there's nothing wrong with some depth to a story, but the message mr. brown tries to convey seems to have been lost in translation.	1
	even langdon is left scratching his head at the confusing conjecture.	1
	it's tempting to recommend that readers simply stop reading after the final confrontation, but that would leave loose ends.	1
	it's a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise great story.the lost symbol could have been better than the da vinci code, and in some ways it is; the writing is better, the story is more skillfully crafted (and more historically accurate), and there's lots more action.	1
	but it ultimately loses points for an unsatisfactory finish and several pages of pointless rambling.	1
	read the book and enjoy the ride, just don't expect too much at the end. 	1
	very entertaining!.i don't really understand the negative reviews.	1
	this was a fast-paced, interesting story, that captured the essence of one of my favorite cities perfectly.	1
	i wasn't expecting a davinci code rehash.	1
	this book peaked my interest in the freemasons, and i will be taking a 'lost symbol' tour when i go back to d.c. for the winter holidays.	1
	noetic science is an amazing study - i got so much more out of this book than anticipated.	1
	it was entertaining, and led me on some research paths.	1
	what more can one ask for?      	1
	caca.poorly written  bad plot bloated  stupid premise  i would suggest dawkins if you want the real story.	1
	very disappointing followup to previous &#34;stories&#34;      	1
	dan brown revealed.after three very moderately successful books - the second of them already featuring robert langdon - in late 2001 dan brown  started to write his fourth novel.	1
	he used the same patterns as before (a weird bad guy, a 'dangerous' secret, a female expert, and so on).	1
	not much was to be expected.	1
	but he had had a piece of good fortune.	1
	reading by chance a well known book, he had stumbled across  a very good idea for his plot.	1
	to his eternal surprise,  and  to the everlasting amazement  of everybody who knew him,  he wrote the infamous da vinci code.	1
	his appalling shortcomings as a writer and a 'researcher' were all there for the world to see, but the average readers appreciated that novel so much that they did not care.	1
	a star was born.	1
	but one cannot grow big and strong out of sheer good luck.	1
	despite all the hype and all the hopes  of those who make money from his works,  dan brown remains what he used to be: a  below-average commercial writer who can bring forth  just one story and repeats it over and over again,  a writer who totally disregards facts and truth and fills his books with nonsense,  a man who  lacks any respect for his  readers  and - i daresay - even for himself.	1
	as so many reviewers have pointed out,  the lost symbol is exactly what was to be expected from dan brown: a novel whose weaknesses soar beyond belief.	1
	has the star lost his light?	1
	it should have.	1
	but marketing and public relations are very powerful tools.	1
	they could add weight to a soul, even to a dead one.    	1
	a call to action for mankind.	1
	first of all i want to express my  gratitude to dan brown for writing this book, a truly consequential masterpiece.	1
	for me, this book really struck a cord,  it fused a lot of the research i have carried out over the years into a coherent and interesting tale.	1
	the story brown relays expresses the true power of the human being, especially in light of the esoteric truths veiled behind religious dogma.	1
	brown's use of freemasonry was perfect, a brotherhood of men dedicated to the innate power of the human, and human race, and the responsibility to use this power for the benefit of mankind.	1
	also brown's use of the united states of america was perfect, a nation forged by masonic ideals, that would allow man to be free to develop into his true majesty.	1
	i could see why many people would not like the book, because it is heavy, and lays down some very strong ideas that could damage a persons ideological worldview.	1
	by connecting noetic sciences with ancient mystical traditions, brown effectively shows the potent force of human perception,and the long held secret science of how to develop this perception.	1
	he points especially toward working in unison ( e pluribus unum) to create tremendous change in the physical world (mathew 18:20).	1
	the power of enlightened man is not a new idea and is actually one this country was founded on.	1
	i loved every inch of this book and it is really a profound and compelling read which makes one rethink their place in the world.	1
	don't ye know ye are gods?       	1
	meh....having been a big fan of the dvc, this book pales in comparison.	1
	and, quite frankly, i don't think it will generate the hype - or accompanying sales - that dvc did.	1
	those who are not americans will have a difficult time following the information on buildings, landmarks, and other 'americana'.	1
	and i'm not sure they will even be interested, since they will probably have to look many things up as they read along.	1
	the story is patterned after his other novels, which is getting old (at least for me.)	1
	the story does not gain momentum until a quarter of the way through - and the pace of the narrative drags with brown 'info-dumping' many irrelevant facts.	1
	overall, the story is 'just okay' - not really that interesting.	1
	it does not have the power or controversy  of dvc.	1
	at least in dvc, the reader was able to decipher some of the codes along with langdon such as anagrams, the mirror writing and the codes inn caesar's box.	1
	the codes in tls were too obvious (such as certain pseudonyms), and brown also employed the 'pigpen cipher' (more recently known as the 'freemasons code.')	1
	but it's what we learned in elementary school as children to decipher encrypted writings!	1
	i would not recommend this book, and beleive it to be way overhyped.	1
	and, now that i think of it, it actually was reminiscent of 'national treasure!'	1
	best of the three.i was shocked to see so many negative reviews for this book.	1
	both the writing and the story are better than brown's previous attempts, though there are still a few annoying bugs in his style.	1
	i'm extremely pleased that brown finally learned how to write compound sentences.	1
	his other works are choppy enough to be distracting, but here the narrative flows smoothly, allowing the reader to become truly immersed in the story.	1
	i found 'the lost symbol' to be just as much of a page-turner as brown's previous novels, if not more.	1
	honestly, i have no idea why so many people had trouble with the pacing.	1
	yes, he uses an obvious trick - short, punchy chapters with cliffhangers at the end - but it's exactly the same thing he's done in his other works.	1
	surely we were all expecting that?	1
	as for the subject matter, it felt like a surprising and yet natural progression of the philosophy presented in the first two books.	1
	i actually found it quite inspiring, even - or perhaps especially - as an atheist.	1
	best of all, the story motivated me to continue my own research on several topics, ranging from science and art to philosophy and religion - and it's certainly decided my next vacation destination for me!	1
	highly, highly recommended.      	1
	le sigh..i know you like money, dan, but please, just please stop.	1
	you're really hurting english speaking literature here.        	1
	when a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down, medicine go down.....i just finished reading dan browns latest novel, and i couldn't put it down.	1
	on the surface, this book is about robert langdon (as we know him from 'the da vinci code'), somehow getting involved with the freemasons in a frantic race spanning a time period of 12 hours, chasing all over washington dc at night, while deciphering ancient symbols and codes,solving mysterious riddles, and fighting the ultimate villain, a mortal guy with a brilliant but sick brain turned monster.	1
	the plot is somewhat similar to the `da vinci code' granted, what we learn here about freemasonry is fascinating.	1
	ultimately though, this story is about ancient philosophies and forgotten messages and wisdoms that bite us in the nose every day where ever we look, and the regrettable fact that most people are not open minded enough these days to be able to perceive them.	1
	he confronts us with the common but arrogant assumption that the 21st century and its technology and achievements is mankind at its peak.	1
	we are encouraged to consider the idea that ancient philosophies and cultures might have been well ahead of modern knowledge, and that cutting edge science is just about to catch up with what in essence has already been known millenniums ago.	1
	this resonates with me.	1
	i was lucky enough to have a teacher in high school who introduced us to einstein's special theory of relativity, heisenberg's uncertainty principle, all rounded up with a nice background in philosophy.	1
	i have a masters degree in science, but philosophies and religions from all  over the world kept fascinating me until today.	1
	so dan browns idea is simple: take all this heavy food for thought and wrap a nice, fast paced suspense thriller around it that people can easily enjoy and dismiss as pure entertainment.	1
	the author himself is pulling his own leg a little when putting the reader in langdon's shoes, the skeptical scientist: `ironically this same code had been a plot twist in a mediocre thriller langdon had read years ago'.	1
	this book has to be read between the lines if you want to understand what the author wants to get across.	1
	here is what he really wants folks to think about: quote 'from the crusades, to the inquisition, to american politics - the name jesus had been hijacked as an ally in all kinds of power struggles.	1
	since the beginning of time, the ignorant had always screamed the loudest, herding the unsuspecting masses and forcing them to do their bidding.	1
	they defended their worldly desires by citing scripture they did not understand.	1
	they celebrated their intolerance as proof of their convictions.	1
	now, after all these years, mankind had finally managed to utterly erode everything that had once been so beautiful about jesus'.	1
	and i can see why it dan brown six years to finish this novel, he poured an enormous amount of research into this book.	1
	while the plot is fiction, the facts for the most part are not.	1
	i couldn't help but google along on my computer as i read, and many times the search results left me flabbergasted.	1
	read this book open minded, as the wisdom within is hidden in a big spoonful of sugar.	1
	not many of us like bitter medicine straight up after all ;-)      	1
	dan brown knocks the ball out of the park again!.yep, mr. brown's newest book, the lost symbol, is a very worthy addition to his bibliography.	1
	in 'the lost symbol,' symbolist robert langdon is on a mission to find a masonic pyramid containing a code that unlocks an ancient secret to 'unfathomable power.'	1
	it's a story of hidden history in the nation's capitol, with masons the greatest puzzle of all.	1
	the freemasons date back to the middle ages, to associations of workmen who built cathedrals in britain, though some also believe in a connection to ancient times with the mines where king solomon took material for his temple.	1
	freemasonry has endured, and transformed.	1
	the british began to accept members who were not stonemasons and by the 1700s, lodges were being called 'speculative,' philosophical societies rather than worker guilds.	1
	the book features small, easily readable chapters and is a classic brown-style page-turner.	1
	six years of research and an amazing passion for writing is apprent from the first page to the last.	1
	if you're a big brown fan like me, you'll appreciate that i'm not going to divulge any spoilers to would-be readers.	1
	check it out for yourself...you will not be disappointed.	1
	highly recommened!      	1
	boring boring boring.what a giant disappointment.	1
	no story, boring topic (the history channel has better info), improbable antogonist, repetitive beyond reason.	1
	a guy gets his hand cut off and doesn't seem to lose any blood, or go into shock or anything...just races around dc and climbs a lot of stairs.	1
	please.	1
	a 'mystery thriller'?	1
	a note to tom hanks (who was miscast to begin with): skip it!      	1
	breathtaking !!	1
	!.most readers should pay attention to the knowledge transmitted not only to the plot... this is an extremely powerful book.	1
	a mind opener!!	1
	!         	1
	don't waste your money!.aside from the fact that this book has a number of typos, i was seriously disappointed with the whole story line.	1
	it was overly predictable and the dialogue often sounded forced.	1
	the book also abounded with pseudoscience and religious propaganda.	1
	i used to enjoy dan brown's books (taken at a fictional value), but this one just made me annoyed to the point that it was not enjoyable.      	1
	nothing lost, everything gained with lost symbol.like millions of americans, i loved the davinci code.	1
	i read that sucker in 3 days!	1
	and, like millions of americans, i was less than thrilled with dan brown's other titles.	1
	so, it was with sincere trepidation that i ordered the lost symbol.	1
	in a word, the lost symbol is fabulous.	1
	i sped read it in 3 days and had to make myself put it down to get some sleep.	1
	i highly recommend this book to davinci code fans - it will thrill you to the core.      	1
	utter waste of time.i've read some of dan brown's other books including the da vinci code and thought for the most part it was entertaining cheese.	1
	this book, however, is terrible.	1
	did he get paid by the italicized word, the improperly used ellipse and exclamation point?	1
	if he did then he is a fabulously rich man.	1
	the further you get along in the book, the worse it is.	1
	i could barely finish the last chapter because every other sentence was italicized to connote the great import (sorry, i don't know how to do italics on amazon) of the great wisdom, which no one has ever thought about before!!!	1
	i'm pretty sure that it's possible to discuss philosophical subjects in a way that conveys depth without having to end each chapter with an exclamation point.	1
	plato managed to write entire books without relying on punctuation to get his point across.	1
	the science, history and philosophy are sloppy and ridiculous.	1
	a man suffers a horrific accident and the hospital just lets him go after an hour or so?	1
	with what?	1
	a couple of tylenol and good wishes that he doesn't become terribly infected?	1
	a harvard scholar who studies ancient texts claims he doesn't really know that much about the bible?	1
	and for the love of god (see what i did there?!!!)	1
	einstein was an atheist and i'm pretty sure he'd appreciate it people would stop perpetuating the myth that he had some deathbed conversion to deism.	1
	finally, the message that this books attempts to convey is too shallow and laughable for even oprah to feature on one of her secret shows.	1
	keep on believing in your press dan brown because this book makes it obvious ... that you do!!!!!	1
	! 	1
	as god as or even better than the davinci code.fisrt off let me say that all of these reviews complaining of the content of the book as boring and long and not worth reading, i whole-heartedly disagree.	1
	this book was as riveting and esoteric as the davinci code if not more so.	1
	i couldn't put it down.	1
	i received it on friday afternoon and finished it on sunday afternoon.	1
	mr. brown's knowledge of his subject matter is very accurate and very concise.	1
	although there is some information that is not entirely correct the book is great entertainment and well researched.	1
	having visited washington d.c. i could see in my minds eye all the places described in the book.	1
	his desriptions are very accurate and the characters are beliveable.	1
	as usual there is an unexpexted twist at the end.	1
	this book is definitely worth your time and money.	1
	great job mr. brown!      	1
	great entertainment.see all book summaries above.as a big thriller reader and one of dan brown's biggest fans i was more than happy with this go round.	1
	it has everything a dan brown fan comes to expect.	1
	a well researched look into history and the sciences.	1
	the way these are layed out in novel form is one of brown's talents.	1
	you may not agree with everything he writes, and i think some people will give it a bad review because of this, but he can enthrall me like few authors can.	1
	with mysteries from the past to the present, dan brown fans will not be disappointed.	1
	top notch entertainment and enlightenment all the way.	1
	from inside:'nothing is hidden that will not be made known; nothing is secret that will not come to light.'	1
	rubbish.those looking for a plot synopsis simply look at the back of the novel you're going to read.	1
	if that doesn't wet your appetite, then simply follow the same formula that dan brown has been implementing in his books for years.	1
	take your hero (robert langdon) add an ancient/ mysterious cult group that is evil and trying to destroy civilization don't forget a dash of some femme fatale love interest and there you have it 'the lost symbol' in a nut shell.	1
	oops i forgot to add the horrible writing and uninspiring characterization.	1
	it doesn't bother me that the book was so bad.	1
	i kind of expected it after 'angels and demons' was a complete mirror image of the 'da vinci code'.	1
	what irks me is that this book will sell millions of copies and not deserve all of its acclaim.	1
	i'm all for people buying books and resurrecting the dying book business.	1
	what i don't appreciate is that it takes a book as bad as this to do it.	1
	save your money and time and just re-read the 'da vinci code.'	1
	another page turner from dan brown!.formulaic or not, if you have enjoyed brown's previous books, you will enjoy this one too.	1
	the amount of research that goes into his books is astounding to me, and like his other books the subject matter is fascinating.	1
	i am always left wanting to learn more about his topics and wondering where the lines are between fact and fiction.	1
	i raced through this book and am getting ready to read it again to pick up more details that i know i missed the first time around.	1
	the kindle version was pretty good format-wise, better than most i have read.      	1
	small minds make for bad reviews.it's fiction people...it's supposed to be far fetched.	1
	but what it's really supposed to do is make you open up your mind and think.	1
	the davinci code was a hit, and it had it's underlying religiousity, so what is it that is pushing people to rate this book so badly?	1
	nothing but the idea that religion is not what everyone has been taught that it is.	1
	*gasp*  open your minds people.	1
	see what is in front of you and what is not in front of you to see.	1
	does this not seriously make people question what they thought they knew?	1
	that's the point behind his works.	1
	to make you really sit back and wonder if what he writes could be possible.	1
	it's called expanding your intellect.	1
	as for all the info about the masons, the conspiracy theories drummed up through the ages are exactly what brown calls them to be.	1
	the masons have been an easy target because of their policies regarding handling situations that place them hand in hand with what are supposed to be the countries greatest conspiracy plots.	1
	this is fiction.	1
	read it with an open mind.	1
	noetics is actually a practiced science, the masons really aren't horrible people planning on taking over the world, and this book should make you take stock in your surroundings and the things you thought you knew.	1
	read it for what it is, and enjoy it.	1
	he's an author with a serious talent, and there aren't a ton of those anymore....      	1
	the lost symbol - literally wonderful.dan brown's the lost symbol is a fun, freaky, fantastic read.	1
	i enjoyed learning more about all the symbolism incorporated into the buildings in washington dc, about the hopes of our nation's founders for a society based on knowledge, wisdom and spirituality.	1
	brown is brilliant, a great storyteller with an inspiring story to tell.	1
	though i rarely re-read books, i will read the lost symbol again someday because, even as i raced through the story, propelled by the thrilling adventure and so many secrets revealed, i found many instances where i knew there was more: layers of meaning, circles in circles.       	1
	not good at all..even if you (like me) have in the past been willing to look past dan brown's atrocious prose because you enjoy the facts and pseudo-revelations and plots in his books, you won't like this one.	1
	the writing is still just as bad, the plot points and characters unbelievably cookie-cutter formulaic, and the content is just sludgy, preachy, and boring.       	1
	lost patience.i have read all of dan brown's books and i enjoy the way he writes and tells the story, the books progress as if we're watching a movie unfold, and i like that.the lost symbol however, should be renamed lost patience, a word that will change the world?	1
	come on!	1
	give me a break.	1
	wasting hundreds of pages do decrypt a pyramid full of secret codes, only to find out about a word, a symbol, the washington monument, and the potential of the human mind.	1
	are you serious?the lost symbol is like a bad sequel that should never have hit the theaters.      	1
	don't waste your money and definitley not worthy of hanks/howard.the first 80% of the pages of meaningless foreplay, then a 10-page unsatisfying climax, followed by a dull 50 pages of epilogue.	1
	this book was long awaited and greatly hyped, but unfortunately, it did not live up to that hype.	1
	this book starts out slow by broaching the subject of freemasons and the power they hold in the u.s. then it quickly develops into a chase and riddle solving game, which at every turn produces an unsatisfying result showing us how desperate brown was to follow up his success of the da vinci code.	1
	now that i've wasted 10 hours of my life reading this, i'm tempted never to return to this thriller genre of brown/patterson/cook/koontz and the other mediocre misfits.	1
	sigh, i wish chrichton were still alive to show these guys how to write a real novel.	1
	i'm not even going to bother with the movie (sorry tom hanks, you're great but this book sucks), this book was so dull.      	1
	national treasure reprised.a disappointing and predictable novel that isn't novel at all.	1
	save your money and your time.       	1
	the power of hope.let us use the noetic power of our collective minds to force dan brown to write a better book.        	1
	thought provoking and controversial  - typical dan brown.i just finished reading this latest offering from dan brown and it made me smile.	1
	i was somewhat surprised to see the number of negative reviews but after reading a number of them, the reasons are obvious.	1
	i think a number of readers just wanted an entertaining read without any thought provocation.	1
	in that regard, the lost symobol may have fallen a little short.	1
	on the other hand.	1
	the narrow minded christian fundamentalists had their beliefs challenged and reacted negatively, as is to be expected.	1
	da vinci code was more blatantly and obviously more controversial because of the subject matter.	1
	i am sure that is why it is currently the best selling novel of all time.	1
	however, the lost symbol is equally controversial, if the reader actually takes the time to think about the message of this book.	1
	dan brown's attention to detail and his ability to weave a number of disparate and seemingly unrelated and insignificant symbols into a thought provoking story line, never ceases to amaze me.	1
	as other reviewers have already commented, i too had to google along, in order to get a better understanding of the subject material.	1
	i have no problem with that, and found it to be a very enlightening experience.	1
	is the lost symbol formulaic?	1
	yes does it detract from the message?	1
	not at all !	1
	it seems that we live in a time where readers and movie goers seem to just crave pure eye brow raising and adrenaline rushing entertainment, in order to escape from the trials and tribulations of their daily lives.	1
	they  have no desire to be left with anything to think about; that is just too much work.	1
	for those of you in that category, i would recommend a marvel comic book.	1
	i found the lost symbol an interesting read, and although i am not a religious person, i am tempted to read the bible again, but from a totally different perspective.       	1
	a nice read.similar in style to the da vinci code, this new tale is an engaging yarn which kept me hooked until i finished.	1
	some of the premises and extrapolations are far-fetched and wishful thinking, but the pace of the book keeps you engaged.       	1
	word evolutionist.9/19/09 (embedded mystical numbers of course) finished the 'lost symbol' - all 770 (embedded mystical numbers of course) pages of it!	1
	think you'll like it very much.	1
	a real page turner.	1
	ah, the joys of turning those pages late into the night.	1
	cleverly created story.	1
	have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	enjoy seeing his storytelling craft develop.	1
	did i read the same book as the people giving it a poor review?	1
	this was my favorite.	1
	anthony's bobby, word evolutionist      	1
	a very poor sequel.dan brown is living off the reputation of his last book.	1
	i found very little mystery and a large serving of muddled thinking regarding religion and mankind.	1
	read this book if you must and i hope you are not as disappointed as i was.      	1
	important messages.i loved the lost symbol.	1
	as i read the novel, i kept thinking of the grief that dan brown will receive for what i see as a bold move.	1
	the davinci code made dan brown a well known author.	1
	rather than writing a book that relied on his fame, brown uses mass media and fiction to motivate people to think.	1
	the lost symbol, challenges the reader to - look at things differently, read with an open mind, consider the potential of the ideas covered.	1
	i hope that in addition to enjoying the fast pace, absorbing plot, interesting characters and fascinating facts, readers look at the underlying messages.          	1
	opt for 'mightier than the sword'.honestly, i think dan brown's best book was 'angels and demons'.	1
	note the word 'book' not movie.	1
	but some of his critics are too harsh.	1
	yes arguably the ending of 'the lost symbol' was anticlimatic, but i think it was appropriate.	1
	and as for the 'da vinci code', no author will ever have his protagonist find the holy grail because then you would have to describe it etc.	1
	a good read though if you like well-paced plots (and a more satisfying ending) would be debut author megan webster's novel which just came out on amazon i think about a month ago.	1
	it's called 'mightier than the sword' and i highly recommend it.       	1
	dan brown does it again..first dan brown took on the catholic church in 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code'.	1
	in this exceptional suspense-thriller he takes careful aim at the freemasons - '...not a secret society, but a society with secrets...' and weaves his story-telling skills around the symbols of the masons and architecture of washington dc.	1
	throw in a threat to national security, an ominous figure with a twisted personal history, and some authentic sounding science, with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your chair, and you have a winning formula for this page turner.recommendation: start reading it early on a day when you plan to do nothing else, as you will find yourself reading all day.      	1
	dan brown fan club.i have been a big fan of dan brown since i picked up the davinci code almost 5 years ago.	1
	i then picked up deception point, angels & demons to this ... he did not disappoint here too!	1
	i think its the part mystery, part fiction, mostly non-fiction writing.	1
	he incorporates a lot of fact into his writing & makes us all crave for the next book, to be released ...next year?      	1
	book from amazon.the book, 'the lost symbol,' was in great condition and it arrived withing a week of purchase.	1
	i was very impressed with the vendor.      	1
	my first dan brown.i have seen all of the movies.	1
	they were good.my son gave me 'the lost symbol' for christmas.i read it in two days - two working days!i am now reading the last two books in reverse order.i love them also.read all of dan brownhe is a wonderful writer.michael m      	1
	can i add something about the science in this book?.many have commented about how idiotic this book is (and i wholeheartedly agree), but i felt compelled to say something about the science in it.it's sooooo poorly done and understood that is pathetic...i should say dangerous!	1
	i'm worried about the young minds and the confusion this book could cause.	1
	please parents warn your children...      	1
	two thumbs up!.if you liked 'angels and demons' and 'the davinci code' you will enjoy 'the lost symbol'.	1
	first, to really become entrenched in a book there must be a level of believability.	1
	intertwining actual sites in washington dc makes me want to retrace the steps that occurred in the reading much like in dan brown's previous books.	1
	if you love archeological, mystery-driven, fictional writings laced with a tad of biblical flair, then read away!	1
	the book was very entertaining.	1
	i read it in 2 days!        	1
	perfect and fast.i am always amazed with finding the book or cd i want so fast and receiving it so promptly.	1
	thank you so much for both.	1
	granny from centralia      	1
	fascinating story - completely engaging.this is definitely his best so far in my opinion.	1
	the story kept me on the edge of my seat and the intensity of the mystery was intoxicating.	1
	brown's novels are slightly prescriptive, but i don't think this is necessarily bad because it works.	1
	it starts out with robert langdon getting invited to help (only this invitation is a bit more twisted and unique than the previous two stories) with something, which sends him to the location of this story: washington, d.c. it definitely had the villainous character of course.	1
	i love the twisted psychopaths that brown creates -- usually their passion lies in something that they think is larger than themselves.	1
	it had an attractive yet incredibly intelligent woman as well as langdon's sidekick.	1
	they are racing against time to save the life of someone who needs help which is somewhat similar to angels & demons.	1
	and -- they are racing to solve anxious mysteries that will save the life of someone in the present day, also quite similar to angels & demons.	1
	the real-life treasure hunt and addressing one of the most mysterious groups that ever existed: the masons, is what keeps the pages turning in this story.	1
	it also lets you in on some secrets of washington and brings you into some places of this masonic city that you never knew existed.	1
	it has crazy twists and turns and a remarkable ending that you won't expect.       	1
	a great ride.now i'll start off by saying this book isn't exactly a masterpiece along the lines of dickens, dostoevsky or hemingway but who cares?	1
	the lost symbol is a fun ride from beginning to end, with plenty of plot twists.	1
	i genuinely found this book hard to put down and i was left wanting more at the end.	1
	i didn't think it was as good as the davinci code but it was definitely better than angels and demons.	1
	if you're a fan of dan brown then give this book a shot, i think that you'll have a fun time with it.      	1
	a classic dan brown thriller.....although this book wasn't as good as his other books, it still captures your attention and is a fluent read!	1
	after this book i put washington d.c. to my 'must see' list..... i hope he will cover some secrets of asian and middle eastern world in his next book...  can't wait for the next one!      	1
	great book, mediocre ending.this was a fantastic read - i could not put the book down!	1
	i was a little disappointed with a huge build up, massive climax, and then a sudden dusty ending however.	1
	but overall, fantastic book...i definitely recommend!      	1
	a page turner.	1
	perfect for a beach holiday..i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	although the quality of his writing is average at best, he does create page-turners with a huge amount of research supporting most his novels.	1
	the lost symbol is no different, blending mysticism, science and art in a tight thriller.	1
	i have enjoyed despite extravagant twists and poor dialogues.      	1
	fast-paced and captivating read..plenty of long reviews already.	1
	once again mr brown almost makes me want to skip ahead to find out what's next, almost.       	1
	dan brown at his best.sometime i like reading just for the entertainment and i feel mr. brown does a great job.	1
	having known him since his first novel i found tls a perfect third episode of mr langdon adventures, a modern indiana jones lost for the first time in a us city: yes in this book dc is not less fascinating then paris or rome and off course you don't have to deal with the absurd exchange rate for the euro.	1
	i don't want to spoil anyone but the only real change in the script is the absence of an attractive young woman for robert to seduce with his unlimited knoweledge other than that it's pure dan brown from head to toe. 	1
	masterfully developed.read the book in a couple of days.	1
	enjoyed the story development; however, would have liked a more 'awe-ha' ending.	1
	service from amazon dependable and accurate as is the norm for purchases i've made.      	1
	loved the book!	1
	heck with the naysayers..i just loved this book.	1
	fascinating all the way through.	1
	i did not find it predictable at all.	1
	just go with the flow and you will enjoy it.	1
	and remember people, it's fiction.	1
	brown is a writer of such calibre that one can easily forget that.	1
	you get so caught up you start to think this is all real.	1
	that is part of the magic.	1
	great fun!      	1
	luke 17.bible quote 'the kingdom of god is within you' appears in verse 21, not in verse 20 as stated in the book.	1
	other than that, this is an excellent read.      	1
	another great read by dan brown!.i have read all of dan browns books and here's how i rate them in order of my favorite first.	1
	1. the lost symbol2.	1
	angels and demons3.	1
	deception point4.	1
	the da vinci code5.	1
	digital fortress i particularly enjoyed the lost symbol and could hardly put it down.	1
	same thing with angels and demons.	1
	i read his books completely as fiction and enjoy them without getting caught up in whether something is 100% accurate like some other reviewers.	1
	i read simply for the enjoyment of it.	1
	some of the twists had me gasping and i just thoroughly enjoyed it!        	1
	it seems my ignorance is a gift..people are saying this a repeat but i have never read dan brown before so i dont know what past books are like.	1
	i love thiss tory.one of the best ive ever read.	1
	it seems the dvc and a and d are better so if i read this/ which i love/ and then them it will only get better.	1
	dan brown is a fantastic writer. 	1
	a real page turner.kept u on the edge of your seat for most of the book.	1
	however it could have ended sooner      	1
	great book.i just recieved a new kindle for christmas so i wanted to buy 'the lost symbol' but after reading all the bad reviews i tried it first.	1
	i read about three chapters and was hooked.	1
	this is a really good book so don't believe all the bad reviews.	1
	i haven't finished it yet but it is well worth it.	1
	enjoy!      	1
	didnt dissapoint.i could not wait to get a hold of this book and i read it in one day didnt put it down even to eat or poop :)      	1
	brown's best novel yet!.i am surprised at the negative reviews.	1
	i thought this was his best novel to date.	1
	the plot was suspenseful and the character's believable.	1
	the ending was a true shocker.	1
	i would recommend this to anyone.       	1
	lost symbol.can't put it down!!	1
	want to go to last chapter to see the ending---but won't.	1
	wonder what dan brown's next book will be about and when will it be published?      	1
	thought-provoking and fast-moving: better than da vinci..i read much of the teachings summarized here long ago and so was delighted to find them aggregated in this thought-provoking mystery that also has interesting facts about our nation's cultural and intellectual heritage.	1
	of course religious conservatives will go nuts once again.	1
	sorry to inform them that it is a well-known fact that our founding fathers were children of the enlightenment - masons.      	1
	redundant and long winded.although the subject matter was very interesting; the book on a whole was a long winded attempt to give all of the 'facts' with very little character development.	1
	wait for the movie, this one could be  done in 60 minutes or less.       	1
	great addition!.	1
	'the lost symbol,' is a great follow up to, 'the davinci code.'	1
	i first read, 'angels and demons' and was pleased to find that brown's newest title has the same intensity and detail.	1
	again, a great read and hard to put down.      	1
	super service!.amazon is one of the few places where i know that i will find what i need at a reasonable price and the site has a reliable shipping service!	1
	i live outside us and on the market there are only few books in english that i can find and buy.	1
	but with amazon i can buy almost everything that i need or want!	1
	thank you and wish you lots of happy customers!       	1
	lost symbol 5 stars selected.once again dan brown has grasped the collective unconscious and written anothe winner.	1
	after reading this book you will surely want to visit washington dc again but, this time, with different eyes.      	1
	pretty disappointing.i am a big fan.	1
	it was good for a while then at the end it was a real let down.      	1
	awesome.this was exactly what i had expected, i am a fan of dan brown novels and i always look forward to new releases.	1
	once i saw this advertised i had no hesitations of placing and order.	1
	i received this faster than i expected allowing me the ability to begin reading.	1
	thank you sincerely.      	1
	better than davinci code.it's clear that some of us are dan brown fans and some aren't.	1
	i'm a fan and thought this was better than davinci code.	1
	(i also thought angles and demons was better than davinci.)	1
	i really enjoyed reading the lost symbol.      	1
	dan brown is the master of the code genre.a great read.	1
	i liked the story and could not put it down.	1
	i felt the same way about the atlantis code by charles brokaw.	1
	both are terrific thrillers.      	1
	the lost symbol.having been a long time student of symbolism in the arts, this book fed my mind so well.	1
	also gave me a curiosity to know more about the great public buildings and their architects.	1
	book  exceeded my expectations,  i admire the author for his research abilities and the talent to put the findings into words.	1
	thank you dan brown      	1
	another great by brown..after reading all of dan brown's books i didn't know i could still be impressed.      	1
	good, but too long.....i thoroughly enjoyed angels and demons, and the davinci code before that, but this one was not nearly as good.	1
	although many of the facts and symbols in and around our nation's capital were interesting to learn about, i thought the story dragged on way too long (500 pages for a story that takes place in one night?!).	1
	if you're a big fan of dan brown you should read it, but i doubt you'll like it as much as you liked the others....      	1
	lost symbol.i was a little disappointed when i received this book.	1
	the cover was all torn, literally in half, and there was a stamp in the book that said, 'not for resale.'	1
	i bought this book to replace a library book that was damaged and even the library wouldn't accept it.       	1
	exciting and thought provoking!.absolute thriller!!!	1
	if you liked the davinci code, then you'll love the lost symbol!	1
	don't hesitate and read it!	1
	you won't be disappointed.	1
	polemic and interesting topic, it'll keep you thinking and want to learn more about all this... i absolutely enjoyed this book and would unreservedly recommend it.	1
	enjoy!      	1
	disapointing ending.i loved the book and the detail, but at the end i got bogged down with the religious details.	1
	kind of a disapointing ending.      	1
	fabulous read.dan brown delivers again.....although the ending is somewhat predictable, the story is fast paced and entertaining right up until the very last page.	1
	i didn't want to put it down.      	1
	not as good as his last two, but worth reading.i think i would have likely this book a lot more had i not already read d-code and angels and demons.	1
	the plot was too similar but this book didn't make me stop and think like the other two did.	1
	i also think i would have enjoyed it more if my expectations had been lower.	1
	a good book, but not great.	1
	if you are a dan brown fan, you will likely enjoy it but not fall in love with it.      	1
	sigh....clever but...i just don't care about the kidnapped victim langdon has to rescue -- i mean, in times like these, why root for a pompous,old, rich, white guy?	1
	yeah, he's scholar, a philanthropist, etc., etc.	1
	but...just don't care...      	1
	really dumb book.great page turner style with weak storyline.	1
	i have read all of dan brown's books and this is the worst, by far.      	1
	extremely disappointed......i was very disappointed with this latest book by brown....it needs about 100 pages edited out....what a grueling read.      	1
	columbia, sc.i loved dan brown's latest book.	1
	because it was set in dc, i found it even better than davinci code or angels and demons.	1
	more than worth the money to buy it on the kindle!       	1
	page turner.this is the dan brown style of davinci code.	1
	i really appreciate the historical knowledge that he intertwines into a thriller.	1
	it is nice to reconnect with robert langdon once again.	1
	the ending does get a bit slow, but it is interesting and good way to close.	1
	i will read again.      	1
	good.the book arrived quickly and in brand new condition as stated, i was very happy with the service.      	1
	excellent read!.excellent read.	1
	the book i ordered came quickly, was packaged well, and was in excellent condition.      	1
	the lost symbol.bought as a gift.	1
	service was very good and received the book in less than a week      	1
	great.other great book by dan brown.	1
	the price of the hard copy was lower than all stores in town.      	1
	good read, or should i say listen?.	1
	lost symbol.dan brown makes other authors look  like amatuers .	1
	excellent !	1
	couldn't put it down .      	1
	good reading.although the author takes many liberties, it is a very active, engaging read.	1
	anxious to see if a movie is on the way.	1
	i am sure the movie will parallel the book with excellent reviews.      	1
	struggle.mr.	1
	brown's story is 509 pages long but reads like 709.  did he get paid by the page?	1
	?      	1
	book purchase.we received very good service.	1
	it was easy to order and the item came here incredibly fast.      	1
	book purchase.amazon.com is so easy to use will be back again and again.	1
	thanks very good website good job.      	1
	the lost symbol.i am still only halfway through but it is a rivetting book which keeps my interest at every page, and which as a mason i even more fascinating.	1
	thank you dan brown.      	1
	loved it!.i loved to read all of dan's brown novels.	1
	i always finish his books in a matter of days, and that to me is a good thing.      	1
	lost and found-.	1
	'lost symbol' was an amazing achievement; this book was worth reading for the ending, i was shocked, at the ingenuity of dan brown..(i won't tell the ending)yes, this book was adventurous, enlightening, and a tremendous read..thank you, dan brown for writing it..      	1
	apparently not worth reading.	1
	in a nutshell.in a nutshell: this book wasn't as good as dan brown's other novels.	1
	it was the same explanation over and over again.	1
	no suspense or interest for me.      	1
	much ado about nothing.at best, this is a formula cliffhanger.	1
	stylistically, the plot is little more than literary charlatanism.	1
	even the final 'revelations' are somewhat 'old hat.'	1
	philosophical, entertainment and educational.this book is just great, keep you always interested.	1
	it is also, as the others dan brown's books, deeply philosophical and educational, so may be is not the best novel, or the best educational book or the best philosphical book, but it has a great balance of all this subjects and for me, it is a 5 stars book.	1
	hihly recommended.	1
	book review.great book.	1
	very difficult to put it down - just want to keep reading and reading.      	1
	exciting!	1
	!.i really enjoyed reading this book!	1
	it quickly picked up the pace, and kept me very interested!	1
	very exciting throughout the novel, and kept me on the edge of my seat constantly!	1
	dozens of interesting facts!	1
	i think it'll make a good movie!	1
	definitely worth the read!      	1
	utterly shocked.just like langdon who is totally shocked and in utter disbelief every 3rd paragraph, i am suprised at how disappointing this book really is.	1
	i have enjoyed dan brown's other works, but this one fails to draw you into the story and quite frankly nothing's shocking.      	1
	lost symbol.	1
	good.	1
	brown has done it again!.i was hooked by the first few pages.	1
	brown does a great job of presenting controversial topics in a very mystery-driven manner.	1
	defiinitely highly recommended.      	1
	the worst from dan brown.	1
	waste of your money.the worst from the author.	1
	just garbage.	1
	i rather watch home shopping network than waste time on this book.	1
	i had very big expectation but what a disappointment!      	1
	overall a flat read.i'm not going to add more to what was already said in these reviews except that this was the 1st dan brown book i read and was completely disappointed by the ending.	1
	the build up (which was only ok), culminated in such a disappointment...  i guess i expected more from the author of other great stories.      	1
	robert langdon has become stupid....i'm sorry, but the giant stone which the word was buried under?	1
	i knew the ending within the first 100 or so pages.	1
	so much for unpredictable.	1
	and the classified material?	1
	why didn't she just show everyone in the first place?	1
	wouldn't that make more sense if she is trying to have them help her and gain trust?	1
	hugely disappointed, its a good thing i got it from the library and didn't pay for it.       	1
	masonic mush.unless you feel that you can't live without reading about 'secret' masonic lore, there are hundreds, even thousands of more entertaining books that you could be reading.	1
	how about a nice lustbader or a juicy ludlow?	1
	yechhh....      	1
	disappointing, way long, fake close..brown has now written 5 books, only one a success dvc; the rest i would catagorize as pulp bad amateur writing and not worthy of any fiction---historical of otherwise.	1
	in short,400 pages were a re-write so not to name it solomon's key, and the next 130 the fake wrap.	1
	wasted money.      	1
	pointless drivel ....an absolute waste of time.	1
	i really liked the da vinci code and angels and demons, but this book was about a 100 pages too long, with weak writing, and sub-standard story.       	1
	don't waste your time.this is a 100 page story condensed to 500 pages.	1
	everyone is willing to do whatever it takes to find a secret that no one knows.	1
	there is a puzzle that reveals nothing and a great truth that reveals nothing.	1
	there is science that bears no resemblance to real science that spouts drivel as facts.	1
	this was my first dan brown novel and unless i have a lobotomy, it was my last.      	1
	what an awful book.what an awful, predictable, stupid book.	1
	while,some authors, like wine, grow better with age, dan brown withers on the vine.	1
	this is just a regurgitation of the davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	same old formulaic tripe.	1
	dan brown should take a page from the movie 'inglorious basterds' and take a risk.	1
	each of these books has a great build up and then its sinks into disappointment.	1
	i also can't stand his preachiness on what he believes god is.	1
	please spare me.        	1
	the lost symbol.it was such a long wait for this book, but i felt the wait was worth every minute.	1
	i listened to it as an audio book - and i simply had a hard time getting out of my car - and i took more drives than normal!	1
	i truly enjoyed the book - and in true dan brown style - this book was finely detailed and researched, and is unique in its style.        	1
	lost  symbol.excellent book takes place all in 24hrs.	1
	exciting and a nice picture of the mason's for a change  highly recommend it      	1
	very entertaining.yes, we know dan brown is good and can entertain his audiences.	1
	this book is just as entertaining...remember it is fiction!!!	1
	if you liked the first books of this series, you will like this one too.	1
	the writing style is interesting, but he probably got many critics to speak about it.	1
	if you are looking for a book regardless of his past books, to entertain you, this is a good book for you.  	1
	it was ok but could of been better.i've read all the books written by dan brown.	1
	after the davinci code, i couldn't wait for his next book.	1
	it finally arrived and i was a bit disapointed.	1
	it just seemed to me that he wanted to write a big book and made up a bunch of useless chapters.	1
	don't get me wrong, i did enjoy the book but it did seen to drag a bit.	1
	the characters were well written and the mysteries in the book were well thought of.	1
	it was just missing that 'i need to keep reading to find out what happens' aspect that the davinci code had.      	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown.a good book, but not as good as his previous two books.....still a great read.	1
	w.b.	1
	goetz, lemoyne, pa 17043      	1
	interesting .	1
	.	1
	..i must admit that i am a dan brown fan.	1
	i loved the davinci code and angles and demons.	1
	yet, this book will not receive the praise from me that the two of those did.	1
	it was interesting and had me on the edge of my seat more than a few times.	1
	it was a good read but i felt like it lasted a lot longer than necessary.        	1
	it's alright..i felt there were many unecessary chapters in this book.	1
	toooooo much detail!	1
	way too long.      	1
	chesterfrodocat.came in good time, was purchased as a gift and we can't wait to read it       	1
	dan brown does it again....the lost symbol is a highly suspenseful, fast paced thriller done in a style only dan brown could accomplish.	1
	dan brown is a master of mixing fiction with fact teaching you trivial things about everyday objects and symbols.	1
	while you know it is a work of fiction, it is very evident which pieces are fact, but they are interwoven so well that it creates a perfectly flowing story.	1
	i would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of dan brown, or thrillers.	1
	this book is difficult to put down.      	1
	enjoyable romp through big ideas.great read that stretches the mind and the imagination.	1
	from our founding fathers to the free masons to the noetic sciences - perhaps the world contains more mysteries for us to uncover. 	1
	worth the long but engaging read for the final message.i loved this book even more than 'the davinci code' simply because of the inspiring message at the end.        	1
	disappointing but stll interesting.as always, meticulously researched and loaded with fascinating historical facts and theories regarding their significance.	1
	but dwells too long on the author's social message to the detriment of the story.      	1
	another well-crafted thriller.dan brown knows how to take characters and put them into a desparate situation so the reader has to keep turning the pages.	1
	i completed the lost symbol last night and found it a satisfying reading experience.	1
	it was not the best piece of fiction that i've read this year but it was certainly worth reading.      	1
	i read it in two days!.the lost symbol was a great read.	1
	there were many twists and turns along the way.	1
	it is the kind of book to be given to you adventurous friends, or someone who is bored with life!      	1
	dan brown delivers again!.the first 30 pages or so were off-putting, it took a few pages to get connected, but after those initial pages, it became a very compelling read so don't give up on it.	1
	as usual, dan brown delivers descriptive characters and places (i love that it is set in dc) and of course, lots of suspense.	1
	he sometimes pushes the envelope on weirdness, but he makes up for it in page-turning intrigue.      	1
	another dan brown success!.dan brown's mystery recipe once again succeeded in capturing me from page 1 making the lost symbol as intriguing and fun to read as angels & demons, and the davinci code.  	1
	mystery and intrigue.great book - after a slow start it gets a full head of steam recommended      	1
	typical dan brown.that is, typically a great and exciting read.	1
	brown has you in his hands from the first chapter and keeps you there.the only problem i had was getting tom hanks out of my head; it took almost a third of the book.	1
	danny      	1
	lost symbol in bold print.i love the bold print, it is not overly huge, but pleasant to read.	1
	shipping was slower than usual due to the weight, but the seller was very nice to keep me advised of the progress.	1
	i was pleased.      	1
	terrific read.i would reccommend this book to anyone who loved dan browns other books.	1
	it is written terrifically and shouldnt be considered as controversial as the other reviews make it seem.	1
	this book doesnt denounce faith in anyway.       	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown.anything and everything you might want to know about the masonic lodge.	1
	fast-paced thriller but i took my time to get all the historical facts and nuances.      	1
	nearly as good.	1
	the lost symbol.	1
	you can count on brown.dan brown comes through again with a fast moving intellectually fascinating tale of the world of the masons.	1
	great action,superior characters and an all around excellent story.      	1
	open your mind.without ruining any small detail , all i will say is that the book was 'well worth the wait!'	1
	though, i never understood that saying, as i would much rather not have waited!	1
	again, brown makes reading fun, stimulates the imagination and challenges the intellect.	1
	the lost symbol is every bit as good as any of his previous novels.	1
	i have only one question for mr. brown, 'when is the next book coming out?'	1
	enjoy!	1
	!       	1
	great book!.this is the second dan brown book i have read and i am hooked.	1
	his story telling is like know one else i ever read.	1
	a must read!      	1
	great sequal!.after i read the davinci code, i fell in love with all of dan brown's work and i read every book that he has ever written.	1
	this is the perfect sequal to his other two davinci code type books.	1
	it was too long coming and i hope that he is busy writing another book to keep us enjoying his fantastic work!      	1
	fast read.i definately liked this book better than either da vinci code and angles and demons.	1
	it gave great believable thriller material to read fast and hard.	1
	i liked all the references about masons and our founding fathers.	1
	i can't wait for the movie.	1
	he does have a propencity to go on and on at the end though.	1
	hollywood will fix all that in the movie.      	1
	i liked it..i think that this was a good follow up to dan brown's last novel and i really enjoyed it.	1
	it was fast paced and the story was really good.	1
	sure there was some filler, but that's the kind of book this is.	1
	it's an entertaining story and i think it was quite good.       	1
	the lost symbol.i ordered the lost symbol from amazon and received it almost overnight.	1
	it was another dan brown page-turner.	1
	i read it over a weekend.	1
	althogh it stood on its own, having read the davinci code was good background for this book.      	1
	the lost symbol - audio.	1
	the lost symbol-review.another great piece of work by dan brown.	1
	drawing robert langdon to the aid of one of his greatest friends starts a chain of events that is beyond langdon himself.	1
	brown delves deep into the archaic symbolism within washington dc and uncovers more mysteries with every page.      	1
	lost symbol indeed.	1
	finally!.it seems like forever since dan brown published anything, but this was definitely worth the wait.	1
	fast-paced and full of obscure facts.	1
	brown is a master at mixing just enough truth into his fiction to keep readers fascinated.      	1
	dan brown  the lost symbol.i love this book.	1
	dan brown is one of the best thriller writers of our time.i can't put it down.	1
	keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.recommended for everyone who likes mystery and intrigue.      	1
	dan brown's lost symbol.	1
	great read.this really is a great book.	1
	in my personal opinion, the 'theology' is whacked, but i'm strong enough in my beliefs that i don't let it sway me.	1
	once you get beyond that, it is a great read.	1
	i couldn't put it down.      	1
	dan brown gives us another page turner.	1
	he doesn't disappoint..living in washington, dc, i was even more enthralled than usual by dan brown's new release.	1
	i loved it, loved it, loved it.	1
	it keeps you on the edge of your seat and provides the historical framework as well as the plot twists and turns that we've come to expect.      	1
	his best yet.i challenge all believers to read this latest tome and learn the mysteries of our country's past through the lives of the powerful few who tapped into the greatest power.	1
	if you open your mind and soul you, too, may understand the power and its truth.      	1
	great entertainment!.i have read all of dan brown's books and really enjoyed them.	1
	i just finished the lost symbol and sat on the edge of my seat for most of the book.for anyone wanting to be entertained and be left with the 'what if' thought, i highly recommend it.       	1
	outstanding reading.i mailed this book to my son, he enjoyed it so much that he brought it to texas for a visit and 3 other people read it.	1
	stated it was one of the best books he has read.      	1
	dan brown - once again a terrific book!	1
	!.although quite similar in writing stye/theme to the da vinci code this book is excellent.	1
	the factual elements that are intermixed with mystery elements of the story are very interesting.	1
	so interesting that i found myself 'google-ing' them at different points in the story just to prove to myself that they were real.	1
	they were!	1
	this is a 'page turner' that keeps you glued to the book, always anxious to see where all the 'twists and turns' are going to lead you!	1
	an excellent book through out, and very enjoyable reading!      	1
	if you like dan brown.if you like dan brown's books, this one will not dissappoint.	1
	in his usual style, he takes you on a ride through washington dc that keeps you guessing.	1
	i loved all of the interesting factiods he teaches us about the history of dc and its many facinating buildings.        	1
	this book should be required reading in school..dan brown has crafted a gripping story that connects the ancient mysteries, science and religion.	1
	this is a history book that should be required reading in school.	1
	les schmidtauthor/coach/consultant[...]      	1
	lost symboll.good, very good.	1
	as good as the other robert langford books.	1
	full of suspense, history, & lore.        	1
	great book.this is a great book, and glad to see amazon had it for sale on the opening day!      	1
	good book.great book in terms of relaying history, dan brown is an expert at this.	1
	however, given his previous offerings the plot was kinda expected.	1
	still a great book      	1
	couldn't put it down.once i started the book, couldn't stop reading.	1
	i read it in 2 days.	1
	dan brown has held my attention with all his novels.	1
	when i read, i am in the story with the characters, hearing what they say, feling what they feel.	1
	and dan brown has done this with his novels.	1
	i look forward  to more by him.      	1
	good book.i started reading this on my kindle the day it came out.	1
	unlike angels & demons i did not find myself thinking about giving up on the book.	1
	it was an entertaining and easy read.	1
	i think people might have set expectations too high for this one.	1
	some things felt a little choppy, and a little repetitive, but all in all a solid read.      	1
	fantastic journey +disappointing (& preachy) ending.friends: if you love dan brown as much as i do, of course you want to read this book and it is a great story and a 'great ride' so to speak.	1
	but when it all comes to an end, if you are like me, you will say to yourself: 'what?	1
	that is what all this was about!'	1
	what a disappointing and very preachy ending.	1
	dan: if you are listening?	1
	what the hell is wrong with you?      	1
	the lost symbol.a great story, especially for someone who knows washington dc.	1
	however, i don't think it's as good as his first two books.	1
	in particular it went on too far - drawn out - as though the author was padding.	1
	but, i liked it.      	1
	fine.this was a fine read.	1
	it is a heavy burden for the author of dc to overcome expectations.      	1
	another page-turner!.particularly interesting as i live in dc.	1
	i'm certain there will be tours of the city and points referenced in the book.      	1
	it's dan bown.it's dan brown.it's fun.it's  predictable.still worth the read if you like dan brown.      	1
	not stellar, but entertaining and at times interesting.there is something immensely entertaining about conspiracy theories.	1
	to come up with an utterly ludicrous premise, and use real facts, documents, and artefacts to support it so well that the reader can suspend disbelief for a few hours is a challenging task, and it's something dan brown is really good at.	1
	in his previous books, dan brown made his task a little easier by choosing cities that are thousands of years old for his locations.	1
	cities like paris and rome have a rich history, and a lot of that history is veiled in myths, which gave brown a lot of room to manoeuvre in.	1
	for his new book, brown set a much tougher challenge for himself by choosing a relatively young city (washington dc) as a location.	1
	brown did surprisingly well with his new backdrop.	1
	he found plenty of clues for his story, and the book is a treasure of historical and cultural trivia.	1
	this aspect of the book i found immensely entertaining.	1
	but washington dc is also the main weakness of the book: there is no way brown could construct a gripping conclusion for the story that could match the da vinci code, and as a result the lost symbol ends with a total anticlimax.	1
	not only that, actions that seemed plausible throughout the book suddenly become inexplicable in the light of the conclusion.	1
	this book deserved a better ending.	1
	dan brown's books are so formulaic that it is starting to affect their quality.	1
	more than once brown had to cheat a little to conceal his tricks because they are getting too predictable.	1
	imagination is not brown's forte, and he should think about teaming up with a more creative mind for future books.	1
	the characters: now that robert langdon, the main character of several novels, is closer to home, we get to meet some of his friends.	1
	it gives langdon a little more personal involvement in the story, but anyone looking for emotional depth is advised to look elsewhere.	1
	brown put most of his energy developing the villain, and this is where brown trumped his previous creations.	1
	this person is scarier than silas or the hassassin, and brown gives him plenty of opportunity to show his skills.	1
	brown talks a lot about religion and science in this book, and i wish he hadn't.	1
	this prose can only be described as wishful thinking, and bears very little relationship with real science.	1
	a huge opportunity was missed here.	1
	washington dc is a great place for anyone interested in real science, but this is very poorly represented in this book.	1
	brown's literary style has been severely criticised by the more pedantic among his readership.	1
	frankly, i don't care.	1
	like his other books, this book is written well enough to keep you going, and that's all you really should expect from a fast-paced book like this.	1
	overall, if you're interested in an adventure with a rich context and lots of tidbits of historical and cultural information, this book is well worth the read.	1
	lost symbol read.	1
	great book - weak ending....i thought this book moved fast like the others by brown.	1
	felt like i couldn't put it down but the ending was weak...      	1
	excellent.book received in excellent condition just as promised - on the day it got released      	1
	fun read, not as good as angels & demons.well researched and quite entertaining.	1
	not as good as angles & demons, but well worth the money.       	1
	lost symbol.	1
	dan brown's best work yet!.	1
	the lost symbol.i can't believe the one star reviews, but i understand that it may not be 5 stars.	1
	is dan brown a formulaic writer?	1
	yes, without a doubt.	1
	is the formula good?	1
	i think so.	1
	you don't sell that many books if they are no good.	1
	the bottom line for me is that is may not be a classic with staying power and i am not inclined to read it again, but while i was reading it i didn't want to put it down.	1
	it is a thriller novel, and for what it is i think it is great.       	1
	careful - no text-to-speech..careful - if you're looking for text-to-speech do not buy the kindle edition.	1
	so much for amazon's big sales pitch regarding kindle's text-to-speech functionality.	1
	it is bunk!	1
	if you are considering a kindle for text-to-speech, think again...      	1
	not disappointed!.i have to admit that going in to this book i was anticipating a letdown given the success of the davinci code and the amount of time that it took for dan brown to come out with a follow-up.	1
	however, i was far from disappointed.	1
	this book was even better than the davinci code and was tough to put down.	1
	there were unexpected twists and enough historical reference to keep things intriguing.	1
	if you liked or loved the davinci code, you will love this book.	1
	if you weren't a fan then i would pass as it is similar in style to that book.	1
	i hope it doesn't take as long for another dan brown book.      	1
	the search for the word.the book as most of dan brown's was fun to read and as the story progressed was increasingly hard to put down.	1
	as a mason myself, it was extremely interesting, and thought provoking.	1
	the characters were strong and the story telling made reading fun.	1
	i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hint of conspiracy theory, the thrill of the di vinci code, and surprises through out the novel.	1
	go for it but remember it is still fiction      	1
	classic dan brown.another great book from dan brown.	1
	if you enjoyed any of his previous novels you'll love this one.	1
	thrilling story and a fascinating level of detail, can't wait to go up to washington d.c. after reading the book!      	1
	jcoompletely enjoyable.dan brown's three 'robert langdon' books take readers on a tour of interesting places, provide historical and non-historical information about long-standing myths, legends, and rumors (and some realities), and along the way, entertain with spectacular twists and turns.	1
	i was completely entertained by 'the lost symbol.'	1
	the langdon character could be considered the personification of [...] -- a myth-buster of the nth degree.	1
	the character's reiteration of skepticism seems to be the author's way of reminding readers that this is, after all, a work of fiction -- laced with facts, to be sure -- but still a work of fiction.	1
	(and who among us doesn't 'see' tom hanks as we picture the events in our minds?)	1
	come along for the ride!	1
	the villain is well realized; the all-too-human heros and heroines are mostly beliveable, and the description of ascending to high, precarious places will have anyone suffering from vertigo experiencing a twinge of tummy flutters (ditto those who are claustrophobic when characters descend to the bowels of the capitol building).	1
	as a plus, the descriptions of various buildings and sites in washington, d.c., will make fine additions to one's must-see list when next visiting our nation's capitol.	1
	this leads to the question: what next for langdon, this modern-day intellectual indiana jones?   	1
	no secrets here.well, it's nice that dan's books are bringing eternal views to light that i have already known.my religion has taught from day one the female divine concept and that.. as man is, god once was and as god is, man may become...oh well, maybe his next book will have something i didn't already know.      	1
	recommended for real fans of brown's work only.similarly to michael crichton fans, there are some of us that like thrillers with a smart plot buit on well research subject, so we do not expect a work of literature in this type of novel.	1
	brown accomplishes that, so if you enjoy  and , definitively this is a book you want to read, you will be entertained for most of the 500 pages.	1
	however, despite of being a brown fan, i rated the book just with three stars due to the following shortcomings.	1
	leaving literary critic aside, i felt that some of the explanations went into unnecessary and sometimes boring detail, and here, brown is beginning to look like crichton's latest novels, already presenting in the book the draft script for a movie.	1
	also, the ending is unnecessary extended, the after talks and final reflections are not that interesting, and actually some of the info could have been included before the real end of the story.	1
	as opposed to the da vinci code, some of the potential and surprising facts and discoveries were undoubtedly spoiled by the film , though brown goes into much more detail and fully explores the influence of freemasonry among several of the key american founding fathers, and also did not miss the opportunity to bust plenty of myths surrounding this fraternity.	1
	another dj vu feeling originates from the evolution of the mal'akh character, who as the story advances looks too much to the tooth fairy character in the film .	1
	there is plenty of mysticism and even new age discourse, too much for my taste, but for those who enjoy there are even a couple of mentions to the 2012 mayan prediction. 	1
	da vinci code goes to washington!.good fast paced read.	1
	da vinci code goes to washington.	1
	history is fun.	1
	try it you will like it.      	1
	terrific suspense!.	1
	how good is 'the lost symbol'?	1
	good enough to keep me up till 5 a.m. reading until i couldn't focus my eyes anymore.	1
	yes, dan brown is largely following the formula he established in 'the da vinci code'.	1
	so what?	1
	in terms of producing suspense and keeping the reader turning pages, the formula works.	1
	we have the villain, mal `akh, truly the incarnation of evil.	1
	wealthy, superbly intelligent, strong beyond ordinary mortals, cunning, sadistic and filled with hate.	1
	he is a student of the black arts and aspires to acquiring the secrets of the ancients by any means possible.	1
	by now, it is no secret, ancient or otherwise, that it is the masons who possess the key to the knowledge of the ancients and, lo and behold, that key, if not the secrets themselves, are located in the washington dc area.	1
	robert langdon, the hero of 'the da vinci code' receives a call from the assistant to his old friend, peter solomon, the chair of the smithsonian, asking him to fill in on short notice for a speaker scheduled to appear at the nation's capitol that evening.	1
	langdon, ever the gentleman, agrees to fill in.	1
	langdon arrives at the capitol and the 'fun' begins.	1
	now, one has to be careful, particularly with suspense this finely wrought not to drop 'spoilers' and ruin someone else's pleasure.	1
	langdon quickly finds himself plunged into crisis.	1
	there is no speech to be given.	1
	instead there is a severed hand in the capitol rotunda, a capitol police official and a senior cia administrator.	1
	langdon is at that the center when he recognizes the hand as belonging to peter solomon.	1
	the cia administrator, inoue sato, is a well drawn character.	1
	of japanese ancestry, she is hard as nails and, putting it mildly, a survivor.	1
	friend or foe?	1
	neither langdon nor the reader know at this point.	1
	within a few pages, two more main characters are introduced, the capitol architect and katherine solomon, sister to peter.	1
	now, one by one, author dan brown spins out the history of the masons, their reputed secrets and an amazing outpouring of us history.	1
	browns assures us that all of the organizations and locales he cites are genuine.	1
	brown deftly leads the reader on a tour of washington dc that few, if any, of us will ever take through secret rooms and tunnels, to locations laden with history, always with the evil mal'akh and the cia on our trail.	1
	there are lots of close calls, heart-thumping narrow escapes, no shortage of impending doom and a few difficult-to-believe, but adrenalin producing, scenarios.	1
	brown uses an old fiction device: short chapters with a cliff-hanger at the end of each.	1
	it may be old, but it works.	1
	all of brown's characters are richly detailed.	1
	langdon, as he did in 'the da vinci code', gnaws at the edge of credibility, with his immense knowledge, but what the heck - he is the hero.	1
	brown employs a clever strategy with langdon having all the pieces, but reaching the incorrect conclusion the first time around.	1
	overall, this is just plain good suspense wrapped inside a great thriller.	1
	yes, the formula is within spitting distance of 'the da vinci code', but so what?	1
	it's good suspense and a very good read.	1
	jerry	1
	a boring ad for freemasonry.as dennis leary said about 'titanic': 'yeah, yeah, ok, it's a boat.'	1
	this is not a good book.	1
	it it uninspired and poorly written.	1
	the man has no rhythm in his writing.	1
	da vinci was a good page turner.	1
	i've read the others too and liked angels & demons.	1
	but this?	1
	it's like crichton's last novels.	1
	he just keeps repeating a formula.	1
	most of this book is a lecture on symbology and an ad for the many virtues of the freemasons.	1
	he constantly loses the plot and goes back in time or lets his characters discuss 'ancient mysteries' in the most unrealistic situations.	1
	at times this is downright silly.	1
	i don't think mr. brown wanted to be funny and/or cheap but he managed both.	1
	and the finale is ridiculous.	1
	sad.      	1
	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.way too boring.	1
	just when you think things are about to take off you have a crash landing of disappointment.	1
	dan brown knew that he could pile a bunch of gunk into this one and that it would still fly of off the shelves, but he shot himself in the foot for future releases.      	1
	amazing read.	1
	the lost symbol jumped off the pages.	1
	chapters 103, 107 and 133 sealed it for me making this dan brown's best work to date.	1
	51.4534644 kg      	1
	the grades are in.so here's the deal: plotting (a), characters (c), setting (c), plausibility (d), description (c+), set pieces (a), theme (c).	1
	the lost symbol is conventional dan brown--a mystery to be solved by robert langdon, in the company of a woman, while he conjures with a bad guy and is being chased by a government agency.	1
	the mystery involves symbology, numerology, the doings of a secret society and first and last things (i.e.	1
	faith, religion, the nature of reality, the cosmos, etc.).	1
	comparisons with angels and demons and the davinci code are inevitable, because brown has created a franchise designed to produce a reliable product.	1
	this installment--the lost symbol--concerns freemasonry in washington, d.c.  a mentor of langdon's has been taken against his will.	1
	langdon partners with the mentor's sister to satisfy the demands of the mentor's captor and simultaneously reconstruct a pyramid, find a place and determine the key to wisdom that will facilitate the apotheosis of mankind.	1
	the bad guy's name is moloch (we [and milton] would spell it that way); he's covered in tattoos, takes steroids, has castrated himself and likes to look at himself in the mirror nude as well as kill members of langdon's mentor's family.	1
	the cia director hot on langdon's trail is short, female, and japanese.	1
	a heavy smoker, she has yellowed teeth and a moustache.	1
	the mentor, peter solomon, is a 33rd degree mason/billionaire; his sister has a lab in which she is doing `noetic science', studying the ways in which mind affects matter.	1
	no one has ever told brown that less can sometimes be more.	1
	in the course of langdon's race against time we get a tour of washington, a city whose details langdon knows much better than brown, whose designation of neighborhoods and time/distance travel estimates will be seen as flawed by local residents.	1
	the compensation for this shortcoming may be the set pieces in which brown plays out the details of numerology, myth and symbology.	1
	these are sometimes very impressive and very clever.	1
	the major problem with the book, in my opinion, is the theme.	1
	it lacks the specificity of the davinci code, a book with a theme that has been the subject of scholarship, a subject that concerns an essential issue in catholicism, a subject that is controversial and engaging.	1
	the subject of the lost symbol is much more diffuse.	1
	for many it will be much less engaging.	1
	most (or at least many) will quickly figure out the site which langdon is laboring to find and most will be disappointed by what he finds there, not because it is unimportant but because it is sufficiently `common' that one wonders why all the masons in the book are trying to protect it at great personal cost.	1
	in short, the climax is anticlimactic in the extreme and it is followed by page after page of discourse which many readers will find preachy.	1
	having said all that, the book will still hold most readers' attention; with the amazon discount they will not feel that they have wasted their money and they will look forward to dan brown's next book.      	1
	a solid follow up.i agree with many of the previous reviewers...there are aspects of this book that i had a hard time getting past.	1
	the running back and forth conversation with the stereotypical cia hard-nosed deputy director got very old, very fast.	1
	at times, it felt like the start of the book was in fact a rehash of national treasure...but with robert langdon playing the role of ben gates (nicholas cage).	1
	the first quarter of the book was relatively slow...but set the stage for an explosive run for the finish.	1
	unlike the da vinci code, i could not get into the excitement of running around washington, d.c.  granted, there are lots of great and interesting tid-bits to take away about our nation's capital.	1
	however, there is something to be said about escaping (in a book) to france than to d.c.  the long time spent under the capitol started to tax my commitment to the book, and langdon left there just in time to maintain my interest.	1
	just as i'm sure the air is stale, this portion of the book started to pick up the same scent.	1
	once langdon got out from the capitol, however, the book really starts to pick up steam.	1
	the plot lines suddenly started to make sense and weave together.	1
	each character's past begins to intertwine with one another and the curtain is raised on an exciting novel...classic dan brown.	1
	suddenly it felt like i was back in a dan brown book...rapid pace, exciting story, a mix of history/historical novel and money well spent.	1
	i was happy to see brown still had that magic which made angels and demon and the da vinci code two of my favorite novels.	1
	while its hard to compare this book to the da vinci code, the elements of brown's storytelling, fast pace and the character of robert langdon all made it worth while.	1
	do not worry if you find yourself slowing down at the start of the book...it will take off like a rocket.	1
	all i can say, in true dan brown fashion, is hang on for the ride!	1
	on a side note, i read this book on my amazon kindle (generation 1...old school!).	1
	turned it on the morning of the 15th and was excited to see the new book download right onto my kindle.	1
	amazon, i'm hooked on my kindle!         	1
	great but somewhat flawed.look this is a great story with lots of twists and i enjoyed it.	1
	although the setup was very similiar it is a must read      	1
	six years for this?.how does it take dan brown six years to cut and-paste the lost symbol from his earlier books?	1
	how does janet maslin of the new york times gush over this claptrap?	1
	the reviewers below got it right:  the atlantis prophecy by thomas greanias runs circles, pentagrams and every other symbol around brown's warmed-over hash.	1
	the lost symbol deeply disappoints this fan.      	1
	why all the 1-star reviews?.dan brown's third robert langdon book is predictable, in a literary writing sense.	1
	the plot, as in most dan brown's novels, is twist-turning and shocking.	1
	the story is well-paced and characters are well portrayed, even though most of them are dan brown's cliche.	1
	this novel captivated my interest from the first page to the final revelation.	1
	after finishing this novel, i looked on amazon to see how reviewers rated this book.	1
	i was definitely confused when i saw all the 1 and 2 star reviews.	1
	i question the validity of these absurb and unconstructive reviews.	1
	must of these 1-star review claimed that they are avid dan brown readers (such as 'i read all of dan brown's books...' or 'believe me, i am a dan brown fan...') and naturally, i would assume that they are familiar with dan brown's literary style.	1
	most of these so-called fans criticized dan brown's writing style and how it was 'boring' and 'unnecessarily detailed secondary characters'.	1
	i admit that dan brown borrowed his formulated writing style from his earlier novels, so i can understand how some would deem it 'repetitve and boring'.	1
	but wouldn't the so-called fans expect this style of writing from the beginning anyway?	1
	and overly detailed secondary characters is a problem now?	1
	i would think that readers would want to care about the characters rather than not caring what would happen to the characters (for example, in the lost symobl, i actually cared about trish even though she contributed little to the ongoing plot).	1
	i even read some reviews saying that this book has no controversy (opposed to the da vinci code and angels and demons)... well, they obviously haven't finished reading the novel.	1
	in my opinion, this book is even more controversial than his earlier novels (i am not going to spill the bean here).	1
	i find the last symobl a highly enjoyable read, and it really makes you think about your view on life and the mysterious world.	1
	again, this book might go aganist some's religious beliefs, but it shouldn't stop you from reading a good fiction book.        	1
	well jeez, i really liked it.i'm surprised at all of the critical reviews of this book.	1
	i guess i shouldn't be too surprised - people always set insurmountable expectations for events like this one.	1
	they are bound to be disappointed.	1
	i, for one, consider any book that i can't put down to be a successful venture in this age of 24/7 stimuli.	1
	i not only enjoyed this book, i would (dare i say!)	1
	read it again one of these days.	1
	brown weaves a convincing story that, just as in davinci, urges readers take a second look at the world around them.	1
	the book is well researched and chock full of puzzles, rituals, symbols and science.	1
	this unique combination is brown's hallmark, and no other author i've read has been able to come close to perfecting the formula.	1
	lost symbol isn't going to win any literary competitions.	1
	it was not written to move the english language to a new frontier, folks.	1
	it was written to entertain, and for me at least, it did exactly that.       	1
	did the job.hard to follow up with a book so hyped and controversial like the da vinci code.	1
	many unfair reviews from people that haven't even read the book and just hate dan brown for what he writes.	1
	whatever.	1
	this book was well written and entertaining.	1
	did what it was supposed to do.	1
	carry you away from reality for a while without being bored and annoyed.	1
	and some nice history lessons in there as well, as in all of his books.	1
	if you can't enjoy it, it's your own fault.      	1
	wow* would be armchair author-critics hate a success..wow.	1
	all the negative reviews.	1
	for a book that i only put down when my eyes were so tired, i couldn't keep them open.	1
	i say this is my favorite page turner with a great finish.	1
	i told my wife to wait buying it for me, but i am glad she suprised me.	1
	now only if they would cast ralph fiennes as robert langdon.	1
	tom hanks?	1
	no offense, but he is not the right guy.	1
	when i read these reviews, it sounds like an army of contentious unheard authors & critics.	1
	people envy success in all the wrong ways.      	1
	wit and wisom from dan brown.at the risk of sounding too enthusiastic, i'm going to be completely frank here.	1
	this is the smartest, wisest novel so far published in the 21st century.	1
	it's a super page-turner, too, but that tends to get lost in the wit and wisdom dan brown offers to an entertainment consuming public sorely in need of tales with substance.	1
	no doubt the novel will irk those with established interests to protect, but hopefully it will also inspire thought and discussions about the bigger picture humanity is part of.	1
	if you have ever thought about truth, religion, or the direction mankind is taking, read this book - you'll enjoy it!       	1
	very informative and easy to follow.the book was very good.	1
	it kept my interest to the point where i found myself reading through the late hours of morning.	1
	i am impressed with the length of his book along with the associations he made in regards to noetic science and modern civilization.	1
	this subject alone being covered will pave a new idea and road for such which is a very plausible approach to leading human intelligence towards enlightenment and hope where it wasn't noticed before.	1
	the immense research dan brown has done that shows in his book is simply astounding!	1
	never have i read a novel so full of very real studies and research.	1
	the only downside to the book is i guessed where the ancient word was hidden when 'as above, so below' was mentioned the first time in the book.	1
	other than that, this book is amazing and is definitely worth reading.	1
	i even found myself looking up the information in his book, making for much more educational interest.	1
	this book, other than being a fantastic read, is also a eye opener for those willing to question their beliefs and perceptions.	1
	those that are not capable of doing so will be noticed in the ridiculously picky and merciless reviews as it mirrors such and emotional response.	1
	but then again that's what was so good about davinci code.	1
	other than digital fortress this is his best piece yet in my humble opinion.	1
	read it!      	1
	not great but definetely worth it.i think after reading the book we can conclude that dan brown will not come out of his sucessful theme .	1
	it has same theme as his other two sucessful books ..but must agree have a different twist .	1
	his combining of both noetic sceiences and masons ancient mystery  is similar to what he tried to do in angels and demons .	1
	but the ending was very good ..instead of showing a treasure a.k.a national treasure movie the ending has some meaning which all the people can grasp .	1
	overall loved the book not at all disappointed unlike many ... looking forward to the movie !!	1
	!      	1
	a good read.i like dan brown books.	1
	unlike  most readers, davinci code was not my favorite.	1
	this book was good- at times there was a little too much detail.	1
	i agree with others that about 100 pages could have been cut out.	1
	but, it's a good book and better than about 90% of everything else in the library.	1
	i was able to guess all the surprises, which i've never done in his books before....but that was okay.	1
	it's a good book.	1
	don't buy it new unless that's your thing.	1
	buy a used copy, or get it from the library and don't go thinking it's going to be bigger, better and amazing.	1
	just looking for a good book?	1
	okay, you found one.      	1
	it's a great read with a fantastic twist... different but great..if you are a curious person, a science junkie or just knowledgably of washington d.c. you'll love this book.	1
	if you are a dan brown fan then you'll really enjoy this book.	1
	if you are not a reader in general then you'll probably.... maybe dislike it.       	1
	another page turner by dan brown.i absolutely loved this book.	1
	i didn't want to put it down.	1
	the message brown was trying to portray really buoyed my spirit as well as he got me to exclaim out loud while reading some of the ending.	1
	i would highly recommend this book, i learned some things as a bonus but overall thoroughly enjoyed reading it.      	1
	excellent book!.i loved this book!	1
	i was obsessed w/reading and finishing it.	1
	lots of twists.	1
	i think dan brown is an excellent author.	1
	i had read all his books and thoroughly enjoyed each one.	1
	i highly recommend the lost symbol.	1
	i do wonder how the author comes up with this stuff....this book is bizarre!!	1
	!      	1
	riveting story.having finished this book on my way to dc, i couldn't wait to explore some of the sites mentioned in the book.	1
	the scottish rite 'temple' was amazing to see in a mostly residential area.	1
	although i will admit that i found the 'bad' character a replica of the one in davinci code, and at times felt that dan brown was writing a movie instead of a book, i wanted to reread sections upon completion and i found the final 'word' very inspiring.	1
	i highly recommend!      	1
	best of dan brown.i bought it, started reading it, and couldn't put it down until 4:30 this morning.	1
	for my 8:00am english literature class, i went into non-stop praise mode.	1
	this is the best of all dan's novels so far.	1
	it is in high epistemology mode all the way through and his character langdon is the perfect foil for the novelist to teach people what words actually mean, what actions happen when a reaction is triggered (and not vice versa), and what some organizations are really all about.	1
	if my father, a 33degree mason were alive to read this, he would not be happy because just a few too many things are revealed that are best left 'unrevealed' about the lodge.	1
	but overall, a fast paced, thinking person's novel...and dan has made a whole new set of fans with this novel, and a whole new set of enemies since the cia and the nsa are not fans of authors who release codes, code breaking, and reveal organizations within secret organizations.	1
	for all of dan's critics out there, try to remember, this is a novel meant to not only entertain (the movie will be unreal!	1
	), but to give knowledge a full-fledged workout for the populace.       	1
	didn't want to put it down.i have been a big fan of dan brown since the da vinci code.	1
	i made a point of reading his earlier works, all of which i found interesting and thought provoking.i have awaited release of the lost symbol, since hearing that it was forthcoming.	1
	i pre-ordered the book for my kindle and after receiving it, i really hated putting it down.	1
	unfortunately for me, my days are fairly busy and my reading is relegated to late evening just before retiring for the night.	1
	i usually read for about one hour, but i had difficulty keeping to that schedule, since i didn't want to stop.	1
	the story grabbed me right from the start and didn't want to let go.	1
	i have read some of the other reviews that were critical of what the reviewers referred to as slow or unnecessary portions of the book.	1
	perhaps those reviews have some merit, but overall, i found the book to be well written and spellbinding.	1
	perhaps the best thing about the book is that it is set here in familiar surroundings.	1
	i have been in or around many of the buildings described in the book, and i can't wait to get back to washington d.c., to explore these locations again      	1
	great followup to the da vinci code.i have read all of dan brown's books and the lost symbol is a fantastic addition to the collection.	1
	dan brown sticks to the same writing style as his other books so if you were not a fan of any other than you will not be a fan of this one either.	1
	however if you do like his other books then you will certainly be pleased to read the lost symbol.	1
	i love books that carry on with the same characters and build upon them, the lost symbol is no exception to this as robert langdon continues his journey in washington, d.c. searching for the freemasons.	1
	fantastic book, one that i highly recommend.      	1
	a true page turner.dan brown has never left me wanting.	1
	this book not only engaged my imagination, but it inspired me to travel and learn more, as have each of his books that i've read.	1
	definitely get this book!      	1
	the lost symbol... didn't disappoint me.i read most of the other reviews and i'm glad i don't put much stock into them.	1
	i loved the book!	1
	good job, dan brown!	1
	i am a true fan.	1
	you always give me more to think about.       	1
	db is a tank.db is a beast author and the book is amazing and i like his views on religion....best book ever      	1
	an accomplishment..i honestly do not understand the bad reviews here.	1
	people seem to have a problem with the plot, others the writing and some the characters in the book.	1
	they seem to forget that dan brown and the publishers never claimed that this was non-fiction.	1
	neither did they claim that this book is factual.	1
	remember people this is a fiction novel and a reader should take it that way.	1
	fiction, for some people, are a means of an escape just like movies are.	1
	i don't think we walk out of movies thinking that the movie is poorly researched or that the director should have done this or the producers should have done that.	1
	writing is an art.	1
	no matter how you write, what you write or where you write it.	1
	if you like 'better prose' or as another person stated, a sentence that would actually make them stop and say 'that was a beautiful sentence,' then go get some shakespeare, tolstoy, homer, dickens, etc...  we all have different opinions on things.	1
	it is simply the way we are.	1
	it is why the world is so diverse and interesting.	1
	however, to criticize someone's work based on our own opinions is nothing short of ignorance.	1
	let's see some of the critics here, who probably have never actually written a book, accomplish what dan brown has accomplished.	1
	write five bestselling novels, two of which were made into movies in addition to one of them being one of the biggest selling books of all time, and the one of which had an unprecedented first printing of five million copies, only then can you really criticize and scrutinize dan brown's work.	1
	no matter what people think, we all have to admit that dan brown has raised the bar in the current book business, let alone mystery novels.       	1
	absolute page turner - loved this!.i actually enjoyed this one more than the davinci code, which i thought was one of the best books ever.	1
	fast paced and fun, a little predictable, but definitely worth the read.	1
	enjoy!      	1
	not like davinci code for sure.not a great one.	1
	i really liked the davinci code, which did not let me sleep until i finish it.but lost symbol... took five days to complete and i skipped few pages because it was boring and it has so many unnecessary and useless details.	1
	after reading 50-60% of the book, i was really waiting for the end.	1
	last 25-30 pages were totally boring.	1
	few things sounded like very silly and stupid.        	1
	another grea one.this was another great book by dan brown.	1
	i love the robert langdon character and i would definately recommend this book.      	1
	veeery exciting!.the book had a ton of information but was very interesting and thrilling to read!	1
	i finished it in two evenings!	1
	the story was very gripping, very detailed but well explained and written.	1
	if one liked the two other bestsellers of dan brown then this book you will enjoy as well.      	1
	it has it all!!.omg!!!!	1
	what a thriller--lots of action, history and spiritual awakening.	1
	a must read for enlightening, yet not preachy.      	1
	a fantastic, thrilling page-turner!!!	1
	!.the lost symbol by dan brown i was the first to get my library copy of mr. brown's long-anticipated sequel to the da vinci code.	1
	the only similarities to that blockbuster novel is that it's another thriller for robert langdon.	1
	this novel takes place in washington, dc where all our nation's important buildings have masonic symbols on them.	1
	and, yes, this absolute thriller and page-turner is all about the masons and their secret society.	1
	since my gg grandfather, my g grandfather and my grandfather were 32nd level, i've known a bit about this organization and my grandmother was in eastern star, the women's group.	1
	from reading this novel, i learned there was one higher level in the masons and that the very elite have that honor of being a                        33rd level.	1
	this story starts out with robert being summoned to the us capitol for a special speaking engagement, but when he arrives, he enters into a completely empty room!!!	1
	within minutes, robert and a few others, including a high ranking cia officer, are shocked to find the severed hand of robert's best friend and mentor, peter solomon, who they find has been kidnapped.	1
	there are flashbacks to earlier days in peter's life where he has seen tragedy, along with his younger sister, katherine, who is an esteemed scientist working on cutting edge technology.	1
	her offices and lab are in a secluded area of the smithsonian museums special center that houses miles upon miles of historical artifacts not seen by the public.	1
	our villain is so cunning and brilliant, he finds a way to get into her lab while she's there doing research.	1
	when you think the coast is clear, this villain is two steps ahead.	1
	i was surprised by how cleverly mr. brown set that up, so that our villain mal'akh, was able to keep that two steps ahead.	1
	our villain so dabbled in the dark arts, it's no wonder he was so evil.	1
	the thing i liked about this book were the interesting facts about our special buildings in washington, like the capitol building, the smithsonian museum, the national cathedral, library of congress, where looks are deceiving.	1
	then the washington monument and the house of the temple, the main masonic temple for the elite 33rd masons.	1
	in this spellbinding novel, there are symbols within symbols and the race is on for robert to solve this puzzle before it's too late.	1
	is it also too late for robert to save both peter's and katherine's lives and even his own or his country?	1
	you better run to get this book to find out!!!!	1
	another reason i thoroughly enjoyed this novel is the short, cliff-hanging chapters, which i so love with mary higgins clark's books.	1
	and, for those who don't like dan brown's books because of all the fabrications in them, you've got to realize these are total fiction and he is a master story-teller!!!	1
	and, this is much better than the da vinci code, at least, in my humble opinion.	1
	forever friends rating a huge 5 stars by teriuntil next time, see you around the book nook.	1

	awesome read.dan brown has done it again.	1
	it is an awesome read.	1
	it is not only a thriller but it reminds people their abilities to reconnect to the divine.	1
	i highly recommend it!      	1
	kholcomb.bought my first kindle and this is the first book i read on it.	1
	loved the first 90% of the book and then it bogged down to a crawl.	1
	the last couple chapters were pure monotony.	1
	that aside, i could not put this one down till i finished.	1
	wow!	1
	dan brown does it again....one wild ride through washington d.c. and american & masonic history.	1
	kudos!	1
	i can't wait for his next publish.      	1
	fascinating.sorry for all the negative reviews!!	1
	i couldn't stop turning the pages, and had no earthly idea who the villian was from the outset, as some reviewers claimed.	1
	you should definitely read this book!       	1
	what a ride.i thoroughly enjoyed this book.	1
	in my opinion it was better than da vinci code.	1
	maybe this has to do with the fact that i have studied and researched the exact subject of this book.	1
	i find it very intriging and if you really want the full experience get the unabridged audio book version of this.	1
	amazing.       	1
	we have found the replacement!!!!!	1
	!.for the cia's waterboarding...now banned by the current administration:  force reading of this shameful waste of trees.	1
	negative 5 stars would be kind.      	1
	most boring danbrown book.i have read all of dan brown's books.	1
	but i can say that this is the most boring book i have read.	1
	it's all about descriptions of rituals,tombs, buildings ,paintings and symbols ...more like a history book.	1
	no plot, very evident twists and boring narration.infact all thru the book i was flipping pages to reach the actual paragraph..!!	1
	i felt like a fool after reading the ending.. its waste of money and most of all waste of your precious time to go through the mountain sized book. 	1
	he's back!.frankly, its been too long waiting for this book!	1
	dan brown's the lost symbol is a terrific  read for anyone looking for a fast paced, enlightening story.	1
	i bought it opening day, put it aside till the weekend and finished it within 48 hours.	1
	why?	1
	because this is the book i was looking for this past summer.	1
	a creative, historical ride alongside robert langdom investigating mysteries built within the freemasons set in washington dc with a rapid fire plot.	1
	dan brown delivers and for that we should all be grateful he didn't just melt under the pressure of previous successes and not complete the lost symbol.	1
	the painstaking detail he provides concerning dc architecture, freemason rituals, and the new sciences such as noetics makes you reread pages and ask questions like 'is that true'?	1
	i loved the journey and was sorry it ended.       	1
	an enjoyable read.there are tons of highly detailed reviews here, so this one will be short....  it's a dan brown novel!	1
	yes, it's along the same vein as angels and davinci...which is why i was looking forward to it so eagerly!      	1
	hope.this book is not only intellectually inspiring but also speaks out the deep explaination towards many sensitive topics.	1
	good job, dan brown!	1
	i highly recommend the fans of dan brown to read this book which is worth the effort and your bucks!	1
	the best quote i like is 'open your minds, my friends.	1
	we all fear what we do not understand.'	1
	this i believe has something to do with religious prejudice.	1
	anyway, it is another surpirse from the author of angels and demons. 	1
	another great dan brown book.loved this book!	1
	i couldn't put it down.	1
	if you are a fan of dan brown - you will enjoy the lost symbol.	1
	but just enjoy it, don't read into so much and expect so much out of it like all these other people bashing it on amazon reviews.	1
	love love looooove!      	1
	not a 'must read'.....having read all of dan browns books at least twice, i was anticipating the release of this book.	1
	unfortunately i am disappointed after finishing the lost symbol.	1
	i have a simple formula for judging a book; 1) do i feel the need to read it every free minute i have?2) after reading it, do i anticipate the next book?3) do i look forward to reading it again?	1
	and the answer is no to all of the above.	1
	i guess dan is a victim of his own success as this book is formulaic at best.	1
	i didn't buy into the idea that the information the cia feared would be released was that big of a deal.	1
	on a positive note, i'm sure washington dc will have many more visitors.....  	1
	for someone who knows dc, a wonderful book.not sure if i liked this book so much because it takes place in a city i know well, or just because dan brown is the only author i know who uses so many real-life landmarks and scientific facts that educate and entertain the reader at the same time.	1
	the book includes many, many, references to washington dc that may not be appreciated by someone who does not know the city, but for me, it made me swell with pride to hear about many of the places i know so well.	1
	whenever dc comes into contact with hollywood, there seems to be a disconnect, as if the city is too serious of a place to provide any entertainment value.	1
	however, for this book, it is a perfect match.	1
	dan brown is exploring much in the book regarding science, religion, faith, and human thought, i.e.	1
	serious topics, and so the personality of dc is well matched for the themes he discusses.	1
	overall, the book was extremely entertaining for me, and i can't wait to re-visit all of the landmarks he cites, although in the new light i will see them, it will probably be like looking at them for the very first time.      	1
	sure there is a formula here...but if it is one you like...you will like..does it really really surprise anyone that this book of dan browns is like his other previous two...demons and angels and the davinci code??	1
	i mean his star character here is specializes in symbols.	1
	there is only so much you can do with that.	1
	maybe people expected to much from all the hype this book received.	1
	it was hard not to be to excited about this book.	1
	i didn't really expect anything different than similar characters, symbols, running around a historical town, and the masons.	1
	i thought the book was a roller coaster going from exciting event into a downplay of explaining of symbols...then tower into excitement only to downspin into another few pages of explaination.	1
	that might be my only complaint was all the explaining.	1
	the book was quite long (over 400 pages), but the time span of this book was 12 hours or so.	1
	thats alot of explaining to be doing.	1
	i do like reading about the historical aspect of his novels, but being a christian it is hard sometimes to just roll my eyes and overlook the religious overtones (that i find incorrect) in his books.	1
	if you like his other books you will enjoy this the same, but only if you didn't get sucked into all the hype.	1
	it was good, but not as good as the hype made it out to be.   	1
	really liked it....i had a difficult time putting this book down.	1
	the theories the author presents in the story challenged me to think about my own beliefs.	1
	the story was full of excitement and twists.	1
	i was able to guess some of the twists before they happened, but not too early on in the story.	1
	it was fast paced and was one of my favorite books now.      	1
	it certainly lived up to my expectations.secret societies have always intrigued me and dan brown's coverage of the masons fulfilled my appetite to understand this highly secretive organization.	1
	brown weaves in just the right amount of fact and fiction to keep the pages turning.	1
	i found myself 'googling' terms, phrases and organizations mentioned in the book - only to find out that they are all true.	1
	i lived in the dc area for 37 years and i thought i understood the city but i will now see it in a new light.        	1
	a really great read - worth the wait.i think most of the dan brown fans were chomping at the bit to get their paws on the lost symbol.	1
	a book about the masons and the founding fathers' showing the way to unity of spirit.the book starts with a bang - our friend robert langdon is called to sub for an old friend peter solomon for a speech at the capitol!	1
	a private jet is sent, limo takes him to the spot he needs to be, but - there is nothing there and nothing scheduled that evening!as langdon is trying to figure out what the deal is - they find a hand of a man wearing a 32nd degree masonic ring literally staked to the floor - with a call for robert langdon who immediately recognizes the hand as his friend and mentor peter solomon.	1
	yikes!what a brilliant start to a book.	1
	as a matter of fact the events of the book proceed in an amazingly fast and furious pace, then get stymied in katherine solomon's (peter solomon's brilliant sister) secret experiments.	1
	her work is very important to the book, but not fully explained, so it tended to slow the action down.	1
	the experiments are later explained and that is a wow moment.as katherine and landgon team up to find her brother and see what the code of a package solomon had given langdon long ago.	1
	they are dealing with security agencies clashes - who are the good folks, who are not to be trusted?there were sections of symbol i reread - specifically where langdon is trapped in a box and liquid is starting to fill up and will drown him if he doesn't give info to the bad guy.	1
	what is described afterwards is fascinating and i marvel at brown's descriptions of langdon's experiences.i have to admit when i go to dc next month i will watch the various places mentioned in the book with a different eye.	1
	clues hidden in pain view.from our currency to buildings.the pace starts up and secrets are revealed proving those masons and the ones who controlled things back then when washington dc was being built were plain amazing.where the lost symbol is not my favorite dan brown book, it is another thriller in the works with the makings of a great film.so many theories, so many things to think about, you will be wondering about this book for a long time to come.	1
	sincerely senseless sequel.i slogged through this book over two days.	1
	it was tough going.	1
	boring plot.	1
	predictable secondary characters.	1
	ridiculous antagonist.	1
	while the davinci code was at least redeemed by a semblance of originality, the lost symbol was only symbolic of a mediocre writer working worn-out, warmed-over material.	1
	i regret the time wasted on this book--the writer's, the editor's and mine.      	1
	national treasure 3 - since the masons like threes.dan brown wrote a masterpiece in angels and demons, and a pop culture phenomenon in the da vinci code.	1
	the feeling you get after reading this book is that it has been dumbed down to cater to anyone who knows the alphabet.	1
	personally, i think organizations like the freemasons have the right to preserve their strange and occult rituals and this should not have read like a tmz expose on them.	1
	the motivation of the antagonist is weak and does not have that small percentage of palatability that a good villain should have, except for dan brown's man-crush on his physique.	1
	for what its worth, i figured out his identity within the first 100 pages and was hoping for a decent ending.	1
	i was sorely disappointed, but i will give this dark little cloud a silver lining.	1
	i think this book has an undercurrent of agnosticism and is subtle in pushing the reader to see that point of view.	1
	i am not a religious person, but i think it will push at those who are strong believers if they let themselves wander away for a bit.	1
	if it is effective in that manner, then my time was not totally wasted.	1
	for now - 2/5.      	1
	a pleasant surprise!.i figured the next book about robert langdon would be more along the lines of angels and demons, mostly because the davinci code was just a perfect storm of a wonderful story.	1
	but i was pleased with this story, it's background and what i was able to learn about the nation's capital in a manner that was entertaining.my husband didn't care for the book because it was full of anxiety and conflict, and he was reading it on vacation where he was looking for rest and relaxation.	1
	i enjoyed the the page turning desire it created!      	1
	why kill the main character?.why would anyone think people would enjoy such a cruel description of the main character's death?	1
	it's beyond comprehension.	1
	dan brown you are done and out, i will never read anything with your signature on it!	1
	disgusting!!	1
	!      	1
	disappointing read.i didn't finish this book.	1
	the same cat and mouse chase.	1
	if they make this into a movie it will have to be filmed mostly in the dark.	1
	i loved davinci and angels and demons.	1
	save your money and time.      	1
	disappointment.i skimmed the last couple chapters just to 'finish' the book.	1
	in reflection i feel this was written more for the money than for the reader.	1
	i have read and enjoyed all of dan's other books, but this was a big disappointment.      	1
	it works for me.despite the criticisms of this book, (many of which are valid), i found it wonderfully entertaining.	1
	if you're looking for a literary masterpiece, perhaps you should look elsewhere -- but if you just plain want to curl up in bed with a good book, this is it       	1
	i loved it!.plausibility aside, i loved this book for a few simple reasons: (1) it is a wonderful 'guilty pleasure' or great escapism;  (2) it is extremely fast-paced and fun/easy to read; (3) i found it much more interesting than 'davinci code' and 'angles and demons'; (4) it had the perfect amount of twists and turns, one of which completely shocked me; (5) the ending truly satisfied me; and (6) i walked away from it feeling i learned something new.	1
	while at times i'll admit there was a little too much 'teaching' for my taste, and i felt the author tried too hard to impress with the tremendous amount of research he had done, i really can't complain because of the six reasons i listed above.	1
	(and because i respect the fact that so much research and thought went into writing the novel.)	1
	i highly recommend the book and am a bit surprised so many people didn't love it like i did.	1
	therefore, i would recommend approaching it with an open mind and remembering its a work of fiction.    	1
	book review.the story kept my attention till the very end just like 'the da vinci code' and 'angels and demons'.      	1
	not very good dan brown.wasn't a good day to write eh dan;  this book was terrible especially the way it ened.	1
	thats about all i can say.	1
	wish i would have read some of the other reviews           rick      	1
	lost symbol.loved the book.	1
	it is an easy read.	1
	constant twist in the plot, keeps you looking for more.	1
	the things mentioned, like noetic science, can be found easily on the internet.	1
	they do exist.i was skeptical at first, but all references can be found.it gives you a good look at the true nature of free masons.	1
	what they really beleive and the betterment of humanity.	1
	i would recommend this book to anyone who likes fast moving action and suspence.      	1
	couldn't put it down.i've waited for years for a new dan brown book and this was a fun read i coulsn't wait to get to the next page.      	1
	more of the same.i like dan brown's stuff, but it seems to me that '...symbol' is just more of robert langdon scurrying around breaking codes and saving the world (maybe not that) with a woman who's not his love interest.	1
	whatever happened to vittoria vetra from 'a & d'?	1
	anyway, we've seen all this before in 'da vinci code' and 'a & d'.	1
	i liked this one well enough though, despite the recurring visions i had of tom hanks (a fine actor, by the way).	1
	i would like something new from brown.      	1
	good read.i read this book a couple of weeks ago, and i must say that i was glad that freemasons were not treated the same way opus dei was in davinci code.	1
	although the puzzles were a bit easier to solve that in past books the plot and characters were as good if not better.      	1
	literary stickum.back in 1980 lester hayes, fred biletnikoff, and other nfl players used a product called 'stickum' to keep from dropping the football.	1
	somehow dan brown has come up with the literary equivalent of that substance.	1
	once this book is in the reader's hands it is very hard to drop.	1
	mr. brown has given protagonist robert landon another challenge .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	and lives are at stake!	1
	the inability to determine friend and foe makes this dash through washington, dc, and the deciphering of the coded masonic-related symbols within the city, a 'breath-holder' from the prologue to the story's explosive climax.	1
	mr. brown's ability to eloquently and delicately blur the lines between fact and fiction made this writer travel to the nation's capital to see what was real and what was not and to, at least to some degree, experience the thrill of the chase. 	1
	dan brown did it again!.as i read the davinci code, i was rivited to the book from the beginning to the end.	1
	i just purchased the lost symbol, expecting another riveting novel and have not been disappointed.	1
	i love dan brown's writing style, which is a mixture of fact and fiction all blended together to keep us completely engrossed in both of his novel's.	1
	i heard, on a cbs interview, that another book is in the works.	1
	i am excited with greater expectations than before.i am convinced that, if you appreciated the literary style of the davinci code, you will not be disappointed with this, the lost symbol      	1
	good read, the davinci code still my favorite.i really did not fully like this book till the end.	1
	it was a good read, i did enjoy it.	1
	my father was a mason and my mother was part of the eastern star, so i enjoyed the historical information.      	1
	the lost symbol.i'm a big dan brown so needless to say i loved this book.	1
	the fast moving plot and all the rich descriptions made me not want to quit reading.	1
	in fact, i read it in one day.	1
	the historical facts about how washington was built held my attention and made me want to go back and visit d.c. to see what i missed on other trips.	1
	i highly recommend 'the lost symbol'.      	1
	as always dan brown entertains.i downloaded dan brown's latest book on my kindle the day it became available for two reasons:  (1) i'm a huge fan and (2) i was visiting washington dc the same week it came out and i wanted to visit various sites in the book.	1
	i was delighted to read it quickly and when on a personal tour of the capital i pointed out to our guide several items for discussion which he knew nothing about, i.e., the painting of washington (as a god) on ceiling of capital dome and the indentations directly under the dome where the railings were at one time which surrounded the hole in the floor.	1
	also, at the b & b where we were staying our host worked for the architect's office at the capital and we discussed the book on several occasions; dan brown does great research.	1
	i did enjoy the book, would recommend the book, and will wait patiently until this book is made into a movie as well.	1
	i just wish ron howard had selected another actor to play the lead role - he just doesn't fit to me.        	1
	another masonic novel.i titled this 'another masonic novel' since there have been so, so many novels written recently using the secrets of the masons as a story line.	1
	i would have expected brown to come up with a new group, even if fictitious, to build his story around.	1
	that said, the novel is well written and, thank goodness, well proofed.	1
	i found the characters interesting and the plot twists to be well chosen and well placed within the book.	1
	i think he could have worked a little harder on the ending and given us one more twist.	1
	still i rated it four stars since it was a very enjoyable reading experience.  	1
	the lost symbol.wow!!!!	1
	!what a book.	1
	dan brown is a brilliant writer.	1
	i have read 3 of his novels, and they are excellent.	1
	i hope the lost symbol, becomes a movie, although, his books are better.	1
	i could not put this book down, the book is writeen in such a way that it propels you to want to know what happened next.	1
	excellent!!!!	1
	!      	1
	dan brown's best yet.very fast paced action, drama, and suspense wrapped around the true story of our founding fathers and their committment to truth and to illustrating that truth in the traditions of the masonic brotherhood.	1
	as the masons have always illustrated the higher truths in sacred geometries made of stone, so has dan brown created the perect mix of history, mystery and mysticism.      	1
	first on the block to have the new dan brown book, thanks to amazon.i wanted to thank my two friends for their wonderful support during a very sad time for me, and since they are avid readers i wanted to give them the new dan brown book, the lost symbol.	1
	since amazon offered it so quickly and at such a great discount they were indeed impressed when i presented it to them before they even realized it was available.	1
	now, i'm hoping they'll let me read it when they're done with it.	1
	i love the convenience of buying things on amazon.         	1
	a good read but....i've read all of dan brown's books and especially liked the previous two with the langdon character.	1
	i found 'the lost symbol' to be creative but slower paced and even tedious to read at times.	1
	it was also very predictable for the most part.	1
	i still recommend the book (and dan brown) but like the others better.      	1
	good third book!	1
	kindle 2 readers beware!	1
	no 'text to speech'.my husband and i both enjoyed this book very much.	1
	i won't repeat some of the other criticisms about it being too long etc.	1
	i agree with that, but we enjoyed a recent trip to washington d. c. more just because we made a point to visit places in his book that dan brown talked about at length.	1
	we enjoyed both of his other books and movies too.	1
	i hope he continues to write, but maybe makes a change and writes something a little bit different.	1
	just a warning note to kindle 2 readers.	1
	this particular book does not have 'text to speech' enabled.	1
	neither of us realized that could happen at all, and didn't notice amazons disclosure, located just below the price.	1
	its not amazons fault that we didn't notice, so i am not assigning blame to anyone, other than myself.	1
	my husband read the book first on his original kindle and enjoyed it so much that he suggested i download it on my kindle 2 so we could listen to it in the car on our trip to washington d. c.  we were very disappointed and ended up with me reading the whole book outloud to us both.	1
	boy was that a tiring experience.	1
	just wanted to warn any other stupid kindle 2 owners, like me.	1
	if you think you might want to listen to a book, be sure and check before downloading it to make sure that the 'text to speech' is enabled on the book you want.	1
	the publisher and author make a decision about the feature and whether to make it available.        	1
	good job!.this book was great entertainment.	1
	i didn't want to put the book down and i thought about it while trying to sleep.	1
	i even googled some of the info.	1
	thanks dan, kane      	1
	why, why, why?.why did i think i would like this?why did i read this book?why did i buy it?	1
	heed this warning.      	1
	love dan brown!.i ordered my book prior to its release date, and was surprised and delighted to find it delivered to my house on the day it was released!!!	1
	love amazon...and love dan brown!	1
	i can't wait to order his next book...although i'm sure it won't be for quite a while.	1
	i feel he is the greatest author of our time!      	1
	great read.this is one of those authors who stay close to what they know, and it works wonderfully.	1
	i recommend this book to his fans and first time readers alike.       	1
	great read!.i enjoyed this book even more than i enjoyed angels and demons and the davinci code.      	1
	another dan brown winner!.this book is set in washington dc and deals with masonic lore and myth.	1
	mr. brown dealt fairly with this great organization and for that i am grateful.	1
	if you are a dan brown fan, then i don't need to sell you on this book, but if you haven't read mr. brown and like a good solid mystery, then this book will hold your attention and keep you interested right to the end of the book.	1
	it's a keeper.      	1
	some great, some good, & some awful.i have incredibly mixed feelings about this book.	1
	if you asked me my thoughts while i was reading it, they varied among 'i love it!,' 'it's really good!,' 'i can't stop rolling my eyes!,' 'when will it end?,' and 'well, it's not very good, but i really like it.'	1
	i completely understand why the ratings at amazon are so disparate.	1
	there are parts of this book i would rate 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars.	1
	different readers will place more importance on some parts than others, and with this book more than any other book i've read, i would find it impossible to predict a reader's reaction.	1
	here's how i viewed the book: 1 star elements: the ubiquitous italics; there are other ways to emphasize things you want the reader to pay attention too.	1
	as a reader, i abhor this technique.	1
	my eye tends to glance around the page and picks up on things that are different.	1
	the italics distract me, and they really serve no literary purpose here.	1
	the watches.	1
	i get it; langdon has a mickey mouse watch.	1
	it's important to him; it's irrelevant after the first mention, and it's annoying in a suspenseful scene.	1
	the fact that katherine also has a very special watch given to her by her parents is laughable, but at least it was only mentioned once.	1
	i suppose she wasn't as concerned with time as langdon.	1
	the formulaic romance.	1
	i loved angels and demons (and i want to read it again to see if my opinion has changed), and i thought the davinci code was mediocre at best (i credit growing up in both a church and intellectual community, but i found nothing shocking or outrageous in the book, and after angels and demons, it seemed formulaic).	1
	i am willing to suspend my sense of reality for the sake of a good mystery or adventure story.	1
	i am not willing to overlook the fact that for three books now, robert langdon happens to end up solving a very important mystery with a ridiculously intelligent, articulate and attractive woman who has some very close relation to the man (whom langdon is also closely related to somehow).	1
	at least there was a quick mention of what happened to the angels and demons woman in the da vinci code.	1
	here: nada.	1
	as a woman who has a fondness for intelligent, worldly men, the idea of these women falling for langdon seems improbable at best and laughable at worst.	1
	the sexism.	1
	hearing alleged intellectuals walk around talking about 'man's secrets' is infuriating.	1
	hearing katherine talking about mankind rather than humanity is worse.	1
	for a book so concerned with being forward thinking, dan brown could use a seminar in appropriate language and gender bias.	1
	2 star elements: the villain (i'll avoid specifics in case you haven't read it).	1
	he's too unbelievable.	1
	he's so unbelievable he wasn't scary.	1
	i like a villain with a few doses of humanity or something about him or her i can relate to.	1
	3 star elements: although i liked parts of it, it was all too much.	1
	it was too long, too hard to maintain that much intensity for that many pages.	1
	the resolution was unsatisfying.	1
	4 star elements: the idea of this book is cool.	1
	i like adventure stories.	1
	the thrill of the chase was fun.	1
	for 80% of the book, i really enjoyed katherine as a character.	1
	she was intelligent, open-minded and inspiring.	1
	i appreciate she got to make some discoveries instead of our intrepid hero, but as i said earlier, her use of mankind instead of humanity rubbed me the wrong way, and i don't think she would fall for robert langdon.	1
	this paragraph: 'is there?	1
	is it not possible that we are still living in the dark ages, still mocking the suggestion of 'mystical' forces that we cannot see or comprehend.	1
	history, if it has taught us anything at all, has taught us that the strange ideas we deride today will one day be our celebrated truths.	1
	i claim i can transform the pyramid with a touch of my finer, and you question my sanity.	1
	i would expect more from an historian.	1
	history is replete with great minds who have all proclaimed the same thing...great mind who have all insisted that man possesses mystical abilities of which he is unaware.'	1
	p. 308 5 star elements: whether you consider it science fiction, science, an interesting religious view, or just unsettling, noetic science is intriguing and fascinating.	1
	the ideas in this book made me think, even if the book also made me groan.	1
	i'll give you this point, dan brown, i didn't tweet about noetics, but i am blogging about it.	1
	will i read the next dan brown novel?	1
	probably.	1
	here's what i would like to see dan brown do: first, write children's books.	1
	wouldn't it be fun to see a sixth-grade robert langdon solving little mysteries?	1
	the problems could be more elementary too, and it would fit perfectly.	1
	another option would be to have langdon have a daughter who suddenly appears and wants to get into symbology.	1
	a young adult heroine is born.	1
	she could follow him around the world learning and solving little puzzles.	1
	these formulas would work for children's books, but i find them getting old in adult books.	1
	i'm pretty much done with langdon as a hero.	1
	if he comes back, i'd really like to see him in a more supporting role, or at least an equitable role.	1
	katherine had the most to do of his female characters, but she still felt too much like a sidekick for someone who knew more than langdon in many pivotal scenes.	1
	if langdon comes back as the hero, and he inevitably will, can one of his three female sidekicks also return?	1
	i can't stand adding another one.	1
	i loved parts, and i enjoyed parts, but as a whole, it's mediocre and likable.	1
	am i glad i read it?	1
	absolutely.	1
	would i recommend it?	1
	only if you'll talk to me about it.      	1
	laus deo or praise god--is fine with me--but the thriller brown built around it fails miserably..robert langdon, the harvard professor in symbols, is summoned by his mason friend, peter solomon, to give a lecture in washington, dc, at the national statuary hall inside the u. s. capitol.	1
	as he arrives, there is nobody inside the room and he discovers he has been falsely summoned.	1
	langdon is faced with the severed hand if his friend, peter solomon, with symbols on it.	1
	langdon recognizes it as the 'hand of mysteries,' which represents an 'invitation to receive secret knowledge--protected wisdom known only by an elite few.'	1
	peter solomon has been kidnapped, and to save him, langdon must use his knowledge of symbols to decipher  the most secretly guarded knowledge of the order of the masons.	1
	the ancient mysteries refer to a body of secret knowledge that was amassed long ago.	1
	it enables its practitioners to access powerful abilities that lie dormant in the human mind.	1
	it was kept secret from the masses because it was considered far too potent and dangerous for the initiated in the mason ways.	1
	langdon is shocked when inspector inouc sato of the cia, a mason herself, takes charge and calls the events a matter of national security.	1
	apparently langdon had a small pyramid that he brought for the lecture that when united with the golden cap provided by another mason, would form a message that once deciphered would give immense power to the beholder.	1
	the legend of the masonic pyramid states that the masons, in order to fulfill their responsibility of protecting their great wisdom for future generations, decided to hide it in a great fortress--since the masons has transported the secret wisdom from the old world to the new world in a hidden pyramid designed to protect the ancient mysteries until the time that all of mankind was ready to handle it.	1
	to save his friend, and decipher the secrets of the pyramid, langdon is aided by katherine solomon, peter's sister, and many other masons.	1
	he is plunged into a clandestine world of masonic secrets, hidden history--all of which leads to a single inconceivable truth:  a password--verbum significatum--which is said to hold the power to lift the darkness and unlock ancient mysteries, opening them to all human understanding.	1
	they face a new arch-enemy: someone by the name of mal'akh--a mason himself and surprisingly related to the solomons.	1
	the book is extremely hard to follow, new characters are introduced every chapter or two.	1
	the ridiculous amount of research at the beginning of each chapter, as we change to a new location in dc is distracting and annoying.	1
	brown's many references to his prior work: the da vinci code, are also distracting and annoying.	1
	the revelations that two supreme court justices, the secretary of defense, the speaker of the house, several prominent senators, including the majority leader, the secretary of homeland security and the director of the cia are masons and if revealed would cause a major catastrophe is ridiculous at most, and not worth reading 509 pages to find out.	1
	finally, the revelation that the bible is the encrypted text, filled with a hidden layer, a concealed message that was veiled in allegory, symbolism, and parable--again is not worth reading 509 pages to arrive to that conclusion.	1
	i really don't think this will cause the catholic church much furor, thus he will not get as much  free publicity.	1
	'god is very real--a mental energy that pervades everything--and it was our minds that were created in the image of god--as soon as we humans begin to harness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world.'	1
	laus deo or praise god--is fine with me--but the thriller brown built around it fails miserably.      	1
	getting an important message out.though i seldom read fiction, i thorougly enjoyed dan brown's 'the lost symbol.'	1
	as a teacher in the consciousness movement for nearly 30 years, i am thrilled that through this book dan brown is introducing the very important and timely topic of the co-creative power of thought and intention to such a very, very wide audience.	1
	having personally spent time in dialogue with lynn mctaggart and other scientists sharing similar views on the power of consciousness such as deepak chopra, gregg braden, bruce lipton and elizabet sahtouris, i appreciate how dan has handled the explanation of this science in such a creative, yet accurate, way.	1
	thank you, dan!	1
	wendy craig-purcell, author of 'ask yourself this!'	1
	[asin:087159336x ask yourself this: questions to open the heart, expand the mind and awaken the soul]]      	1
	one star too many.one million sold in a day!	1
	what can you say?	1
	god help us.      	1
	really an excellent story, you won't be disappointed..i have really enjoyed dan browns other books and this one was worth the wait.	1
	i did the audio version and the narrator was terrific, i literally couldn't put it down.	1
	i will buy the hard copy and add it to my library as i'll enjoy this one again.       	1
	proved he is a b- writer.this book is even more outlandish than angels and demons, let alone the davinci code.	1
	the thing that really bothers me about the book is how dan keeps inserting italics when someone has a thought.        	1
	swine flu shot: check.	1
	furnace overhauled: check.	1
	read the lost symbol: check....ah, autumn, a time of mellow fruitfulness and mass idiocy!	1
	no, its okay, i don't mean to be bitter.	1
	not now.	1
	not yet.	1
	i'll save that for two years from now, when the 2,493rd person asks me if i've read it.	1
	i will say, as a librarian, that i enjoyed the chase scene using the conveyor belts at the loc: we have those at my library, and i can't wait to try that.       	1
	going through the motions.it's difficult for me to imagine that this book took a long time to write.	1
	cut and paste large passages from older books, update names, sprinkle in a few myths, some half-baked science and .... there you have it: a new dan brown novel.	1
	even langdon seems bored with his fate.	1
	avoid this book.      	1
	i'm pretty sure it did not go down like this.	1
	'i'm pretty sure it went down like this,' a hollywood snapshot of the genesis of dan's brown's latest, is hilarious, and the author who penned it has oodles and oodles of talent; that's plain to see.	1
	however, having read 'the lost symbol'  i cannot for the life of me see justification for the author of the review, valannin, a fellow writer according to his website, to rate the book one star.	1
	one star ratings typically reflect one of two things: either the book is sufficiently without merit,  incoherent,  one of the worst books in print or, the reviewer has a chip on his shoulder.	1
	in this case, it appears to be the latter.	1
	if one is going to be strictly honest, dan brown's 'the lost symbol' is a monstrous work of research and effort.	1
	as a thriller, it falls short due to some rather lame plotting and a weak climax but for many readers, myself included, the journey that brown creates, a voyage filled with conspiracy theories  and magic and mysticism,  is the key to his success.	1
	this is what keeps us turning pages late into the night.	1
	and in some ways, this journey reminds me of james redfield's  'the celestine prophecy' in as-much as both, although disparate in story and setting, are really metaphysical lessons packed into fiction wrappers.	1
	some people wouldn't dream of picking up a metaphysical handbook such as 'the seven spiritual laws of success' by deepak chopra or rhonda byrne's 'the secret,' but learning from fiction is a very novel idea, and dan brown manages to do it as well, if not better than anyone on the planet.	1
	if you do not believe that we humans are creators and that our thoughts are potent tools of physical, material creation you might not  might enjoy 'the lost symbol' as much as i did and you might not be as forgiving for some of brown's ramblings and repetitiveness.	1
	if you find objection to brown's  scientific molds, i respectfully submit that you think back to the days of hg wells and jules verne--flying to the moon, ridiculous, journeying to the bottom of the sea, farcical.	1
	if on the other hand, you are willing to suspend judgments and comparisons, and if you are willing to take the plunge into the world of fiction where some things require a leap in faith or a suspension in belief (as in most fiction) then you might find dan brown's 'the lost symbol' to be quite a ride, worth every penny.            	1
	lost symbol.another 'can't put the book down'.	1
	parts you scream, 'no'....  hope they make this in to a movie.	1
	can't believe the whole book revolves around one day.....that blew my mind.	1
	nice that he picked the national capitol for his book.	1
	can't wait for next book...      	1
	fun, i'm enjoying it, nice pieces of information.i really enjoyed this fast paced intrigue.	1
	i'm fond of dan brown, i know it is quite trendy to criticise his work negatively and it sounds utterly stupid to me.ok the recipe is always the same but if you enjoy a cook, you also enjoy tasting the same cakes a few times with only a little new spice at a given time.i understand why so many people despise brown's writing, it is too infused with truths and carthesian people have a hard time deciphering the true from the tale, they suffer from a little deception, both meanings.well if you enjoyed the contents, both the tale and the truths, then you'll probably enjoy some of the source such as dr kelly's book the human antenna.nks dan for your books, at least i'm not dead bored in my bed all day long.      	1
	good fun..not his best, but still full of fun, thrills and some interesting info and thought provoking perspectives.       	1
	wasted my time.i bought this for my kindle despite the reviews.	1
	i am glad i only spent $10.00.	1
	much too long, too much mysticism.	1
	the entire last chapter was a waste.	1
	had hoped  for so much more.	1
	i tend to ignore reviews and  make my own judgment.	1
	i will likely tell my wife that i would not wast my time if i were her.      	1
	this is my last dan brown book.angels and demons was his best book.	1
	the information offered in the da vinci code was enough to keep me turning pages even though his idea of a plot (apart from some masterful puzzle work) was to give a lecture, then send his protagonists on the run again.	1
	indeed, the da vinci code encouraged me to buy and read the holy blood, the holy grail.	1
	but this book!	1
	i am 1/3 of the way into it and am not sure i will be able to finish.	1
	so far i've met a sneering, self-congratulatory villain who has about as much depth as the page he's written on, a langdon who seems amazingly stupid, and i've read a lot of other stuff that is so timeworn from exposure i can't even claim to be learning anything new.	1
	when i bought the book the clerk warned me that she had heard quite a few people say it was a slow starter.	1
	okay, so having spent a small fortune on it, maybe i'll keep slogging, but it will take more than the last 35 pages (as one reviewer recommended) to make me buy another dan brown novel.	1
	maybe the ions and noetic sciences stuff is new enough to most readers to keep them intrigued, so let me add a disclaimer: i read mctaggart years ago, i belong to ions, and none of that stuff will be sufficient to hold my interest if he gives it the same treatment he gives the masons.	1
	to my way of thinking brown proves that you don't have to be a good writer, you just have to have a great premise.      	1
	same old convoluted violence outshines the power of intention.i was so excited when i learned dan brown's latest referred extensively to noetic sciences and lynne mctaggart's work, the intention experiment and the field.	1
	it was the only reason i began reading it.	1
	unfortunately, mr. brown focused far more on torture and ponderous action than the power of focused intention.	1
	i confess to asking my husband to finish it for me as it was just another dan brown epic.	1
	nothing my husband read suggested i would enjoy it.	1
	(his review: that's 5 hours i'll never get back.)	1
	very disappointed.      	1
	read the last 35 pages first!?	1
	dan brown redeems himself!.unlike 'the davinci code', this book seems to do more good than harm, especially in the last 35 pages.	1
	by this i mean that this book doesn't badmouth any church or religion, whereas that book sensationalized and alleged too many possibly evil & negative beliefs and practices, etc., such as its descriptions of the catholic church's opus dei organization.	1
	also,i read 'the davinci code,' and felt that it was much more confusing than this book.	1
	i admit i'm biased in favor of this book because i have fewer prejudices about freemasonry and christianity and institutional religion in general than many people do.	1
	"this book pleased me for the following reasons, among many:	-it explains and even praises the many merits of the bible and other books of 'scripture';	-it encourages hope that we are now discovering new science which might unlock vast powers to mankind;	-the descriptions of u.s. history and of washington, d.c., are so fascinating that now i want to use the world wide web's photo services to explore that city, from the air and from the ground, to see for myself what would take weeks of walking (and flying overhead) to see; it is 'humanistic' enough to please the secularists and maybe even the agnostics and atheists;	-and, since i don't have time now for a longer review, i must resort to:' ...and much, much more!'"	1
	this is also a fairly good thriller.	1
	very bad.horrible, at least 300 pages too long.	1
	the words 'suddenly, everything made sense..' or a different version of it were used i would guess 25 times in the book.	1
	i mean its a good way to build suspense but by the fourth time i just felt 'seriously, everything makes sense.. again' very bad, i really i hadn't wasted the time or money to read.      	1
	more then i expected.i will say that when i first found out that the lost symbol was to be coming out i became a little nervous due to the fact that i love dan brown's books.	1
	i was worried because the setting was different it isn't placed in europe, and also the idea of free masonary to me sounded almost boring.	1
	this book when i finished it exceeded any expectations i had for it.	1
	flat out getting to the point i loved it so much.	1
	while its true the plot twist at the end was somewhat obvious if you read the book and paid attention, the book itself contained historical evidence and true logic like other dan brown books this one might be tested as false.	1
	for me after reading this book through twice and loving it more the second time i've concluded these three things: 1. dan brown is one of the best authors i've ever come by2.	1
	this book is intelligent and witty... just the way i like it.3.	1
	in my opinion the order of amazingness of the robert langdon adventures goes as follows:       3. da vinchi code       2. the lost symbol        1. angels and demons.	1
	this book is no angels and demons but it cuts it pretty close.	1
	all in all, i say dan brown has hit another home run with this book.      	1
	very disappointing.if you must read this book get it from the library, not worth the paper it was printed on.......      	1
	what's not to like?.i am listening to the audio version of this book - simply because i am in the middle of reading another large book and i can listen to the book at work rather than music.	1
	i am perplexed at the 2 and 3 star ratings that this seems to be receiving.	1
	this is a highly entertaing book.	1
	formulaic?	1
	yes, a bit.sort of so-so in parts?	1
	yes, it is.	1
	when i read historical fiction i read it because i love it and because i make a game a game out of checking the historical facts to the novel.	1
	when i read a novel, such as 'the lost symbol' i read it strictly to be entertained -and i expect nothing more.	1
	an added bonus for me with this book is that it presents a lot of american history that is quite accurate.	1
	i can picture some of the places in the book from visits to washington dc.	1
	if this was dan brown's first book rather than his second i wager people would up their star rating.	1
	there is nothing not to like about this book imho!	1
	ps: if you go for the audio version - the nnarrator is quite good too!       	1
	an instant best seller.	1
	dan brown's the lost symbol has been all hyped up for months even years but once the hype dies down get ready to enjoy one of the best reads of the year.	1
	in dan's third adventure for professor langdon we find ourselves in washington dc where the good professor is on a flight for his life through the sub-basement of  the capitol to some very esteemed washington addresses to the top of the washington monument all the while on a fight to save the life of a friend.	1
	dan gives us some great new adversaries and supporters with his characters whom he is intimately acquainted with make the novel exciting and impossible to put down.	1
	the plot is original and like that other lesser know novel that he wrote is full of ciphers, codes, science and great mysteries, he draws the reader into his story by filling it full of fact along with the fiction.	1
	he gives professor langdon another shot at romance with the enigmatic dr. katherine solomon, does it succeed, well you'll just have to read it to find out.	1
	his dialogue is fast paced and exhilarating and takes the reader at top speed through these 509 pages of nail biting, heart thumping excitement.	1
	mr. brown does not disappoint with the lost symbol, he gives his fan's just what they've been waiting for so long.	1
	so to all the so called 'experts' who have pooh-poohed this novel even before publication i say you must not have read the same novel as i did.	1
	but find out for yourselves, don't let 'them' tell you what to read and what to like.	1
	read the book and i promise you won't be disappointed.      	1
	cut and paste but fun to read !.3-books -- 3 cities (paris, rome, d.c.) but these are the same plot/story line features in all the books: 1- a body/body part is discovered in a significant historic public building.2- the body/body part has mystical engravings on it dating from an ancient organization.3- our hero langdon is abruptly called in to decode the engravings.4- he meets an attractive female.5- langdon and an associate are chased thru the (above) building by the 'authorities' and in the process pass some rather significant art, cultural and architectural objects.6- an artifact is the key to the solution of the code.7 - there's a 'gray beard' who knows the history of the ancient code and he is consulted by our hero accompanied by the attractive female.8- (need i go on ???)	1
	these are all a cut-and-paste from the first 'angles and demons'have we been duped by this clever writer ???	1
	now let's see what will my next block buster be about ?	1
	?only thing i need to do is figure out the city -- new york = ?, ... london = ?	1
	?	1
	?it's for sure it ain't gona' be telephone, texas !!	1
	that would never garner a 5 million copy first run - huh ?the plot/story line is all a cut and paste !	1
	!	1
	boring.i only made it ti page 252, and i had to put it down,the most boring, text like, dull storey i have tried to read.this book is so bad i would give it 0 stars.	1
	do not waste a dime reading this insanity, unless of course you like insane things.      	1
	im shocked.this book has gotten so many mixed reviews.	1
	ive read a&d; and tdc and think this is the best of the three.	1
	the lost symbol is fast paced, clever, and suspenseful.	1
	the bad guy in this one is fiendish and extremely creepy.	1
	nothing is too far over the top such as is in the ending of a&d; (novel).	1
	i found this to be well worth the wait and extremely satisfying.	1
	studying the various religious traditions for over 15 years and being a freemason may be the reason why i am extremely biased in favor of this great adventure.       	1
	a minor miracle.i think this book is a minor miracle.	1
	it is a crackling, 'just one more chapter' thriller that you can't wait to finish but never want to end.	1
	that alone is reason enough to read it.	1
	but what makes it miraculous is the way mr. brown manages to weave challenging philosophical premises as well as 'i have got to google that' details and facts into that cotton candy that is the plot.	1
	i have no patience for those those who criticize mr. brown's work as 'pop-academia' and 'low-brow literature.'	1
	he aims neither to create serious academic treatises nor challenging art.	1
	as far as i can tell he is simply trying to tell a rip-roaring story that manages to shock us with information that is hidden right in front of us.	1
	of course writing that kind of story is anything but simple as the success of the davinci code spawned countless imitators who (as far as i know) never came close to creating the kind of reading experience that mr. brown has again managed to do.	1
	it's an absolute blast.	1
	read it.       	1
	judge for yourself.it's not shakespeare and it's not dr seuss.	1
	you've heard of dan brown, dvc and angels and demons.	1
	you know what to expect here.	1
	excuse me that i'm not an elitist, pinky in the air, tea sippin' snob.	1
	it's a book.	1
	read it and when you're done, move on to the next book.	1
	at the very least, you get to spend a day running around dc.	1
	there's no need to write a 1000+ word thesis on the book...and by the way...it's fiction.	1
	that means not real.	1
	last, how often is there an original novel these days?	1
	please.      	1
	couldn't put it down.i loved both angels and demons and the da vinci code and couldn't wait to read the next installment.	1
	it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.	1
	i had such a hard time putting it down at night.	1
	wonderful follow up to da vinci code.       	1
	the lost symbol.this a very bad effort by dan brown do not waste your money on book.	1
	its about 400 pages too long and the other 200 pages are not worth reading.      	1
	i care about dan brown's future as a writer, so.......i respectfully offer one critique for mr. brown's 'the lost symbol.'	1
	the product placement offers provided by iphone, blackberry, escalade and lexus simply aren't worth the potential harm to your hard-earned reputation as an exquisitely gifted story teller.	1
	go back to your nature.	1
	imagine how different the world would be today if da vinci had painted the mona lisa  holding a bottle of coca-cola.	1
	if the offers from those product manufacturers are too good to pass up, write and star in a series of dan brown style commercials for them.	1
	otherwise, the book was an intelligent page-turner with a delightfully deranged villain.      	1
	fantastic!.i have never read dan brown's books prior to this one.	1
	what was i thinking?	1
	i loved every minute of it!	1
	it seems like a lot of reviewers are disappointed because they think the lost symbol is too familiar to his previous entries, but for those of you who haven't picked up a dan brown book i highly recommend it!       	1
	the lost symbol: a loser.	1
	even good writers write bad books.	1
	dan brown's latest hyped novel, the lost symbol, is one.	1
	the story begins interestingly enough but as it slogs on it is soon secondary to a mish mash of esoteric stuff.	1
	brown's character, robert langdon, harvard symbologist is called to give a lecture at the u. s. capitol building.	1
	his caller is (allegedly) an old friend and mentor who he hasn't had contact with in 10 years.	1
	when langdon arrives at the venue, no one is there and no one knows about such a scheduled lecture.	1
	at the same time a diminutive cia operative pops on the scene.	1
	and yes there is an object with unknown symbols.	1
	all this starts langdon on a search for his friend, the meaning of the object and its symbols; all having to do with the masons.	1
	okay so far.	1
	but then it goes to pot in a short time.	1
	author brown has done well with giving the reader a touch of the mystical and spooky symbolism in the da vinci code, and he carries it into the lost symbol.	1
	unfortunately he bogs down in all this to the point that you want to say, 'who cares?'	1
	in this novel, brown is like the guy who when asked the time tells you how to build a watch.	1
	meanwhile the story gets side tracked while we are pummeled with masonic legend, lore, mysticism, truth, fiction ad nauseam.	1
	add to this morass of information that isn't all that important to the story a tattooed murderous lunatic and you begin to wonder just what the story is about.	1
	by mid book, you're completely lost as to what the story is because brown drifts away from the original story line to impress us with his deep knowledge of masonic history and symbolic meanings.	1
	it's as if he's writing a dissertation for his doctorate.	1
	this reviewer also got lost in the erratic flashbacks and disjointed flow (if there was one) of the story.	1
	having been a dan brown fan from the beginning, the lost symbol accomplished one thing: it totally lost me in the quagmire of symbolism and boring information that had little if any relation to the story.	1
	all the hype, mystery and entertainment style promotion can't redeem the novel.	1
	perhaps it was necessary to make up for its lack of quality.	1
	i wouldn't recommend spending money for this book.	1
	wait for it to come out on cliffs notes.    	1
	not good.this was just one bad read, most of the story you could skip right through.	1
	the story itself was unbelievable and the characters just as bad.	1
	expect much bigger things from dan brown.        	1
	boring!	1
	i want my money back!!!	1
	!.this is one of the most boring books i' m trying to read.....yes 'trying to read'.	1
	this will be the last dan brown book i will buy.	1
	now i know why it was kept so secret before the release, it stinks.        	1
	what do you people expect?.this book is a great dan brown book.	1
	no you are not going to get dynamic characters.	1
	but you be exposed to very interesting trivia that will make you write down stuff to google later on as well as the need to read just one more chapter.	1
	it is written in the same style and voice as the da vinci code.	1
	it is more sinister and it may be a little more interesting too.	1
	it has a good message and it makes you think.	1
	if you are a literary snob, i would advise that you go reread some shakespeare.	1
	this is dan brown, contemporary writer of imaginative thrillers, and for what he does, he is very good at it and this book is a good example of that.      	1
	lost author.mr.	1
	dan brown,  this would have became an amazing book only if you understood the taste of your authors.	1
	it lies in understanding how you decode the hidden messages in famous structures and messages with some interesting events in background.	1
	it does not lie in reading horrific descriptions of how someone feals when he is getting killed.	1
	you spent 3 pages describing how lingdon felt when he drowning or the way others were killed.	1
	i loved your other two books, this book had a potential to be a good book, but .........  can i get refund of money i wasted on this book?  	1
	the lost symbol.the lost symbol was an interesting read.	1
	the plot centers around the masons and the secrets they protect through symbolism and ritual.	1
	the plot progresses with the usual pacing and suspense of a dan brown novel.	1
	i like that it was set in washington d.c. many of the featured landmarks i see on a daily basis, since i work in the area.like his other four novels, this book is very vocal about organized religion and about science.	1
	i feel this hurt the momentum of the plot in places.	1
	the 'theology' brown presents in this story could be summed up as: 'man is god.'	1
	many people of faith are not going to like what they read in that regard.	1
	the story and setting i give five stars.	1
	the anti-religion message i give one star.	1
	the combined and averaged rating overall for the book i give three stars.      	1
	"real dreck.main entry: dreck variant(s): also drek   \drek\function: nounetymology: yiddish drek & german dreck, from middle high german drec; akin to old english threax rubbish      "	1
	completely immersed in readying lost symbol.i had read dan brown's other best-sellers practically straight through and this book was just as intriguing as the others.	1
	i love how he just grabs you at the beginning and weaves the storylines throughout.	1
	i'm a bit skeptical of some of the 'facts' but loved reading how the weight of the body changes soon after death....yes!!!	1
	i didn't want it to end and look forward to the movie.      	1
	from a mason's perspective.i bought this book for my husband who is a mason and a shriner.	1
	he really enjoyedthe book and now i am reading it.	1
	dan brown went to great lenghts to understandmasonic ritual and he really explored washington, d.c.  in many of the europeancountries hundreds of years ago, the masons had to go underground as they were hunted and killed for being a mason.	1
	masons are not a secret society and any man who joins will find that out.	1
	dan brown has woven a great story, and even though i have not finished the book, everyone should read this book.	1
	it is filled with a greater understanding of howwashington, d.c. was built and gives everyone a closer look at our forefathers.it is because of them that this country became so great.	1
	and as most people knowmany of them were masons, and because of their principals, we became a great democracy.      	1
	my new favorite!.i am such a fan of davinci code and angels and demons.	1
	i did not think the lost symbol would be able to live up to the thrill of its predecessors.	1
	i was wrong.	1
	the lost symbol has become my new favorite and i am ready to book a flight to d.c.!!	1
	a great read - dan brown's writing is truly sublime!	1
	!       	1
	boring.even though i am fan of the author and the intriguing ideas in this book i am annoyed that the author did not follow the first rule of good fiction: show, don't tell.	1
	how could such fascinating ideas be so boring?      	1
	america, watch out!.dan brown's claim to fame was with a little book, which you may have heard of, called .	1
	it's a tale of robert langdon, a symbologist who gets lured into an international mystery of the highest order.	1
	it was a flight of fancy, and great fun.	1
	after having read other follow up novels by successful authors, and being greatly disappointed, i was wonderfully enchanted by dan brown's newest langdon tome, 'the lost symbol'.	1
	certianly, this book will equal, if not surpass, the da vinci code, in popularity, simply because being set in america gives it an immediate influence.	1
	robert langdon hooks up with a new female counterpart in the book, dr. katharine solomon.	1
	like the other two books, expect that the characters aren't really richly drawn, but more, caught up in the surprisingly fun and intrguing mysteries hidden in our nation's capital of washington dc.	1
	the freemasons, of which i know very little, but the masons had a unique role to play in the founding of our country (many founders were masons), are explored in this book.	1
	like the whole 'holy grail' phenomenon created by 'the da vinci code', i think that people, after getting their hands on this book, will be equally as intrigued with them.	1
	i can see many people standing with books in hand, walking around the buildings of dc trying to find said symbols.	1
	at any rate, the story is sometimes fantastical, sometimes outrageous, and always a page turner.	1
	i have to give brown credit.	1
	he knows how to write a story.	1
	what made me groan a bit in his other books made me groan a bit here (especially in the much too clearly drawn characterizations) but still, it's an adventure story, written to entertain.	1
	and entertained i was!      	1
	how dan's the lost symbol was created.wow !	1
	could this book have worse.	1
	it was outrageously horrible.	1
	i have my own theory about creation of this novel.	1
	dan and his publisher decided to write a new thriller.	1
	they found a secret way to do this.	1
	they created a secret chamber inside publisher building.	1
	in that building they designed and installed a secret blender with mystic symbols on it.	1
	they put 'deception point' and 'the vinci code' for 13 days while the blender was rotating at an angle of 33 degree.	1
	after 13 days, a old secret ritual are performed and video shooting was done with high iso setting so that the final video is grainy with muffled voices.	1
	after the ritual the publisher's staff who were wearing pure white cloth created out of baby rabbit fur applied special chemical to the blended papers inside the belnder and poured the content inside a machine which was created by technologies used by cia to create a 509 pages and they binded that book in pure black hard cover and publisher and dan were astonished to see that book.	1
	since they lost many symbols from the the davinci code book in blender they called this book as the 'the lost symbol' i read all books by dan, i liked all of them but this one.	1
	i mean it was horrible read.	1
	i am also sad by the sold out reviwers of print media whose reviews appear on back of this book      	1
	do yourself a favor - skip this book.i loved da vinci code and enjoyed deception point & angels and demons.	1
	this book is...a failure.	1
	there are 2 crater-sized holes with this novel: (1)  i'm sure you're already aware that the basis of the this book is about an ancient mysteries that the freemasons have been guarding and hiding in washington dc for centuries.	1
	it's a secret so powerful that it can change mankind...or destroy it.	1
	the secret had been protected by the egyptians, sir isaac newton et al, a secret college in england (list goes on and on) and in our current time by the freemasons.	1
	the freemasons went to elaborate length to protect and hide it for generations.	1
	...so what is this secret?	1
	what is this lost symbol?	1
	well, i won't spill the beans, but this secret is something very well-known to all of us, and something many of us use daily.	1
	yup.	1
	it's such a dangerous secret that it's *hidden* right in the open.	1
	stupid, stupid, stupid plot.	1
	i felt throughly robbed when this 'secret' was revealed.	1
	(2)  this lost symbol is supposed to transcend human thinking, philosophy, science and religion -- transcend them all!	1
	but when this secret was revealed, it is very faith-specific -- it applies to one and only one faith.	1
	again, what happened to this being all-encompassing?	1
	my advice if you want to read this book -- wait until it shows up at goodwill.      	1
	not only bad, but with commercials, too.on top of all the other excellent reviews of this poor book, add questionable product mentions.	1
	chapter 1 is only 3.5 pages and there are five name-brand identifications of products.	1
	on page 1, there are mentions of an otis elevator and a falcon 2000ex corporate jet with pratt & whitney engines.	1
	and, langdon, wearing a harris tweed jacket, is picked up a lincoln town car .	1
	the books has many other mentions, few of which serve any real purpose to the plot or even the visual context of a scene.	1
	the effect is commercialization, even though i doubt it was intended to benefit brown directly.      	1
	doesn't have the magic of dvc!.boy, am i dissapointed!	1
	this book lacks the magic of dvc - and quite frankly, i expected more from a novel that took six years to write.	1
	the tale is boring, tedious and repetitive.	1
	i don't think this book will sell nearly as many copies worldwide that dvc sold, because it's just not that appealing.	1
	i'm po'd that i spent the $$ on it,instead of borrowing it.	1
	the graphic violence and twisted mentality of the villian was just over-the-top, and completely unnecessary.	1
	the ability for langdon and the solomons to survive the torture they endured became just plain silly!	1
	the last 1/3 of the book dragged on, and the entire text should have been edited better, more specifically by about 200 pages!	1
	!        	1
	dan hits the mark again!.this novel was everything i expected: an exciting, fast-paced, page turner with numerous plot twists.	1
	it follows a writing pattern similar to brown's other novels, and that's a good thing.	1
	i absolutely love the writing style of his other novels, and expected his new book to follow a similar format.	1
	what would anyone else expect?	1
	before the lost symbol was released, it was known that robert langdon was going to be the central character, and the storyline would revolve around codes, symbols etc.	1
	these are obviously the types of topics that db knows well, and is able to weave into a very captivating story....which he has done yet again.	1
	keep up the good work dan!        	1
	don't waste your time.possibly one of the worst books i have read in years.	1
	the first books were entertaining.	1
	this one falls short on every measure.   	1
	dreadful!.incredible that mr. brown continues to churn out this trash.	1
	this is the worst yet.	1
	not worthy of the name &#34;novel.&#34; and to think this'll be the most popular novel in the country, probably for months.	1
	truly depressing.      	1
	hopeless.another page turner.	1
	but mr brown must have failed his world religions class and appears to have neglected reading the bible in its original languages.	1
	there are many exegetical mistakes in his biblical quotes.	1
	this one should upset those of many faiths... but that is what sells thse things isn't it.      	1
	a thiller with a spiritual twist.for a few weeks i staunchly resisted opening the lost symbol because i had other books claiming my attention.	1
	two days ago i cracked it open and was immediately sucked into the world of dan brown, emerging bleary-eyed and contemplative.	1
	while many elements echoed the da vinci code - reluctant hero, damsel in distress, fanatic villain, wise mentor, ancient secrets - they are such archetypes that brown can be forgiven for the resonance.	1
	he really is a master storyteller who weaves history, suspense and arcana into a fairly compulsive page-turner full of adrenalin rushing action, and a labyrinth of unexpected twists and turns.	1
	the dialogue can get a bit forced on occasion, especially when presenting paragraphs of obscure factoids, and i did find myself skimming a bit.	1
	but this is first and foremost a thriller, and since i don't want to give away the plot, i'll focus on what might be the impact of the lost symbol.	1
	like good art and literature generally, i think this book both reflects and will affect the collective psyche.	1
	it taps into the same profound yearnings to understand life's mysteries that rocketed the secret to popularity a few years ago.	1
	it dangles the notion that there are indeed answers out there that 'they' (government, illuminati, the church, anyone in power, etc.)	1
	are keeping from us - grist for the mill of our inner conspiracy theorist.	1
	his research is exhaustive and meticulous, and i noticed that there are already three 'guides' to the book out there or on the way.	1
	the book can be read on several different levels: as a jolly good read, as pop history, as a popularized introduction to esoteric ideas, and/or as a big wake-up call.	1
	i'm not sure it will have the same impact as the da vinci code, because the conclusions are more personal and require reflection.	1
	the ending straddles the border between magic and plausible possibility, between victimhood and the dazzling power of creation.	1
	i recall the immortal words of pogo, 'we have met the enemy, and they are us...' the lost symbol would suggest, 'we have met god, and god is us...' let's hope this work is a self-fulfilling prophecy.	1
	awesome book except for all the philosophy after the plot has been resolved.i zipped through this one!	1
	but the author definitely was trying to convince the reader of some philosophical perspective; i don't know what becausei skipped through the last 50 pages or so once the plot had been resolved.      	1
	i pretty much like this book!.first off, let me say this book is pretty heavy which is good in a lot of ways.	1
	heavy books can be useful in many respects including, but not limited to:  smashing flies, holding down stuff in a windy room, building mini stonehenge replicas, and trapping a pet hermit crab in the corner when vacuuming.	1
	this book has other uses not related to its heaviness.	1
	one particularly useful trait of this book is that is a good coaster for many types of beverages, including but not limited to:  coffee, crystal light, juice, and sarsaparilla.	1
	based upon personal experience i do not recommend this book for holding milk.	1
	finally, i like this book because it looks very respectable on my new book shelf.	1
	i just bought furniture best described as burnt tangerine in color.	1
	until i received this book, i hadn't found any literature that matched my new color scheme without unnecessary clash.	1
	this stylish book has now made my shelving the envy of all my friends.	1
	in conclusion, i would highly recommend this book to anyone.	1
	i think this book is the equivalent of a swiss army knife in its many uses.	1
	if it were not for the foul milk smell coming from this books interior, i would have given this book five stars.	1
	i hope you have found this review helpful.	1
	love, ty      	1
	white knuckle page turner!.six years and a million conspiracy theories later, dan brown finally gives us his new novel, 'the lost symbol.'	1
	as with 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons,' the plot revolves around rare symbologist robert langdon.	1
	noetic scientist katherine soloman accompanies langdon as they chase ancient and mystical powers around washington, d.c.  as with a number of brown's novels, there is a lone antagonist who seeks these treasures as well.	1
	mal'akh, a self-tattooed beast of a human, tortures and kills the innocent as he hunts for the final piece to his personal transformation.	1
	he turns out to be the most evil and intricate villain that brown has ever presented.	1
	the novel starts with langdon flying to d.c. to present a lecture at the invitation of his mentor and friend peter soloman.	1
	however, when langdon shows up to give his presentation, he realizes something is terribly wrong.	1
	then we are taken on a fantastic trek that takes us deep into the very roots on which this country was founded.	1
	with each chapter we are taken to a different location of the action.	1
	in one particular scene, we are shown two different vantage points of what is occurring, which turns out to be extremely terrifying.	1
	in one viewpoint we see ms. soloman stumbling around in a massive pitch-black structure trying to escape her pursuer, mal'akh.	1
	then with the next chapter, we are taken into the mind of this devil as he attempts to capture ms. soloman and perform unspeakable acts against her.	1
	the societies portrayed are the freemasons (led by mr. soloman), like the knights templar in 'the davinci code' and the illuminati in 'angels and demons.'	1
	brown shows particular kindness towards them and explains they are misunderstood only because of the secretive nature of the society's members.	1
	twists and turns fill this novel, as much as the use of italicized words.	1
	this proved annoying at times, to the point where i began counting how many italic words there were per chapter.	1
	maybe it was for those who needed guidance, but i believe any sane person would have understood words like 'within' and 'staircase.'	1
	one particular aspect that makes brown's novel interesting are the various landmarks used ranging from the capitol building to the washington monument, which are used to demonstrate langdon and his female counterpart's aptitude for interpreting signs and symbols that our forefathers plastered on every structure in our nation's capitol.	1
	each facet of the landmark came with an extensive explanation or argument that proved tiresome at times.	1
	but that is what i have come to expect from professor langdon.	1
	it can be said that many of brown's novels are similar.	1
	this is, in my belief, brown's main pitfall as a novelist.	1
	predictability of actions, moments and ideas caused me to realize the final irony of the whole adventure while only halfway through the book.	1
	still, it was the means of getting there that make this his best piece of work to date. 	1
	and the magic work is tuna fish!.spoiler alertoh please!	1
	they are worried about a video getting out??	1
	doesn't dan watch history channel?	1
	that's all they show for god's sake!	1
	and i figured out that it was his son after the robbery--poor telegraphing.	1
	sorry but getting through this was like laying a five pound turd.	1
	davinci code was much better.      	1
	still an entertaining read....my favorite book of brown's is angels and demons, and it still is.	1
	when i opened this book, within the first few pages, i was concerned.	1
	what concerned me?	1
	that this novel was written like a movie script.	1
	some of the way brown describes people's reactions and actions sounded like something straight out of a script.	1
	but i continued to read on, and frankly, i was highly entertained.	1
	i loved the suspense, the campy-ness of the characters and really didn't take it that seriously.	1
	the theories, whether based in fact or fiction, were interesting.	1
	i really couldn't put it down.	1
	i still gave the book 4 stars because it did what i expected it would - gave me an entertaining, suspenseful read.	1
	could it have used more work and polish?	1
	absolutely.	1
	if you are looking for a great literary work, this isn't it.	1
	but if you are looking for a work of fiction that is altogether fun, this is it.	1
	don't read into it more than you should.      	1
	the lost symbol - alabamabookworm's opinion.	1
	[[asin:0385504225 the lost symbol what led you to pick up this book?	1
	i have seen the advertisements for months and have been looking forward to it.	1
	i have liked dan brown's other books featuring robert langdon, so i figured this one would be good too.	1
	what did you like least?	1
	there was nothing i really disliked about the book.	1
	the action did seem a little jumpier and did not seem to flow as smooth as in the previous books, but it did not lessen my enjoyment.	1
	have you read any other books by this author?	1
	what did you think of those books?	1
	i have read both of the other books by dan brown that feature robert langdon.	1
	i have enjoyed all of them.	1
	i love the puzzle solving and the trail that leads the characters from clue to clue to solve the crisis.	1
	what did you think of the main character?	1
	i love robert langdon.	1
	he is exactly like one of the professors i wish i had had in college.	1
	what about the ending?	1
	i do think the ending was a little anti-climatic.	1
	this adventure did not seem as involved as in brown's other books.	1
	i was just wishing for a grander solution than we got.	1
	all in all, i liked the book.	1
	the characters were very well-written and developed.	1
	everyone seemed believable.	1
	i loved cia inspector soto.	1
	robert langdon was great, as usual.	1
	his sidekick.	1
	katherine solomon, is good and solid - but i liked sophie from the davinci code better.	1
	i do recommend the book if you have liked dan brown's previous works, but i would wait for the less expensive paperback. 	1
	an exciting page turner and history lesson on freemasonry, washington dc & noetic science.	1
	'the lost symbol' is another fast paced intellectual rollercoaster through the world of symbology with harvard professor robert langdon in the front car.	1
	there are many similarities between this book and each of his previous books as there is a thriller-type chase for hidden/lost information with codes and puzzles leading langdon to the next step.	1
	as with the others, there is a clearly defined villian who keeps the reader at the edge of his seat, fearful that evil will prevail.	1
	as a thriller, this book accomplishes the goal of creating suspense, challenging the reader's expectations, and making it difficult for the reader to put the book down (or making it imperitive to get back to the book!).	1
	however, this book is bogged down at various times by the intellectual lectures of langdon and other characters versed in masonic history or the pseudo-religious/historical psychotic ramblings of the villian.	1
	these parts slowed down the story and i found myself, as the reader, skimming through a bit, trying to keep up with the main historical points but racing forward to the action.	1
	seriously, this book could have used a lot of editing, cutting out whole sections of religious/philosophical discussion and preaching?	1
	about the lost meaning of the bible.	1
	it appeared that brown had an agenda in mind about how those who have focused on the literal translation of the bible have been lost to see the gestalt of god's intentions.	1
	anyhow, the book is definately worth reading and no doubt will make a fun and interesting movie, as it takes place entirely in washington dc, incorporates many of the historical monuments and buildings, and leaves the reader more knowledgable about the history and integrated perspectives of the masons and founding fathers of the united states.      	1
	dan brown meets neal donald walsh.lots of differing views and ideas here about this book.	1
	i'll throw this out.	1
	my wife and i have been readers of neal donald walsh and his 'conversations with god' series.	1
	i was thinking early on that - yeah, this ties in a bit - and then wham!	1
	talk about bringing it all together - dan does an excellent job of that in this book.	1
	if you are the least bit intrigued by what you've read in this book - especially regarding the human soul - then go read some walsh.	1
	oh, and one reason why langdon would never actually be a mason is quite simple - he's catholic.	1
	as a society with secrets (as opposed to a secret society, as he points out so eloquently) - the confessional would require him to divulge what was revealed unto him.	1
	i was also quite prepared for this book to be another one of those anti-masonic type of stories.	1
	i was quite pleased with the way he treated the organization.	1
	and it's pretty much an open secret now the way parts of the rituals are performed, with some variations in each state, since each state has its own grand lodge.	1
	there's quite enough that is recognizable and part of open knowledge now that certainly was hidden in the past.	1
	as for the people who complained that many of the plot elements were rehashed from other authors or from movies - i have to ask if you actually read the book with an open mind to begin with, or were looking to pick nits throughout the entire book?	1
	the ending here was perhaps not as funny as sophie checking the water - but it still fit with the theme.	1
	you get a book that is a lot of exposition - you're going to have that.	1
	perhaps now langdon will settle down with one of the females he's run across - it would be interesting to see what someone with the knowledge of symbology that he has could do with the knowledge that katherine solomon has if they worked together.	1
	and lastly - think back, to robert a. heinlein and his character valentine michael smith - 'thou art god'.      	1
	a good read.dan brown's new book 'the lost symbol' is actually a very good read.	1
	no, it isn't as good as angels & demons or the davinci code, but it is a good book on it's own.	1
	i did have a few problems with how the main character (rl) reacted.	1
	after reading about him in the previous two books, i had an expectation of how rl would react or assimilate information.	1
	it was annoying that he had such a closed mind after his other adventures.	1
	i might be the only person willing to admit it, but i did not guess the villian's true idenity.	1
	maybe i just fell into brown's trap...usually i'm the first person to know whodoneit.	1
	and the drowning scene suprised me.	1
	of course, i did know what was happening but it still suprised me.	1
	so would i pay full price for the lost symbol?	1
	nope.	1
	but i bought it on my kindle, so i only paid $10.	1
	it's definitely worth $10!!	1
	!      	1
	didn't i read this already?	1
	didn't i see this movie already?.oh, dan brown wrote the other two langdon books, and it was a nicholas cage movie where people were rushing around d.c. looking for clues.	1
	all the expositional science read like michael crichton, and the short chapter read like james patterson.	1
	and the masons have something to do with it?	1
	read that before also.	1
	regardless, it took me only a few days to read this book (even with taking time out to devour the golden city since that was a library book).	1
	dan brown has become a franchise like james bond; you know exactly what kind of villains there will be, you know that q will give james all sorts of cool doohickeys, and you know that james bond will sort it all out without stirring his martini.	1
	and that you will enjoy it no matter how cheesy.	1
	this book got the four stars because it was just what i expected, and i still enjoyed the heck out of it.      	1
	tremendously exciting reading!.great story - i couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was next through the whole book.	1
	if you loved da vinci code and angels and demons, you're going to love this book too.	1
	i didn't give it 5 stars because the story form was just like da vinci code and angels.	1
	for instance, a crime has been committed, call robert langdon - there is an object with a code that must be deciphered.	1
	secondly, the character of cia director sato was not believable when she was first introduced.	1
	for example, when a crime is committed, i couldn't believe she kept asking langdon about symbolism for quite a few pages, before investigating the crime or national security issues.	1
	but, the character gets back on track and an exciting story continues.	1
	don't let any of this discourage you from reading or buying the book.	1
	the suspense is so good you can't put the book down.      	1
	fun.while many have said that this book was redundant of brown's other infamous robert langdon books, you have to keep in mind that he has developed a very successful formula for his conspiracy theory thrillers.	1
	the overall structure is similar to his prior novels, but the subject of the freemasons is a departure from the more controversial topics previously addressed.	1
	i have a bit more appreciation for the european settings, but the depiction of washington dc was very enlightening in its architectural, historical and symbolic descriptions.	1
	the novel is well paced and the suspense is very well done.	1
	the ending was somewhat anticlimactic, but i liked the issues of science and the power of the human mind that were addressed.	1
	if you take it at face value and enjoy the ride, it is a fun book.      	1
	intriguing, though familiar..dan brown needs to try something new.	1
	the other two robert langdon books follow the same formula, and i felt a little cheated at the end of 'symbol.'	1
	i figured out the big plot twist almost as soon as i met the villain, though at least brown doesn't cheat in that regard.	1
	overall, i had a hard time putting the book down, though i hope brown's next book is a little less familiar.	1
	i'm tired of reading the same book over and over.      	1
	thank you.my niece asked me to order this for a friend for christmas.	1
	it was a last minute thing so i didn't think we would get it in time, but we did.	1
	i hope her friend liked it, but we were pleased with the quick delivery.      	1
	great value for a great price.i received the book exactly as it said in the description.	1
	i recommend this seller.      	1
	fascinating truths woven into a page-turner.dan brown's greatest talent lies in his being able to mystify, and often amaze, the reader with true facts that are puzzle pieces that fit together in the most astounding ways.	1
	no one else can do this like brown can.	1
	the characters are interesting and the action never lets up.	1
	actually sometimes i wished it did so we could see more into the hearts of the characters.	1
	everyone at work had read this book or was reading this book when i was.	1
	often someone would walk by, tap the cover and say, 'good book'.	1
	i think that says it all.        	1
	great book with great suspence!.i first read angels amd demons and loved it.	1
	i went on and read the da vinci code.	1
	i loved that one too!	1
	now the lost symbol came out and it is just awsome!	1
	go dan brown!!	1
	!      	1
	dan brown delivers.very good book.	1
	hard to put down.	1
	not quite as good as angels and demons but still better than most books.      	1
	recipient.i ordered this book on the 15th of december, waited for the package to arrive, but didn't recieve anything.	1
	i inquired the sender about the package, but didn't recieve a response.      	1
	great read.great read.	1
	dan i cannot for your next novel in this series.	1
	everyone pick up my new novel eyes of the dead by jennifer n. fields.	1
	just type the name of my novel eyes of the dead by jennifer n. fields into the search engine at the top of this and pick it up.	1
	great novel the lost symbol a must read for any robert langdon fan  jennifer n. fields       	1
	a great weekend read.this is a wonderful read.	1
	just like the other two.	1
	i thought it is a new favorite of the three.       	1
	another fantastic book!.dan brown has yet again created a work of art that makes the reader really think... fantastic!      	1
	a bit disappointed.this is the first time that i ordered a 'new' book, and was a bit disappointed.	1
	the pages were not attached to the binding of the book, they were completely detached, which made the covers very floppy.	1
	in addition, there were quite a few pages with ink spots on them.	1
	if i didn't know better, i think they seller tried to pass of a 'used' item as a 'new' one.	1
	i will not be purchasing from this seller again.      	1
	sales.the sales say it all!	1
	over six million copies in less than three months...... now that's a review that any author would like.	1
	great book... all his books are great.	1
	take a look at his website especially the section marked 'secrets'....very interesting and amazing facts about our strange world.	1
	[...]      	1
	thought provoking, masterful work!.whenever a book is written that 'supposedly' challenges our beliefs, i look forward to reading it.	1
	if what we think is what we are, a book that challenges our beliefs will either help us transform and self actualize, or will reaffirm that what we believe is indeed a certainty for us.	1
	at any rate... we gain from the author's insight, perspective, ideas, suggestions and knowledge.	1
	so, when the da vinci code and angels & demons were released, i read them, and honestly enjoyed the mystery, the thrill, the suspense and the locations covered by the work of dan brown because having visited those cities, i was stunned to realize i had not seen many of the symbols mentioned.	1
	we even researched the last supper by leonardo davinci and were surprised to find many of the details explained by the author and never had we seen the details as when explained by this amazing writer.	1
	so, it is with great anticipation that i looked forward to reading the lost symbol, especially knowing that this book would be written about a city we frequently visit, washington, d.c. having just finished reading it, i look forward to our next visit so we can 'map' out the sites mentioned by the book and experience the thrill of discovering it through dan brown's eyes.	1
	the lost symbol is awesome!	1
	with great trepidation every page is turned because the suspense created is simply riveting.	1
	"without revealing the plot or attempt to re-write the work, the thoughts that fascinated me and have kept me pondering on the wisdom share are as follows: -	to live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books!-	what if i told you that a thought... any tiny idea that forms in our mind... actually has mass?"	1
	"the obvious implications are, if a thought has mass, then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things toward it... taking this thought a step further, what happens if many people start focusing on the same thought?-	if enough people begin thinking the same thing, then the gravitational force of that thought becomes tangible... and it exerts actual force with the ability to effect our physical world."	1
	the first lines encourage education, reading and seeking knowledge.	1
	a truly noble idea.	1
	the second and third encourage the people of our planet earth to share information, to debate ideas, to encourage learning and to 'think' therefore... becoming citizens of a planet that can; for example, finally achieve peace!	1
	imagine all the people of earth focusing on one thing, the power of our minds to create, to do good for mankind, to leave a legacy, to transfer knowledge and insight.	1
	imagine humanity realizing the true potential of our brain power to do powerful things rather than seeing ourselves as different and separate from one another.	1
	as you read the book, take the time to research the symbols, to find clips on the locations mentioned, to ponder on the probing thoughts shared by the author.	1
	powerful... and in the end, we walk away with the feeling that there is a better way for our societies to form, through cooperation and the sharing of knowledge and ideas.	1
	yes, the lost symbol provides... hope!	1
	if you have not done so, i sincerely encourage you to read the lost symbol!   	1
	the lost symbol.this item was sent in a timely manner.	1
	it was a gift, so i did not read it.      	1
	stupid, boring and dumb.who is reading this?	1
	i admit, i got hooked on the hype - and i sort of liked davinci.	1
	but this one is such a waste of time and $$.	1
	i didn't even finish it.	1
	i couldn't care less how it ends.just so you know.      	1
	don't waste your time.the book is so bad it doesn't even deserve a review.	1
	please save yourself us$ 13.00 and a lot of frustration!	1
	dan brown is as lost as his symbol in this book!      	1
	the movie national treasure was already made.like many people who bought this book, i did so because i had enjoyed the davinci code so much.	1
	now i wish i hadn't wasted my money or time.	1
	the writing, editing and character development are all the sort of thing any real professor would give a freshman a 'd' for.	1
	batman & robin's 1960s script writers came up with more compelling and believeable dialog than dan brown has tossed off here.	1
	dan brown is looking like a one-hit wonder.	1
	at least the davinci code was thought provoking.	1
	the lost symbol is nothing but a bit of cashing in on fame.	1
	somewhere the editors and publishers know this, and they don't care.	1
	just 'gimme the money'.      	1
	be careful from whom you order this.in a move of foolishly being thrifty, i opted for one of the less expensive book sellers on amazon to send me this best seller.	1
	the low price came with a long delivery time estimate.	1
	finally, when the delivery date came, i contacted the company through amazon and quickly got a refund.	1
	however, i have still not read the book!	1
	i think this experience may make me a candidate for a kindle!	1
	!      	1
	please know what i bought.hi, i don't think you realize how many screens i had to go through to write this recommendation.	1
	the main thing that i want you to understand is that even though i purchased the book on amazon, you seem to have no idea.	1
	you continue recommending it to me.	1
	could you please stop recommending items i have already purchased on amazon?	1
	thanks!      	1
	the lost symbol.having read all of dan browns previous thrillers this book lived up to his outstanding writing that makes you not want to put the book down.	1
	outstanding.        	1
	good service.i was so eager and excited to see the new book of dan brown.	1
	book it from amazon and think i might have to wait because it is hot one now.	1
	however, i experienced a very good service.	1
	delivery on time.	1
	and of course, nice book, interesting story.       	1
	dan brown's best book!.the lost symbol is a great book and dan brown a great storyteller.	1
	the very moment you start reading, you soon realizes you can't stop anymore.	1
	the book is a real page-turner enriched with an enormous ammount of historical information,a devilish vilain and it has also lots of action.	1
	if you liked other dan's books, you are going to love this one.	1
	i highly recomend!!	1
	!      	1
	can't put it down!.super read, can't put it down!	1
	lots of historical facts, and for those familiar with washington, dc, you'll be surprised at what you did not know about this city!	1
	great follow-up to davinci code!      	1
	another dan brown home run.	1
	lost symbol.the book took a while to get here but when i contacted the seller she tracked the book and i received it 2 days later.	1
	it arrived in excellent condition.      	1
	finally!	1
	another story!.as a fan of dan brown's i can say that all of his books prior to this one are retellings of the same story.	1
	now with 'the lost symbol' brown has actually told another story!	1
	good job, dan!	1
	i'm not going to make a thorough review here since so many others have already done so, so i'll just end this by saying that i enjoyed this novel immensely.      	1
	best from brown to date!.it's no wonder it took dan brown so long to write this book.	1
	the meticulous research, the finely woven story line along with a deep spiritual message work intricately together to produce his best book to date.	1
	a definite re-read      	1
	simply brilliant!.brown writes a magnificent story.	1
	history, suspense, relentless action.	1
	there's occasionally an aloud 'omg!'	1
	surprise.	1
	i'm a teacher of writing & literature & he's quite simply a phenomenal story teller.	1
	brown ties every question together in a beautiful package.	1
	can't wait to see the movie!      	1
	very entertaining.since the point of most novels is to entertain, this book certainly did that.	1
	although i agree with many reviewers that it was unnecessarily long, it was a rather quick read (particularly if you speed read through the repetition.	1
	i enjoyed it.      	1
	dan brown's the lost symbol.great book!	1
	can't say enough.	1
	a must read for all you dan brown/robert langdon fans!	1
	you won't be sorry.	1
	keeps you wanting more.      	1
	my husband couldn't put it down..he stays up  late at night reading, finding it fasinating, well researched,and  compelling.	1
	i am looking forward to reading it myself.	1
	husband thinks it is better than 'the da vinci code'.	1
	i was interested in it for metaphysical reasons and my husband found it to be a hit.       	1
	lots of action, lots of detail....i've read all of dan brown's books and this one, the lost symbol, is by far the best.it has a good plot line with several unexpected twists and turns, lots of mysteries, tons of details, and plenty of suspense.	1
	it reads like an excellent fiction novel.i can't wait for the movie to come out!      	1
	superb.this book was utterly fascinating.	1
	totally enthralling and captivating.	1
	i enjoyed this book infinitley more than the divinci code.	1
	a truly great reading experience.       	1
	brownnut.one of the 2 best that brown wrote!	1
	angels and demons was the other one      	1
	the lost symboe.this book was reviting from the first page to the last.	1
	dan brown grabs your attention from the start and doesnt let go!      	1
	another fabulous book.this book, as usual per dan brown, grabs you at the first page and keeps you up at night until you finish.	1
	the characters were well developed and the surprise at the end i did not see coming.	1
	his writing is wonderful and the scenes he paints puts you in the middle of the book.      	1
	a completely addicting read.dan brown may not turn phrases in ways that make the literature-heads swoon, but c'mon, this is the most suspenseful book i have read in years!	1
	i was fact-checking throughout the book and was delighted to learn so much i didn't know about my own country's history.      	1
	lost symbols.page after page like the other two books keeps you coming back for more and it is hard to put down.	1
	i just wish it could be a little less gruesome....but still excellent.      	1
	riviting.the lost symbol was absolutely incredible.	1
	dan brown has the ability to create, mystery, suspense and history in his novels, a perfect combination.	1
	it was very difficult for me to put it down.i always feel that i have learned so much after reading his books.	1
	i can't wait for his next one.	1
	chris lane       	1
	seize the book.rush right out and seize this book before they are all gone.	1
	this is another book that will give tom hanks a great opportunity to play robert langdon.	1
	the same template includes visits to famous places, surprise insights into things about those places, puzzles that need to be solved and do in just the nick of time, and a scary bad guy that .... well.	1
	no spoilers here.	1
	the template works and the book is a page turner that keeps you from getting anything else done even though you know how it will end - much like a football game.	1
	it is a shame though that we won't be seeing anyone else besides tom hanks in the movie from the 'the da vinci code' or 'angels and demons'.	1
	robert has all sorts of connections to various groups all of whom end up in trouble because the bad guys figure they have something special.      	1
	lost symbol.it was a suspenseful and moving novel.	1
	a good read.	1
	not as good as divinci code however      	1
	a great read.i read da vinci code as well as angles and demons.	1
	dont let the length of this book scare you.	1
	while it starts slow to develop the characters, it is well worth the wait.	1
	i read it too fast and there was so much information, i am going to read it again soon.	1
	i just have too many friends that wanted to get their hands on it before my second read.      	1
	the lost symbol book on cds.	1
	the lost symbol.absolutely astounding!	1
	this book grabs you from the start and doesn't let go until you have read every page.	1
	intriguing food for thought.	1
	you don't want to miss this one.      	1
	great book!.another dan brown classic... great from start to finish... lots of facts and historical lore... i enjoyed every page.      	1
	fantastic read!	1
	!.just as good as 'the da vinci code'.	1
	great read that makes you want to devour the book in one sitting.	1
	all the twists and turns popular with dan brown.	1
	in my opinion, the violence could be toned down a little.	1
	however, it certainly gets your attention.      	1
	writes great but left me night style..i always enjoyed the way dan brown writes.	1
	the book flowed smoothly and the details mixed with facts are tremendous.	1
	i actually loved the concept of the book and felt the bad guy was one of the darkest he has created.	1
	but the ending left a feeling with me similar to watching a m. night shamalan film.	1
	the ending was not quite there.	1
	still a great read.      	1
	great read large print makes it easy on the eyes.	1
	ending letdown.another good dan brown thriller, but a weak ending.	1
	i think he lost it with a 50 page anti-climax of metaphysical ramblings.	1
	the book essentially ended with the dispatch of the antagonist.      	1
	enough already, this books is the best!.enough already with all the negative reviews, too many bitter people on amazon..let's face reality, if you are a dan brown fan (and many are) then you are going to love the lost symbol.	1
	in fact this book is more exciting than the davinci code and angels & demons!	1
	the hype for this book was unbelievable and this book was fantastic!       	1
	must read.this book picked up right where dan left off in the davinci code.	1
	once you start, you can't put it down.a must read for any avid reader.      	1
	loved every page...love d.c..with the execption of just a few pages i was in book, art and history heaven|      	1
	lost symbol.i really enjoyed this book.	1
	it was as good or better than his other books.      	1
	cynics--go read something else..loved it!	1
	there's no need to pick this apart--just enjoy it for what it is.	1
	perfect?	1
	no, but awfully good and completely engrossing.      	1
	amazing but late delivery.the puechase was great and the book was amazing.	1
	the release date delivery was late one day, due to ups mis sorting it.	1
	i was promptly refunded the shipping carges without having to ask.	1
	thak you amazon      	1
	i've just begun..i've just started reading the book, but so far it has the same feel as the da vinci code.      	1
	a page turner.wow!	1
	i just couldn't put this book down.	1
	i am amazed at how much research must have into this work.	1
	i highly recommend it.      	1
	ken ambrose.go find the ken douglas review, he has said all that needs to be said.      	1
	the lost symbol.as expected, dan brown new book is everything i wish for in one of his books, it has been a page turner and a wonderful way of seeing the city of washington and it's monuments and buildings with a new light.hope i don't have to wait to long for the next one. 	1
	very entertaining!.out of the 3 books with the main character i enjoyed this one the best.	1
	this is simply a page turner not to be missed.	1
	the action is fast based and the interest is there from page 1 to the last page.	1
	his stories bring us into a world that can exist using facts that we may not be able to prove.	1
	looking forward to the next story.      	1
	lost symbol by dan brown.i enjoyed the book from first page to the last page of the book.	1
	the book diffferent from all the movies.       	1
	dan brown's 'lost symbol:'.as expected the lost symbol was a fun read.	1
	brown draws you in with his charaters and changes subjects in a most enjoyable way.	1
	his books are always a 'can't put it down' read.	1
	when is the next book coming out?      	1
	the lost symbol.this is dan brown's best work ever, i found it riviting, didn't want to put it down, lots of twists and turns, give you new aspect on our founding fathers, facts in front, you pick the fiction.      	1
	fantastic read!.this book never fails to entertain and keeps you at the edge.	1
	i'd say just as good as the da vinci code, if not, better.	1
	a well put together story and plot.	1
	bold, exciting characters and enough detail in the plot to make it believable.	1
	for me, it was a page turner, i couldn't put it down!      	1
	i couldn't put the book down once i started reading.i thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down once i started it.	1
	i enjoyed being able to predict some events and then being completely surprised by other events.	1
	i liked the way the book ended and am now intrigued by our founding fathers, masons, and washington, d.c. architecture.	1
	i love reading a book that makes me think of things and jumpstarts yet another topic to read about.      	1
	really - $3 less than hardback?.okay, i'm not understand why the kindle book is only $3 less than a hardcover book!	1
	does it really cost only $3 to print a book?	1
	highway robbery.      	1
	a good book but give it 1 star for being a drmed copy.dan brown books are always exciting -- i enjoyed the da vinci code and angels & demons however controversial they may be.	1
	i even watched the movies based on these books.	1
	i would rate this book at 5 stars but because of kindle drm i must rate it 1 star.	1
	digital restrictions management or digital rights management as drm vendors call it restrict users freedoms and fair use rights.	1
	earlier this year (2009) amazon had a public relations nightmare when they remotely and automatically deleted george orwell's 1984 book off of kindles without the kindle owners permission.	1
	this was after amazon apparently realized they were licensed the right to sell electronic copies of the book from a company that did not have the right to license it to them.	1
	instead of just removing it from the kindle store they removed it from all kindles and one student using the book in a class who was keeping notes not only lost his copy of the book but all his notes and began suing amazon.	1
	no company should have such power -- drm needs to become socially unacceptable and some advances in making it so have fortunately already occurred.       	1
	it wasn't flawless, but fun to read.don't listen to the haters, the book worth to read.	1
	i am not saying it is flawless in every aspect, but it is a good mixture of reality and fiction (heavier on the fiction side:).       	1
	wow!.i am really surprised that the average star rating on amazon.com for this book is only three stars.	1
	i was really expecting to see at least four stars!	1
	i really loved this book and couldn't put it down.	1
	i learnt things i never knew, such as 'amen,' used in all three monotheistic religions (judaism, christianity, islam) derives from the egyptian god amon.	1
	(i really need to look deeper into that.)	1
	does a wish or a prayer have a mass?	1
	is it something that can be measured?	1
	what an interesting concept that is.	1
	this is one of the most interesting books i have read, not to mention extremely entertaining and a definite page turner.	1
	i liked this book more than the da vinci code.	1
	i like the author's simple writing, and maybe that's what many readers don't like about dan brown.	1
	he focuses more on the storyline than on developing characters.	1
	many readers didn't enjoy reading `war and peace,' for example, because the author spends much time on, you guessed it, developing his characters.	1
	i prefer a fast-paced book, packed with useful and entertaining facts, than a book that bogs the reader down with too many details.	1
	i guess at the end it all boils down to preference.	1
	no author can please all his readers.	1
	i am definitely recommending this book to all my friends, and being in the process of forming a book club, this will be our first discussion book!      	1
	worth the wait.the book is marvelous.	1
	action almost from the start.	1
	dan brown is the master of suspense and this book is well worth reading.	1
	you won't be disappointed.      	1
	same thing but different.i really do enjoy the way dan brown can be so creative in using our past as a way to explore new possibilities into what could be.	1
	how many times can the same thing happen to one man, and the same way every time?	1
	i feel the books are all written the same way, and that there needs to be some change to grasp my attention.	1
	the book is good, and i would recommend it to anyone.      	1
	lost symbol.	1
	intriguing.dan brown- the lost symbol-(hardcover)-the title made me want to read the book.	1
	once i started i couldn't put it down just when i thought i had figured out what was happening it took a turn.	1
	full of suspense,a can't put down book.      	1
	eugene's opinion.dan brown has done it again.	1
	this is even better than 'da vinci code.'	1
	what a  great read.	1
	i realize it is a novel as he states; but the descriptions and places of action (buildings, streets, interior locations) are all very familiar to this old guy!	1
	he must be a member of the organization he talks about, to know all the rituals!	1
	superior writing and amazing tension just keeps one glued to the pages.	1
	wes       	1
	dan brown's best work yet.this is a terrific book.	1
	the beginning is a little slow but when it picks up, it goes from zero to 60!	1
	i read the book in 2 days.	1
	i couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.	1
	there are unexpected twists and turns in this book that leave you gasping.	1
	he brilliantly delivers another powerful book.      	1
	expections met and explained.the 'lost symbol' was an almost impossible task to exceed what was expected of dan brown, but i am happy that he shifted gears in this book to not only entertain and surprise but also to educate more while not stimulating the mental anguish of the conspiracy buff audience.	1
	the key to my liking this book as much as i did was how it was wrapped up in the final chapters bring all the issues together and to spell out that 'so what' if our founding fathers were mason's and 'so what' if masons has strange secrets ceremonies.	1
	what was created in our country was a wonderful idea that is still evolving but most importantly that it is 'still evolving and will continue to do so' if we do not allow those who wish to say they know more of waht anything means than i do or you do.	1
	i would now like very much to be able to climb to the capital dome and see a sunrise.	1
	i now more than ever.	1
	i would like to see the view from the top of the washington monument lokking down the mall to see all of the knowledged gathered by our society through the grand visions of dear mr smithson.	1
	our country will continue to evolve and we as human being will continue to evolve only becasue we can and we are free to do so.      	1
	the lost symbol.	1
	this is an excellent book and will no doubt sell millions and many will make enquiries into the craft as a result.	1
	as an active freemason, i was pleasantly surprised to see freemasonsry explained in a generally favorable light.	1
	sure, dan brown twists a few things around a bit in order to make for a gripping story that truly is a page-turner that is very difficult to put down once you start reading it.	1
	freemasons at all levels should buy and read this book and be prepared for lots of enquiries as a result.      	1
	a great read.some of the twists are extream but i loved every one of them.	1
	a great fast paced read that was very satisfying.	1
	i loved it.      	1
	in silly fun....'this is enlightenment!	1
	it is his own brand.'	1
	the words were written on a gift card in solomon's handwriting.	1
	langdon didn't have to open the gift to figure out what was inside.	1
	he knew his friend well enough to know the answer lied within the card itself.	1
	certainly there was deeper meaning?	1
	thirteen words in enlightenment, he thought, thirteen rolls in a baker's dozen.	1
	years ago, bakers would add an extra roll as a safeguard against penalties if 12 weighed too light.	1
	a group of 13...a safeguard.	1
	but from what?!	1
	langdon's mind spun.	1
	he glanced at his mickey mouse watch.	1
	time was running out.	1
	what did this note mean?	1
	what could solomon have sent to him in this little package?	1
	certainly he could open it and have a look, and even a little shake wouldn't be beyond reason, but any clue to its contents would make for a too short a story, so he had to draw it out.	1
	think, dammit!	1
	he racked his brain trying to break the code.	1
	13...a group of 13...  and then the answer hit him.	1
	like so many times before, robert langdon had a stroke of genius!	1
	years before he had lectured about vermeer's painting, the milkmaid.	1
	the baker's dozen portrayed in the painting was not what interested him, but it was the safeguard in the painting that caught his attention.	1
	in the year the portrait was painted, kick tiles were installed around the walls as safeguards against rodents and other pests.	1
	and in this painting in particular, langdon recalled a number '5' clearly rendered on the tile behind the maid.	1
	the five had caught his attention many times in the past.	1
	certainly it was an odd figure to paint on a kick tile, but how could vermeer have know what solomon would have sent to him so many years later?	1
	is it possible, he thought, that vermeer had been enlightened?	1
	enlightenment.	1
	number 5.  this is enlightenment...this is number 5!	1
	what could all of this mean?	1
	and his own brand.	1
	certainly this was a code.	1
	langdon wiped his palms across the lapels of his tweed jacket and tried to refocus his mind.	1
	he was aflutter with the beautiful scientist he had met earlier that day, but he knew if he had any chance of ever seeing her alive again he had to figure this puzzle out.	1
	own brand.	1
	own brand.	1
	o-w-n-b-r-a-n-d.  he unscrambled the letters and stared, in awe, as his handiwork.	1
	dan brown!	1
	the enlightment was dan brown.	1
	dan brown's fifth novel!	1
	langdon recoiled, exhausted.	1
	solomon's gift was more than just a new book, it was a puzzle yearning to be solved.	1
	mission accomplished, the dashing professor thought to himself as he smiled, straightened the collar on his turtleneck and wound his mickey watch.	1
	what is your definition of a good read?.if a good read is something that makes you turn the pages, want to keep reading the book, look up items on google (noetic science for me), and make you feel for the characters, then lost symbol is a good book!	1
	will it be considered 'historically literary significant'?	1
	no.	1
	but neither was da vinci code or any other brown book.	1
	but were they entertaining, even formulaic as some others have mentioned?	1
	sure, but that is what makes the book a good read and entertaining enough to imagine a movie being made out of it.	1
	i still like angels and demons better than both lost symbol and da vinci code, but this one was difficult enough to put down and the plot intriguing.	1
	i too thought of the national treasure movie (first one) as i read it, but this was deeper and more interesting.	1
	if you like mid-50's symbologists, adventure, mystery, codes, and ultimately resolution, with a couple twists and turns along the way, then this book is for you.	1
	thanks dan for another enjoyable read!      	1
	another great book.first off i want to say that this is typical dan brown.	1
	if you're a dan brown fan then you won't be disappointed.	1
	the book was great.	1
	the research and intelligence that went into this novel was superb.	1
	i loved every second of it from start to finish.	1
	i was especially grateful that the e-book was available on the same day that the hard copy was.	1
	well done to his publishers for doing that.	1
	well done and bravo to dan brown for taking what the secret did to a whole other level.	1
	great, great job.      	1
	the lost symbol.this book was a page turner from the beginning to the end!	1
	i've read angel & demons as well as davinci code.	1
	i preferred angels & demons over the davinci code.	1
	however, this book has those two beat hands down!	1
	!      	1
	not going to drone on....i enjoyed the book.	1
	i have a hard time reading books that are scientific and lots of detail.	1
	i couldnt make it through angels and demons but i loved da vinci code.	1
	i don't remember the last time it took me 3 days to read a book!	1
	but, in the end, i did enjoy it and will suggest it to many people, as i am a librarian and people ask me!      	1
	best one yet.i find this to be one of the best brown novels yet.	1
	i have all of his books and liked them all, but i have to say i have enjoyed this one more than the others, save maybe angels & demons.	1
	it was interesting to look up all the different things in the book and research the true story behind it while reading.      	1
	over hyped and not worth the time or money.i was excited for this ro come out and extremely disappointed with thr product.	1
	it was a chore to finish.      	1
	a blockbuster's blockbuster.it seems to be a universal law that if a writer has a huge success, his succeeding book will be universally slighted, sneered at and depreciated.	1
	actually, in many ways lost symbol improves on da vinci code (which revolutionized my attitudes about christ and christianity in its present phallocentric, political incarnation).	1
	lost symbol is set in washington, dc, a city i've always seen as an oppressive network of crushing bureaucracies -- i.e., boring.	1
	but brown digs under this view to find a washington that is both extremely interesting and exceedingly strange:  washington is actually a wheel with turning spokes of influence taking us into the future or a vortex of spheres of power whirling in some kind of strange and dynamic synchronicity.	1
	the book deals with a washington in which the cia tries to save democracy (isn't this the fbi's job?	1
	), where basements and subbasements extend into levels beneath levels, a symbology of historic complexity rendered concrete with a lot of taxpayer money.	1
	the action goes from the capitol -- seen in almost surreal terms which make what for most of us is a familiar cliche new and strange -- to the library of congress to the smithsonian institution to the national cathedral, and other locales, all institutions which have been developed on a scale never yet seen in terms of architecture and collections of books, art and scientific specimens, technology, etc., that bogle the mind in terms of extent, inclusiveness, etc.	1
	the main motif, that the early federalists of note (jefferson, washington, benjamin franklin, l'enfant, etal.)	1
	were freemasons, an association not incidental to  putting together a unique form of government on the basis of a humanistic philosophy, is beautifully developed and unless you are the kind of reader who merely wants to gallop from acts of violence to gratuitous sex acts, brown's development of the importance of the freemasons, their philosophy and imprint on democracy is intensely interesting and certainly something that every history class i ever took never thought to mention, much less develop as possibly significant in the development of a deistic republic based on a meritocracy (along with the anomalies -- slaves built the capitol and the early government buildings) is left to brown to expand on and to bring into the present in the person of his female scientist who is on the cutting edge of noetic research, the next evolution of science away from the mechanistic and the materialistic and even the einsteinian view that space and time are actual facts rather than descriptions or thought-energy we use to navigate reality.	1
	this book is also extremely witty (i.e., note the many ways langdon's claustrophobia comes up!)	1
	and the characters are not undeveloped, they are simply developed as aspects of their driving motivations and ideas.	1
	brown adheres to his da vinci formula but also turns it on its head with his latest superman villain/everyman megalomaniac.	1
	robert langdon is a witty take on the usual hero of this genre.	1
	academically gifted and omniverously curious, he is also a determined naive rationalist, even while he solves a puzzle under threat of imminent death!	1
	this is a genre novel with a difference.	1
	brown has used the genre to reach a huge audience with ideas that need to be diffused now.	1
	i suppose some people will be tempted to skip the last few chapters after the denouement and the epilogue.	1
	i suggest these are the core of the book and maybe should be re-read.      	1
	a more accurate title for this book: 'the steaming pile of excrement'.it's unfair that amazon's 5-star review system doesn't allow one to rate a book with no stars.	1
	because this book deserves no stars.	1
	not only is this the worst book of the year, but of all time.      	1
	perfect!.i can't believe there are so many negative reviews of this absolutely perfect novel!	1
	it's such a page-turner, that i found myself grabbing the book if i woke up in the middle of the night, just to read one more chapter!	1
	i didn't want it to end!	1
	congrats to dan brown for yet another excellent book!	1
	it was very much worth the wait!      	1
	dan brown, you are the best researcher and story teller, bar none!!	1
	!.my subject choice says it all.my only regret is that i have to sleep and can not read this book all at once!page after page the story is deftly told and my interest never wanes.      	1
	lost symbol is a pro-bible-rant.the lost symbol is exciting, well-plotted and well-written... until the last 50 pages, which are an apologia about how we should read and believe the bible.	1
	blech.	1
	unless you are a christian believer, quit reading after the bad guy dies and let yourself believe that the lost word is the reality of a diverse, multicultural america.      	1
	waste of time and money.horrible waste of time  and money  i cannot believe after six years this is what dan brown gives to his loyal followers.	1
	very diappointing dan.      	1
	not the best but definitely not as bad as some have stated....i have been reading a lot of these reviews from others who have read this book.	1
	i disagree with almost all of them.	1
	one reviewer stated that it was 'fast paced, as the davince code was,' yet i found it very slow paced, especially at the beginning.	1
	it went on and on about why robert langdon was in d.c. and all the background on how he was called there and the relationships with peter solomon and his sister, etc., to the point that i was about ready to abandon it if it did not get more interesting and thankfully, it finally did, but took a long, rambling path to get to that point, but it wasn't all in vain and a waste of time, as the action did pick up slightly after the hand was discovered, but it still took about the entire book to get to an answer that wasn't that hard to figure out, as we all know it anyway, and i had figured it out well before the end, not everything, of course, but what the 'secret word' was, as i am sure most everyone did.	1
	i admit it is made up of many, many small chapters, as another reviewer pointed out, a couple of them just one page, and most of them anywhere from one and a half pages to three or four, very rarely any over that many pages, but hey, a chapter is just a number and can literally be ignored, they don't mean anything except to let you know that the story is going to jump to another part, with some of the other characters featured rather than the one you are currently reading about.	1
	in spite of all of this, it is an entertaining read, if it had not been, all of these negative reviewers would not have finished reading it!	1
	all the puzzles and symbols got a little tiring, but they were very interesting and are part of the plot so had to be there.	1
	and as always, with all of his books, he leaves you wondering how much is made up (fiction) and how much is really true, especially when dealing with the masons.	1
	we hear so much about the secret rites and initiations in that organization that we really don't know what the truth is about them, and my husband is a mason, has been for forty years and i still know nothing at all about what goes on at their meetings or teh initiations!	1
	of course, he denies most of the 'secrets' that this book 'tells' about them.	1
	i only know, and know it first hand, that the organization does do a lot of good works, especially where children are concerned.	1
	i know that the scottish rite hospitals does tremendous work for burn victims and without payment if necessary.	1
	they also help crippled children without payment.	1
	a nephew of my husband's family who was born crippled was taken care of for years and fitted with needed leg braces free of charge, so i cannot say anything bad about the masons and shriners.	1
	my husband is a shriner(which is just another degree of free masonry, i think) and has driven the buses that take burned children from our home state to cincinnati,oh numerous times to be treated there.	1
	as for this book by dan brown, it has been described here as not being 'great literature.'	1
	tell me, please, just what is 'great literature?	1
	'i have been reading all of my life and have read books in all genres.	1
	to be honest, i still can't answer that question accurately.	1
	i have read books that are supposed to be 'great literature' like 'war and peace' 'the quincunx'(worst, most boring book in the world, bored me to insanity almost, my recommendation: don't read it, it is lousy) 'madame bovary' and many others that some call 'great literature.'	1
	well, frankly, i don't know what is so 'great' about them, they are usually always very boring.	1
	and whether he (dan brown)is supposed to be a great writer or not, judging by the number of books he has written and how long 'the davinci code' stayed on the best seller lists, he must be doing something right and evidently people buy and read his books, so what makes him different or judged as 'not a good writer?'	1
	seems a lot of people consider him good enough to look forward to and enjoy his books.	1
	i certainly do and i liked the story he has written in this book and found it very entertaining and a really good mystery isn't that why we read a book?	1
	to be entertained and get enjoyment from reading it?	1
	i experienced both of these emotions so i consider it a 'good book!'	1
	and as for brown's writing skills, they seem as good as any other author that i have read, they tell a story and make it clear and concise through the words that are used, and what else makes a 'good writer,' pray tell?	1
	and he usually wraps it all up neatly at the end, so what more do you want?	1
	i was satisfied with 'the lost symbol' and not sorry that i have read it, in spite of the rather slow beginning.	1
	it got very interesting farther into it.	1
	is 'gone with the wind' considered 'great literature?'	1
	or does it have to be a very, very old book and boring, to be considered 'great literature?	1
	i am on a forum about great literature and it is surprising at the number of 'book snobs' on that forum who seem to think that if a book isn't old and boring or translated from some asian language, like japanese or chinese, it isn't worth reading and only 'not very intelligent' people read books that do not fall into that category.	1
	i think they are just trying to impress others with their own 'intelligence' which can be seen very plainly in their postings isn't really that great at all.	1
	they actually appear to be very unintelligent with some of their rambling postings about 'the translations' instead of being about the books and the content and the stories that the books tell.	1
	it is people like that that is constantly putting dan brown's books down.	1
	alphia d. larkins      	1
	33 degrees of separation - noetic science next focus of the masses.what consists of about 500+pages of puzzles, conspiracy theories, secret society initiations, hidden freemason knowledge and the pairing of quantum physics with the new age (or old age) theory of a universal consciousness?	1
	the new dan brown blockbuster, of course.	1
	after a successful run, or should i say chase, down the streets of rome in  and paris in ',' brown brings the action across the pond to the new world--the shining citadel that deists around the globe proudly recognize as a onetime symbol of humanity's hope for a future illuminated with the fruition of everything man could create and imagine--washington d. c.--the lost symbol.	1
	in our bipartisan political framework where the media rules and dictates what the common man desires--fame, celebrity, wealth, power, plasma tv, brand new billion dollar stadiums to celebrate the idea of a bread and circus for the 21st century--brown stands at his pulpit of mainstream popularity and delivers a bit of a profound message for the masses.	1
	pointing to the capital building and the wondrous symbology of the american capital and its environs, he chastises the last---oops!	1
	--two hundred and thirty-three years, exclaiming that the very infighting that separated mankind from its own development and caused the founding of a nation that pushed aside religious and all other differences had crept into man's thinking yet again--and a veritable stirring of the ant pile that suggests a natural formation of hierarchical beings was in desperate need to return us to our original founding principles.	1
	cleverly, as media evangelist, brown hides his own message in a carefully honed vehicle--the popular suspense novel where he lays the cornerstone of his own genre founded and perfected by him, despite the numerous unsuccessful attempts at cloning its success.	1
	the reading public reaches for and grabs this, the da vinci code school of literature like infants seeking sugar-infused formula filled with vitamins and minerals necessary for standardized growth.	1
	and grow we do, when we read brown's interesting philosophy cloaked within the conundrum of the bestselling thriller.	1
	freely, for the price of $30 usd, we follow him into the bowels beneath the rotunda and onto a magical mystery tour of arcane americana that leads to the mythical pyramid of the freemasons and perhaps to the rediscovery of ancient knowledge that will help us approximate the divinity of god.	1
	using the science of noetics as a springboard, brown discusses the connection to the universe that we, age of aquarians, have been pondering since we knew how to ponder.	1
	wonder of wonders, he deftly demonstrates the exponential power of group intention--where many minds are focused on a particular outcome, creating a phenomenal success for himself--many readers concentrated on brown's next book--and lo and behold, it was a runaway success, commanding much discussion and speculation even before it was in print.	1
	how's that for a universal consciousness changing and redefining brown's world as orchestrated by brown?	1
	brown will do for the theories purported by the institute of noetic science what he did for all those egalitarians who loved the fact that mary magdeline was the first and foremost disciple of the christ.	1
	honestly, the intense interest that brown generates in terms of his message for the masses in the language of the mainstream is close to phenomenal.	1
	he teaches.	1
	he instructs.	1
	and he gains disciples of his own that hang on his every word without the necessity of highbrow esoteric nonsense or the trill of a fancy phrase.	1
	bottom line:  this isn't great literature, but dan brown achieves the near impossible.	1
	after all the numerous imitations to the formula started in 'angels and demons' and perfected in 'the da vinci code,' in `the lost symbol,' he writes another spectacular whirlwind novel, replete with a crazed villain intent on destruction, a brilliant woman scientist that acts as sacred feminine to the protagonist professor langdon's yang, a time-sensitive drive to solve an ancient puzzle both word and numeric, the failure of which means death to an unsuspecting innocent and rings within rings of conspirators who are not quite sure which side they are on until the very last page.	1
	like the conundrums of which he writes, brown packages a message within a message that in the case of the lost symbol subtly urges america back to its roots, rising above the labyrinth of religious differences and bipartisan politics to soar above on the level of the capital dome to glimpse at its true destiny.	1
	formulaic at times predictable, with characters speaking as if they just emerged from a cave to see a light that for seconds blinds them, the lost symbol entertains and works with no need for either six nor the masonic 33 degrees of separation.	1
	recommended.diana faillace von behren'reneofc'	1
	ok read.drawn out at times and not as believable as davinci code.	1
	premise was sound and ideas thought provoking-but events too farfetched to take seriously.  	1
	don't bother - if you read one you have read them all.all i can say is if you have read one dan brown you have read them all.	1
	this isn't even worth the paper it is printed on.	1
	he has a formula and just cranks out new books.	1
	also i doubt if a harvard professor would be so athletic.      	1
	angels & demons, take 3.honestly, folks, i liked 'the da vinci code', but 'the lost symbol' just insults your intelligence.	1
	it's the same story!	1
	it's not even formulaic.	1
	it's the same story!	1
	do not give another penny to this guy -- march down to your local library and borrow the book for free, and spend your money on your kids or pay a bill or get a pedicure.      	1
	no go.would have been a better use of my money to take the family to mcdonald's...more meat.      	1
	ho-hum.don't get me wrong it's a good read, but it's really just a re-hash of the first 2 with a masonic twist.      	1
	america is a deist nation not a christian one.let's get to the actual meat of this book.	1
	america was not founded by christians at all.	1
	it was founded by freemasons who are not christians but deists.	1
	if you have read the book then you know that egyptian lore was much more important to the masons, and is seen everywhere in washington d.c., than christianity, which is not even mentioned in the book.	1
	so how in the world did all of the right wing christians come to the conclusion that america is a christian nation instead of the philosophy that at the heart of america lies religious freedom?????	1
	mottos such as 'in god we trust' were added later (1864) during the civil war.	1
	please try to read this book and capture what brown is actually saying.      	1
	philisophyfreak/danbrownfan.not as good as angels and demons, which has been my favorite out of all of his books.	1
	the end was a bit anticlimactic for me, but true to dan brown, it is filled with historical facts and accuracy about the freemasons, secret societies, symbols and our countries founding fathers, among others!	1
	a very good read.i was engrossed in it until it was finished.	1
	took me about a day.	1
	dan brown is always an intelligent read.      	1
	the best.this author is not capable of writing a bad novel.hope we dont have to wait as long for his next classic.      	1
	i love this book!.this book is so interesting with the science and symbolism.	1
	and he's got really good at suspense.	1
	every chapter ends with a cliffhanger.	1
	so many surprises!	1
	you can't put it down!	1
	and the end is so moving!      	1
	a big waste of time.rubbish.	1
	this book is simply rubbish unless you like poor writing, boring characters, greasy villians and endless (and boring) revelations.	1
	doesn't hold a candle to da vinci.	1
	but you have to hand it to him for selling millions of very bad books.	1
	he's doing something right.       	1
	a fun fast paced read, just want i wanted.while this book will never reach the cultural highs of brown's davinci code but it is just a blast to read.	1
	nothing brown ever could come out with would have pleased people chomping at the bit for another thrill ride.	1
	brown gives us another story following in the footsteps of his last two books with pretty much the came formula, and for me that works.	1
	i love his way of story telling and he's not trying to be some great growing novelist, but just out to tell a good yarn.	1
	while many people haven't complained that angels and demons has the same formula as the the divinci code (most people still think it was written after.)	1
	this time around they most likely will.	1
	i don's see an issue with it.	1
	i liked the other two and i like this one.	1
	where this one looses people i think is the fact that the subject matter is not as close to home as the davinci code.	1
	i mean we all know what the  mona lisa looks like and the last supper and we all have heard of the holy grail, but this time round we are told a tale of things not so familiar to us and for that we might get a little frustrated and it not being so 'oh my god' when we are told a strange fact about something we know.	1
	only thing i can tell you get it and make the decision for yourself.	1
	if you liked the story format and learning bits of trivia about things you'll most likely like it.       	1
	wow.i was hooked!	1
	it was a great book and db always gets you thinking and learning.      	1
	the lost symobl.top notch thriller.	1
	i had to set the book down several times to cool my overactive imagination, and would quickly pick it back up to finish.	1
	the kind of book that keeps you up all night reading.       	1
	fun facts, little heavy handed, so,so action, kindel edition has no text to speach option.although the book downloaded at midnight on release day i spent 2 days finishing kathy griffin's new book.	1
	gossip just won out.	1
	then i got to tear into the dan brown book, the symbol.	1
	although not as good at the divinci code (that is a monster to try and follow up with) i found the book intriguing, somewhat fun to read.	1
	it kept me interested enough that when i was off to an emmy party to watch the show i wanted to listen to it with the text to speach option.	1
	turns out the publisher had their issues and chose to keep this option off.	1
	(note to publisher: the text to speach will never replace a person who does a great reading.	1
	the text to speach is adequate for me to listen to for 25 minutes as i travel to a friends house.	1
	past that if i wanted to hear the whole thing i would have bought the audio version.	1
	quit feeling threatened.	1
	start looking at it as a suplimentation to the book and nothing more.).	1
	i can say i am glad i only paid $9.99 for the book though.	1
	i look forward to dan brown's next book now that he took a huge leap off the cliff of producing something after his monster hit.      	1
	great condition.i was very pleased with my pruchase.	1
	it arrived within a week of ordering it and it was is great condition.	1
	:)      	1
	wonderful book!.this is one of dan brown's best books.	1
	i could not put it down.	1
	more i need more.      	1
	great book.this is a great book.	1
	this is the first of the dan brown books i have read and i can not put it down.	1
	if you are a fan of dan brown i think you will like it.	1
	if you have never read dan brown before this i would recommend it.	1
	you may want to pick up the 'angels and demons' and 'the da vinci code' because there are references to them through out the book but it won't hurt if you have not read them.	1
	i would recommend this book highly.       	1
	booooooring and slow.this is an excellent book if what you want is to fall asleep as rapidly as possible.	1
	the story moves pathetically slow without purpose; as if the author is on a quest to fulfill a page count commitment to the publisher.	1
	tolstoy's war and peace and solzhenitsyn's doctor zhivago, were slow starters, as the authors colored in character personalities and situational awareness.	1
	ultimately, however, the full glory of the cast was realized and the magnificence of the stories became crystal clear and reader appreciated.	1
	not so with the lost symbol!	1
	it just droned on and on until finally it mercifially stumbled to a close.	1
	joel d. smithhuntington beach, ca      	1
	what the heck just happened?.the book started off and read through as what i expected from brown's two most recent novels, but the ending... such a cop out.	1
	i wouldn't recommend it as it was not worth the effort when all is said and done.	1
	brown rode on the coat tails of his earlier work.	1
	i felt tricked and played.      	1
	thrilling, entertaining, includes many things to learn.i enjoyed reading the lost symbol a lot.	1
	i couldn't stop reading especially the second half which is more thrilling.	1
	dan brown again gives quite a number of historical data which is mostly gathered again in the second part.	1
	i am very much satisfied with the conclusion as well.	1
	i think dan brown is very good at what he has to say to us through his books.	1
	i loved it.      	1
	superb!.now, i am waiting impatiently for the movie!	1
	i hope tom hanks likes the scenario!      	1
	a page turner...has kept me up a few nights!.dan brown is a super smart, engaging writer.	1
	i really enjoyed reading the book- the characters are very believable and authentic.	1
	the setting descriptions are great- having lived in dc once upon a time, it was like taking a suspenseful trip back to the district.	1
	read the book...its like nothing you've ever read before.	1
	i haven't been able to read it yet but you amazon did a wonderful job.yes the fact that i was able to buy it so easy was a great help to me.	1
	because i don't have the mobility to run to the book store.	1
	a lot of things that i buy through amazon are that way.	1
	i would have to either arrange a ride the proper store if it is even in the small town of roswell.	1
	so thank you.       	1
	brown does it again.and here i thought 'the di vinci code' was pretty good.	1
	this one has more twists and turns then a mountain highway and just when you think you have figured everything out bamm the story takes a 180. if you plan on reading this book start it on a friday because you will not be able to put it down.      	1
	suspensful and intriguing.	1
	intense, chilling.an intense, can't-put-down read.	1
	beautifully written and fantastically researched.	1
	particularly interesting to me since grandfather, father were masons, grandmother; eastern star.      	1
	good book.i was expecting more.	1
	it was good.	1
	but after having to wait so long for it i was expecting more.	1
	his other books were much better.	1
	seemed sort of predictable.      	1
	dan brown does it again!	1
	fantastic writing!.if you are fimiliar with 'a course in miracles' you will probably get many 'aha' moments like i did.	1
	well done, dan.	1
	keep up the good work.      	1
	great add on.i enjoyed it very much... i loved angels and demons while the da vinci code was not the best.	1
	the lost symbol kept my attention and i read it very quickly.	1
	my favortie of brown's is still deception point.	1
	he is my favorite author by a long stretch.      	1
	the lost symbol.	1
	sab's opinions.this book followed closely the style of dan brown's previous works, as would be expected.	1
	it kept me interested until the last 30 pages.	1
	the last chapter almost seemed anti-climactic and contrived.	1
	i was disappointed in the end.	1
	was it worth the read?	1
	yes.	1
	but not what i expected.      	1
	shipping very fast!!	1
	!.i bought this book for my girlfriend who's actually in norway and she receive it before the approximative delivery date!!	1
	awesome!	1
	thanks.      	1
	book order, very prompt and great shape.i received my book in a very timely manner and it was in perfect shape.	1
	i was shocked to get it so fast.       	1
	great book!.if you liked angels & demons and the davinci code, you will definitely like the lost symbol.	1
	i think it's the best one yet.      	1
	an amazing book!!!!	1
	!.this book is another classic by dan brown that readers will not want to put down.       	1
	the lost symbol review.this has definitely been an excellent book.	1
	not quite angels and demons but probably better the the da vinci code.	1
	i find myself reading a hundred pages of this book in no time.        	1
	the lost symbol.the book was in excellent condition.	1
	shipping was prompt.	1
	i have no regrets or any issues.	1
	i will rate this transaction excellent.      	1
	dan brown's lost symbol (unabridged auto version).	1
	a stolen idea.i think he sold himself out, in more ways then one...but he is a gifted author      	1
	exciting.i started to read this book's couple of pages around 10:30pm and i fell sleep.	1
	i thought oh, this is not good.	1
	but then the other day i just couldn't put it down.	1
	it was exciting.	1
	same dan brown twists.      	1
	i like the reader, paul michael.i think the reader, paul michael, does a very good job.	1
	this is a very important part of an audio book experience.      	1
	fan of reality based literature..this lesson in american history is a thought provoking thriller that keeps you mesmerized.	1
	a well researched story that incorpoates little known truths as the plot unfolds and brings to light some interesting topics that merit in depth considertion.       	1
	a master at weaving fascinating fact and fiction.....where the da vince code took the reader on a search for the holy grail, the hidden feminine, dan brown's latest creation takes us on a search for the lost word.	1
	we become seekers of the evolution of the soul through the ancinet mysteries of the freemasons and through noetic sciences, with this fast paced, fascinating thriller.	1
	the da vince code left us wanting more, the lost symbol satifies!       	1
	christian mysticism and the message of the lost symbol.	1
	by peter t. haas i finished dan brown's new novel the lost symbol last week.	1
	truth be told, i couldn't put it down and finished it in two days.	1
	to my taste, it is his best book yet.	1
	the texture of the antagonist's character, mal'akh, was nuanced and vivid.	1
	his mutated, hedonistic spirituality completely overshadows langdon's prosaic and professorial steadiness.	1
	like the dark night's joker, the lost symbol's mal'akh steals the show - darkly.	1
	i delighted in the plot development, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that this novel is not just about the secrets of the freemasons and the cryptic symbology in washington d.c. - as has been pushed by the book's publicity blitz.	1
	curiously, the lost symbol is also a theological story, one which articulates some of the profound insights conveyed by christian mysticism, which are now just being confirmed by science, such as the interconnectedness of reality (the trinity and the soul); the influence of intentional thought upon matter (prayer and meditation); and the transformation of human beings through wisdom into higher levels of being (salvation and theosis).	1
	it is the presence of theosis in the lost symbol that shocked me the most, not because it is a shocking idea, but because it seems that the message of the book is theosis!	1
	i was stunned that brown essentially begins and ends the novel at the apotheosis of george washington in the united states capital rotunda, a relief painting on the capital dome that brown says teaches that the freemason founding fathers wanted to convey the principle idea of the ancient mysteries - that humans can become gods!	1
	this is one version of theosis, a version whose purpose or means is not spelled out in the novel.	1
	but its mere presence is theologically provocative indeed!	1
	while the lost symbol draws upon a soup of gnostic, mystic, alchemical, astrological and ancient symbolism to spin its tale, that does not diminish the historical and generally accurate reflection of these systems of belief.	1
	the novel also delves into alternative and emerging fields of science, like noetic and consciousness studies, two fields of studies that are fascinating and keep pace with the advances of quantum and string theories at the human level.	1
	indeed, katherine, the scientific damsel in distress in the story line, offers her own unique plot development that could easily be a separate novel.	1
	her secret, scientific studies were compelling on their own, without the added drama of the spiritualistic connections driving mal'akh and entangling professor langdon, katherine and her brother solomon, the wise, open-hearted believer in the ancient mysteries, who represents the antithesis to mal'akh's own hard-hearted approach to darker mysteries of the human quest for power, spiritually or scientifically.	1
	where i found myself most delighted in the book was in the hope that such novels begin to prepare the general populous with a higher-level mindset, one that begins to open readers up to the interconnected relationality of all reality.	1
	one of the messages of the lost symbol  is that at the deepest levels, reality is ultimately spiritual.	1
	this is a bridge for religious dialogue and connects us to the ancient christian knowledge of the church fathers who sought to convey this with their very high christology articulated by st. paul in such passages as: 'that christ might be all in all' (colossians 3.11), and the luminous prayer in ephesians chapter 3, from which i quote just verses 18 - 19: 'i pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god.'	1
	and of course, we must recall here the important doxological formula in the book of romans: 'for from god and through him and to him are all things' (romans 11.36).	1
	while it was probably not brown's intention to write a systematic articulation of christian mysticism, he did include important elements of the christian tradition useful for conversation.	1
	for example, there are vast distinctions between the power of human will bent toward self-transcendence to become as gods represented by mal'akh, versus the christian self-surrender to love through a union with christ - which is the journey into theosis.	1
	theosis is an important christian doctrine rooted deeply in the christian tradition and teachings of the church fathers.	1
	while theosis has been historically neglected by the western church, roman catholic and protestant alike, the eastern orthodox church has kept this doctrine at the center of their views of salvation, and rightly so.	1
	for the church fathers, salvation was not just about 'getting saved' or 'going to heaven.'	1
	salvation was the totality of transformation of one's life in and through christ by the power of the spirit to such an extent that the fullness of what a human being could be was demonstrated by jesus the christ, not just to be worshipped as lord and savior, but to be followed, that is to say, to give one's life to god through an ever deepening union with christ by the word, sacrament and spirit so to become, in the words of the protestant c.s.	1
	lewis, little christs, or in the words of st. peter, 'that we become participants in the divine nature' (2 peter 2.4).	1
	this is the mystery of god revealed in christ.	1
	the lost symbol is a fun and fantastic read.	1
	but don't build your theology on it.	1
	let it inspire you to search the deeper truths of the christian tradition.	1
	there is much to explore to great profit.	1
	when you do, you will discover that there are two forces at work in this world: the way of gravity toward the earth, and the way of attraction to heaven.	1
	in brown's story, mal'akh represents the self-gratifying, sacrificing, will to power that is empowered by the forces of this earth, under the demonic influence of sin, death and evil.	1
	langdon, represents the self-giving, surrendering, love of wisdom and neighbor empowered by the forces of heaven, under the divine influence of life, light and love.	1
	this distinction is captured in the lord's prayer where we pray for god's kingdom not our own.	1
	and for god's will to be done, not our own.	1
	for christians, jesus christ represents light, life and love.	1
	he is the way, truth and life.	1
	jesus christ is the living relationship demonstrating that god is the relationship of relationships, whom we call father-son-holy spirit, or even being-beloved-becoming, or st. augustine's, love-loved-loving.	1
	that is, at the heart of the reality, we confess a loving interrelated, life-giving generative source whom we call father, and know through the son and partake in by the spirit.	1
	this is the spiritual life - life loving and longing and becoming god through union with christ by the spirit.	1
	it is also the source of worship and wonder.	1
	if you feel inspired to search and wonder about the deep meaning of christianity, i commend to you andrew louth's excellent and authoritative book the origins of the christian mystical tradition, or bernard mcginn's five volume opus the presence of god: a history of western christian mysticism.	1
	there are many other helpful resources also that articulate how the new science is impacting our theology such as: clestus wessels', jesus in the new universe story; ilia delio's, christ in evolution; and raimon panikkar's christophany: the fullness of man.	1
	for a useful history of consciousness studies see gary lachman's, a secret history of consciousness.	1
	and finally, for a softer approach to the christian mystic/contemplative tradition see the excellent new book by inter varsity press, longing for god by richard foster and gayle beebe.	1
	the eastern orthodox tradition is also a very rich and historical christian community to help discern the distinctions between christian spirituality and the many divergent mystical and esoteric schools.	1
	there are vast and important differences to be mindful of.	1
	some of the best work on orthodox christian spirituality is published by cistercian publications, especially the cistercian studies series, such as volume seventy-nine, the spirituality of the christian east by tomas spidlik.	1
	for those who prefer web-resources, i have found the following link especially helpful on the doctrine of theosis: [...] whatever symbols might be found in the unfolding drama of human imagination and questing for meaning, i remind the reader that jesus came to seek and to find that which was lost.	1
	indeed, jesus, as the good shepherd, seeks after the one lost sheep.	1
	when i realized that i was the lost one in need of being found, my life was transformed and i began a journey from one degree of glory to another and it continues today.	1
	every blessing in the love of god,peter t. haas[...]      	1
	rollicking roller coaster of a read.dan brown's new book, 'the lost symbol' sold one million copies the first day it hit bookshelves and on-line booksellers for a good reason.	1
	it's a fabulous roller coaster ride written by one of the most entertaining authors to have ever put a pen to paper.	1
	in addition to a smooth writing style, brown's meticulous research and unfailing attention to detail are what sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.	1
	you'd have to be living under a rock for the past several years not to be familiar with robert langdon, brown's mega-smart harvard symbologist, and the hero of 'the davinci code' and 'angels and demons.'	1
	langdon's best friend and mentor peter solomon, the wealthy scion and head of the smithsonian institute, urgently needs him to speak at a gala held every year to honor the institute's most generous donors.	1
	'the problem is this,' solomon's able assistant pleads with langdon.	1
	'our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.	1
	... this means we are desperate for a replacement speaker and mr. solomon is hoping you would consider filling in.'	1
	solomon's office sends a private plane and arranges for a limo to deliver langdon to the national statuary hall, 'the best room in all of d.c.,' for the speech.	1
	imagine langdon's surprise when he arrives at his destination and discovers he's alone in the great hall.	1
	he's led to a horrific clue in the capitol's rotunda, and thus begins a race to save his friend's life, despite interference from capitol police, the cia's top brass and a very twisted villain who will stop at nothing to realize his dark dream of unification.	1
	no spoilers here, but suffice it to say the gruesome nature of the clue haunted me long after the book ended.	1
	i kept thinking the clue wasn't real ... or wasn't really what it was ... i kept hoping it was a sick joke played on langdon by the book's bad guy, but no such luck.	1
	it was the real thing.	1
	yipes and yuck!	1
	before long, langdon's on the run, joined by solomon's sister, katherine, a noetic* scientist and director of 'the world's largest and most technologically advanced museum ... hous[ing] more pieces than the hermitage, the vatican museum, and the new york metropolitan ...	1
	combined.'	1
	langdon and katherine team up to follow clue after hidden clue, save solomon's life and stop the mad man who always seems to be one step ahead of them.	1
	their journey carries them from the capitol to the national cathedral to a mansion in the tony klaorama heights neighborhood, ending in a brutal confrontation at the house of the temple, 'the crown jewel of the masonic scottish rite in america.'	1
	once the story got rolling, brown left me no choice but to finish, even if it took until 4:30 in the morning to turn the last page.	1
	it was a rip-roaring ride.	1
	i figured out early on who the villain was and why he was driven to do what he did, but it did not distract from plot.	1
	i've never been very good at deciphering codes or solving ancient problems, but not to worry - robert langdon does all the work for me.	1
	much has been made about the use of masonic symbols in this book.	1
	while the plot is driven by masonic symbols and secrets, this is a work of fiction and reading any more into the plot means you have way too much time on your hands - at least that's how it looks from my roost in the reading room.      	1
	another great mystery thriller.i cannot believe the bad reviews i am reading about this book.	1
	for those with no sense of intrigue about the lost mysteries, the knights templar, king solomon, the free masons, lost deities, cults, bible beliefs,and mysticism combined with modern science; this book is not for you.	1
	where is your sense of intrigue?i, on the other hand, am fascinated with these subjects and constantly scour the history chanel for programs pertaining to these subjects.	1
	this is a fictional thriller.	1
	brown has woven a tale incorporating these mysteries.	1
	i couldn't put it down.	1
	want to bet there will be a 'lost symbol' tour in washington?	1
	just as there is a 'angels and demons tour' in italy.	1
	ok, tom hanks we are ready for your next robert langdon episode.	1
	dan brown - kudos's to you for writing another great story.	1
	incidentally, right after finishing this book there was a show on the history chanel called 'secrets of our founding fathers'.	1
	what a sequel to the book.	1
	just fascinating.	1
	reviewing the reviewers.the lost symbol has engaged me for 3 days and after these 3 days it's gone forever, mainly because the hidden knowlegde is superficial and does not penetrate the very core of the wisdom of the ages.	1
	the reviews have kept me busy for 3 hours to learn about american society in 2009. about 99% of the reviews are absolutely boring and tell not much of interest about the book, but a lot of the reviewers.	1
	students sociology and psychology can easily write a good essay of the great divides in contemporary america using the stars given as an entrance for their essay.       	1
	awesome.best book i have read in a long time.	1
	his best book by far because the ending was not cheasy as his other books      	1
	fantastic!.i don't know what book some of these other reviewers are reading, but the book i got was fantastic.	1
	i read the first 1/2 prior to going to washington dc with my sister.	1
	we visited all the mentioned places, followed the clues, analysed the art, and just couldn't read the book fast enought.	1
	it was fantastic.	1
	i found the ending very thoughful, and i'm still thinking about it.	1
	read the book!	1
	if you're not in dc, at least pull the images up online to make the book even more alive for you.	1
	loved it.       	1
	tommy lightfoot garrett reviewed dan brown's latest novel for canyon news.beverly hills--dan brown's 'davinci code' was followed by 'angels and demons.'	1
	already the first five million books of his novel 'the lost symbol' in hardcover is virtually sold out and surely ron howard will be putting the fascinating fictional story on film.	1
	'the lost symbol' is a brilliant and compelling thriller.	1
	dan brown's prodigious talent for storytelling, infused with history, codes and intrigue, is on full display in this new book.	1
	this is one of the most anticipated publications in recent history, and it was well worth the wait,' said sonny mehta, chairman and editor in chief of the knopf doubleday publishing group.	1
	'the lost symbol' once again features the unforgettable protagonist, robert langdon in a story that jumps off the page and rivals the previous two novels.	1
	i think this book is perhaps better than the other two because brown was able to perfect his story and i feel like i finally know robert langdon in this book.	1
	without giving the ending away, i'll say when the story begins, the harvard professor langdon, who is a symbologist is summoned to deliver an evening lecture in the u.s. capitol building.	1
	within a short period of time upon his arrival, the night takes a shocking but expected turn for the readers.	1
	langdon starts to recognize an object as an ancient invitation, one meant to usher its recipient onto a long, lost world of esoteric wisdom.	1
	not surprisingly murders ensue and the protagonist langdon is thrust into a supernatural story that follows much of the author's imagination to a stunning climax.	1
	the 500 page book is never boring and the story moves in a typical brown fast pace.	1
	this book is a must-read for dan brown fans and the theme that the books are better than the films probably will continue with this read. 	1
	the lost symbol.i am almost finished with this book and i am enjoying it very much.	1
	i have enjoyed all dan browns books.       	1
	read the book again.i can't believe the lost symbol is getting low ratings.	1
	it is an amazing book.	1
	instead of focusing too much on the fictional story, readers should pay close attention to the information weaved through it.	1
	it is important.	1
	this work can and should change the way people think.	1
	thank you, dan brown for having the guts to write about topics that will hopefully excite people to look at their religion  with new eyes, or let's hope a new mind.	1
	i found reading 'the moses code' helped me understand what dan brown is writing about, that the bible is an allegroy with rich lessons to be learned.	1
	fantastic!      	1
	this is not a good book.in the divinci code we were able to overlook the poor writing because of the enticing story.	1
	no such luck here.	1
	do not bother.      	1
	the lost symbol.i liked it a lot.	1
	its fun and fast paced.	1
	it was easy to follow and seemed genuinely authentic; as if it could really be true.	1
	good book!      	1
	great book!.while not as engaging as the previous langdon novels, this is still an excellent book.       	1
	best seller?.davinci code was simply bad, but oh, taking a shot at jesus pays off.angels and daemons was horrible literature.	1
	my 10 year old grandson could have written a better story.this book?	1
	the author should be ashamed of himself. 	1
	are you kidding me!	1
	!.come on!	1
	the same old same old.	1
	i just read a.t. nicholas' the reflection of evil and was blown away.	1
	then i get lost sysbol and feel totally let down.	1
	if you're like me, i suggest the reflection of evil by nicholas.	1
	it's the best book i've read in years.      	1
	this is an evolutionary step for humanity.i would never have guessed it but dan brown has created a master-work to rival the secret and the new earth in it's power to open humanity up to a new level of being.	1
	as you would expect, the book is a compelling thriller with all the action and suspense you could ever want, but woven within the story is an even deeper message to the world that has the potential to bring a global shift in awareness.	1
	unsuspecting readers will find themselves faced with somepowerful ideas that, if applied could mean a transformation of the indevidual toward peace and abundance.	1
	i know it sounds very esoteric, but the fact remains, once agian dan brown has challenged humanity to broaden their vision and see beyond the limited perception and beliefs to be open to a power within humanity beyond our wildest dreams.	1
	once again, dan brown has created a groundbreaking work whose transformative power even he may yet be unaware.      	1
	fantastic read.fantastic read !!!	1
	compelling, suspensful and mind opening....dan brown has really done a great job with pulling the reader in and making them beg for more.	1
	when i finished this book i took a moment to ponder the ideas he wrote about.	1
	although a fictional book, the new ways of looking at the world, education, religion and ones self truly captivated me.       	1
	another entertaining story from dan brown.if you're looking for great literature, read the classics!	1
	if you want a page turner and would like to reconnect with harvard symbologist,  robert langdon, you should enjoy the lost symbol.	1
	the story also gives an interesting look at the history and art of washington, d.c.  at 509  pages it is still a quick read!	1
	a movie version will probably be around in a couple of years.	1
	i thought it was fun to get the kindle version and read it on the day of release.	1
	also amazon kept the price reasonable at $9.99!        	1
	the worst book i've ever read..i read the lost symbol on a dare by a friend.	1
	it's not hyperbole when i say this is the worst book i've ever read.	1
	the main character, robert langdon, is whiny, annoying, and willfully stupid; the supporting characters are one-dimensional; the plot is completely implausible; and the writing is worse than i expected.	1
	bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.	1
	on the plus side, it took me all of 5 hours to read the 500+ pages.	1
	however, those 5 hours were filled with self-loathing and regret.      	1
	one heck of a ride.now boarding on track 33, the symbolism express departing for the freemasons, the invisible college, the office of security, the smsc, the institute of noetic sciences and multiple points around the cryptic compass.	1
	your temporal destination, not paris and london, but washington, d.c. your conductor, harvard symbiologist robert langdon, the indiana jones of the new age.	1
	tied to the tracks in the gathering darkness ahead and facing certain death, if not embarrassment, another keeper of the ancient mysteries including the wisdom of solomon, not a man of the louvre, but a man of the smithsonian.	1
	traveling alone, an attractive female relative of the man lashed to the tracks, not agent and cryptologist sophie neveu, but noetic scientist dr katherine solomon.	1
	sitting in the engineer's seat with a small stone pyramid rather than a chalice holding down the deadman's pedal, a rogue and tattooed mason in search of apotheosis replaces silas, 'the da vinci code's' rogue and scourged monk as our antagonist for the evening.	1
	hold on.	1
	it's going to be another bumpy ride.	1
	dreams of dj vu remind you what the journey will be like: short chapters, multiple points of view, conflicting agendas with something very large (yet unknown) at stake, the thrill of the chase, the almost-sexual tension of near-satisfaction again and again as answers appear and disappear, multiple station stops for arcane wisdom instruction, and a desperate-save-humanity-hunt for secrets you've stared at your entire life without comprehending.	1
	by the end of the novel, you won't be a 33rd degree mason and you won't be like unto a god in any way you can quite wrap your mind around, but you will have experienced a high-adrenaline ride.	1
	this thrill is what the journey is all about.	1
	perhaps reality lurks around the edge of the plot and theme and perhaps sacred messages lurk within the vast white spaces between the lines of black type, but that's not why we're turning the pages from 1 to 509. dan brown has done it again, and upon reflection at the dawn's first light, you'll see that he knows how to pull the right strings and push the right buttons and sprinkle the right esoteric seasonings across his smorgasbord of mysteries from around the world to keep readers addicted for the trip.	1
	on the last page, you may well hope, along with robert langdon and katherine solomon that men and women will follow the ancient maps toward their true potential; but seriously, the novel's destination really doesn't matter, does it, because the ride was the peak experience you were seeking when you picked up 'the lost symbol.'	1
	all aboard.	1
	now, humor aside, will 'the lost symbol' matter as much as 'the da vinci code'?	1
	no, because suggesting jesus christ was married and had a child is a much more volatile premise that suggesting the united states was created in whole or in part by freemasons and/or that it's being controlled by them now.	1
	sure, there are dozens of books out there about masons and templars, but they don't have the controversy generating spark of the holy grail and mary magdalen.	1
	if you read 'the da vinci code' more because of the controversy than the story, you may be disappointed in 'the lost symbol.'	1
	if you're considering 'the lost symbol' for the love of the chase and the symbolic puzzles, you'll probably have fun.	1
	the lost symbol.i have read this book yet but, if it is anything like the first two it will be good and can't wait to start in on this one.      	1
	sorry, but this is not a good book in any way at all.i loved da vinci code, but this is an attempt to rekindle that fire, and what it ends up with is a bunch of smoke and mirrors.	1
	once that part clears up you're at the end of the book, praying for some sense of recovery, but noooooo.	1
	it ends just as bad.	1
	i'm a very positive person, and usually find the good in most things.	1
	there's very little of that here.      	1
	another successful amazon find.my new book came for a fraction of its list price very quickly.	1
	i am so pleased with the variety available to me on amazon.      	1
	the lost symbol.excellent writing by dan brown.	1
	a real page tirner.	1
	hard to put down.      	1
	the lost symbol.i purchased the book for my father.	1
	he is a mason, and he lived and worked in washington, d. c.i knew he would enjoy reading this book.      	1
	great read and great service.i received this book even faster than i expected.	1
	it was new and arrived in excellent condition.	1

	it grabs your attention from the first page and you are hooked the whole way through.      	1
	excellent book.really enjoyed reading this book, from the first few pages till the last.	1
	the element of mystery and symbolism and great questions that have always bothered mankind were artfully interwoven in the storyline.	1
	it really got me thinking about supernaturality/ religion/science / etc.	1
	this is a must read.	1
	i also liked the fact that the vhapters are so short.      	1
	page turner.i thought a little slow getting started but his style of bringing you only so far then changing scenes, keeps you turning pages.	1
	as usual always a couple of things that don't seem probable.       	1
	lost symbol.the lost symbol was wonderful, in dan browns' style,so exciting , gripping and mysterious, i couldn't put it down.	1
	the dark passages,intrigue and the twist-- wow and of course theres the factual side that keeps you thinking once youv'e finished the novel.	1
	what's next dan ?      	1
	the lost symbol.	1

	terrific.this was a great read.	1

	i am shocked anyone doesnt like it.      	1
	couldn't put it down!.another great book by dan brown.	1
	fascinating history and amazing plot twists.	1
	wonderful food for thought, i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys thought provoking novels and suspense.      	1
	my review and read this sony: my cast suggestion for the lost symbol.what do you get when you cross puzzles, codes and riddles with the freemasons, wrapped up in a very suspenseful story?	1
	answer: the lost symbol.	1
	this is dan brown's latest book that once again features the famous robert langdon.	1
	personally, i hope that all of dan brown's future novels feature robert langdon because he is one of my ultimate heroes and i always get to learn something new in each novel.	1
	as i was reading through this novel, i immediately pictured a cast for this movie.	1
	studying each character in the novel made me immediately think of what actor or actress should play this role.	1
	in the past i have been right when i attempted this with other novels, but here is how i envision it (not a complete list): robert langdon - tom hankswarren bellamy - morgan freemankatherine solomon - mimi rogerspeter solomon - dennis quaidmal'akh - vin dieselinoue sato - (this is a hard one, but i'm sure sony can find a good one) so, this is how i see each character.	1
	i might be right.	1
	i might be wrong but you gotta admit: this is a good line-up for the lost symbol.	1
	it would make me want to see the movie even if i didn't know what the story was about.	1
	pick up a copy and read this novel!	1
	every chapter is a page-turner.	1
	you will be delighted, surprised, in awe, and shock once you read through this novel.	1
	it will definitely keep you wanting to read more!!!	1
	highly recommended      	1
	lots of fun historical facts.lots of interesting history, dan brown really researched quite a bit for this novel!	1
	while angels & demons was my favorite of the three, this one is still good for several thrills.      	1
	good story with caveats.the book really is a page turner.	1
	there is a good bit of action, mystery and suspense.	1
	the history and symbolism of the mason's is really interesting.	1
	the big annoyance was brown's interjections that seem to have the goal of making christians feel stupid for being a christian.	1
	he uses language meant to sound like fact to explain away the tenants of the christian faith, as if it is really all just one big conspiracy to control people.	1
	meanwhile he calls people like the renown satanist aliester crowley as simply being 'misunderstood'.	1
	most of these sometimes page long tangents have absolutely squat to do with the actual story and it gets annoying quickly.	1
	all in all it is a decent book, just take the side notes with a grain of salt.       	1
	an awe inspiring masterpiece of biblical proportions.	1
	the lost symbol by dan brown is an inspirational and ingenious masterpiece that shines brilliantly and uplifts mind and spirit!	1
	i savored the rich story during my spare time for more than two weeks and finished it with awe and wonder.	1
	robert langdon arrives to washington dc only to find he was lured there by a fanatical mystic who calls himself mal'akh.	1
	the most terrifying villain ever created by dan brown, mal'akh is a muscular giant tattooed from head to toes with religious and mystical ancient symbols and is set on a quest to be godlike himself, but an evil god.	1
	he is obsessed with obtaining the lost word known only by the most elite of free masons and to that end he has brutally kidnapped langdon's longtime dear friend and mentor, billionaire and secretary of the smithsonian, peter solomon.	1
	mal'akh has cursed the house of peter solomon for many years in his relentless pursuit of secret knowledge.	1
	years ago peter solomon trusted langdon with the golden capstone of the legendary masonic pyramid.	1
	mal'akh gives langdon an ultimatum: in order to save peter, he will have to decipher the capstone.	1
	what follows is a race against time through various washington landmarks that yield clues and along the way langdon puts the pieces of the puzzle together.	1
	peter solomon's sister katherine is a noetic scientist whose experiments prove the power of the human mind to affect subatomic matter.	1
	the implications of her work are powerful, literally 'mind over matter.'	1
	mal'akh set on destroying the house of solomon and especially anything that could enlighten humans detours to destroy her lab and would even have killed her if langdon had not intervened and warned her.	1
	but the warning was almost too late.	1
	and the scene in which mal'akh chases her throughout a pitch dark airplane-hanger-like building is utterly chilling, and they way that she escapes is literally brilliant!	1
	the scenes of this book linger in my mind continually revealing their multiple layers.	1
	katherine and langdon team up as they evade the cia director of security, a small, stern and dirty chain-smoking woman inoue sato.	1
	a survivor of japanese internment camps and of throat cancer, she hunts them relentlessly pursuing the capstone  and langdon's decipher skills for her own mysterious reasons.	1
	but just when they believe they have saved peter, they realize they were tricked again by make-up wearing mal'akh.	1
	he ambushes them in his secret lair and puts robert langdon through the greatest torture imaginable and forces katherine to watch in horror.	1
	he drowns robert langdon to make him reveal what he knows about the symbols on the pyramid and then leaves him for dead.	1
	dan brown raises suspense to a whole new amazing level as the reader is forced to grapple with the words on the pages which tell the story of robert langdon's drowning.	1
	the tale becomes even scarier as it is revealed the full facts of who mal'akh is, what his true motives are and the real reasons why he has relentlessly haunted the life of peter solomon.	1
	the climactic confrontation between peter and mal'akh ends with painful revelation and glass shattering shards of truth that pierce the heart and lead the way to the final breathless scenes.	1
	the lost symbol is an incredible novel of life, death mind and spirit!	1
	dan brown flawlessly weaves the history of the masons and of the founding fathers of our nation together with notions from ancient wisdom, the judeo christian scriptures and noetic science.	1
	the result is an awe inspiring masterpiece of biblical proportions.	1
	riveting.this book did not disappoint.	1
	i found myself holding my breath in anticipation of the next paragraph.	1
	i'm glad i bought it immediahtely.      	1
	slow beginning, lame middle and great ending.finished the book in two days.	1
	the beginning is somewhat slow, and you get the feeling the author is 'showing off' with esoteric definitions in the middle.	1
	wonderful finish, and by finish i mean the last 1/3 of the book.	1
	worth reading, especially if you're a fan of the genre.      	1
	non delivered product.i ordered the dan brown book the lost symbol on october 10,2009. so far the only thing 'lost' has been the book!as of nov.10th i have not received the book and no one knows where it is.my review rate is '0' but i had to enter 1 as your system will not accept a '0'.      	1
	blistering fast read.dan brown must have blistered hands.	1
	the book is lightening fast and suspense from beginning to mid section.	1
	i'm not through with my read but i can't wait to get back to it.	1
	i'm planning my evenings around this book!      	1
	a total disappointment.it's a total disappointment, it has a very lame ending and total waste of money!      	1
	love it.i have been waiting for dan brown's next book and found the book to be worthy of the wait.	1
	the book is so well written and researched, as all his previous books.	1
	i found myself checking out the images on the internet.	1
	i even called the telephone number and got peter solomon's voice mail!!	1
	it was a great read.	1
	i am sure there will be washington dc -lost symbol tours offered soon!!	1
	!      	1
	better than davinci code.i don't understand the negative reviews at all.	1
	yes, it is similar to the davinci code.	1
	langdon figures out a lot of puzzles while in extreme danger racing around a world capitol.	1
	but this book does it just as well, if not better, than the davinci code.	1
	the masons are more interesting than opus dei.	1
	i am more familiar with washington, dc so i felt more involved in the chase.	1
	i feel more connected to the message of this book (the reach and the power of the human mind) than i did to possibility that jesus had a child.	1
	if you liked the davinci code, then i'm sure you'll like this.      	1
	the lost symbol.excellent novel.	1
	a number of twists in the plot which keeps the reader guessing right up until the end.      	1
	great book worth the wait..outstanding book.	1
	the reseach into the philosophical basis of freemasonry was epic.	1
	thank you dan brown.      	1
	the lost symbol.the book was in good condition, but they charged almost as much as the book for shipping.	1
	there was no way it would have cost that much.      	1
	great book.	1
	expect as much if not more then the rest of dan brown's library..if you like dan brown's writing style you will like this just as much if not more then the rest of his books      	1
	loved it.can't understand the low ratings.	1
	i've been doing things for others more thanks to this book.      	1
	dan brown needs a reality check.i would really like to know where mr brown does his research.	1
	in the da vinci code he clams that the priory of sion is fact!!	1
	wrong mr brown it was made up by some french lunatic.	1
	in this novel mr brown wants us to believe that this noetic 'science' is a 'breakthough'.	1
	wrong again these ideas have been around forever there was a guy in the 60s who said he could physiclly affect plants.	1
	also mr brown would have us believe that the founding fathers of this country were pagans that they bulit a shrine to the pagan gods in the us capitol.	1
	besides the fact that ive never read this in any history book most of the founding fathers were christian.	1
	being christian it would be scaralige to build a shrine to false gods.	1
	again mr brown has written a work of complete fiction sold it as such but still manages to convice some dummies out there that what he writes is fact!!	1
	wish i had his abilites.       	1
	at least as good as the da vinci code.i read the book as fast as i could.	1
	of course as a dan brown classic, it was very interesting, exciting and made me wanting to read as fast as i could.	1
	i think it was better than the da vinci code, since it was set in washington, dc and told a much closer history.	1
	also, dan brown's perspective in god and religion was much more clear in this book, which made me ralize his perspective made a lot of sense.      	1
	a really good dan brown story.i waited a long time for this book's release, and i was not disappointed.	1
	while i enjoyed davinci and a&d; more, i thought this was a very good novel.	1
	normally, i don't read fiction, but i am into symbology.	1
	therefore, i do read dan brown novels.	1
	i particularly liked the 'lecture parts' that everyone is more disappointed with.	1
	the action portions were less enjoyable for me.	1
	i don't understand the less-than-stellar reviews for this book because it is just as good as any great thriller out there, i.e.	1
	grisham, cornwell, or clancey.	1
	what more can one want from a novel: you learn something, and you are thoroughly entertained.	1
	this book delivers on all counts.	1
	dan brown also changed up his basic boiler plate.	1
	the bad guy was known from the beginning.	1
	this alone added tension because you were waiting for other developments that weren't really there.	1
	the book kept the tension and surprises coming, i thought.	1
	dan brown is my favorite author and just may remain so.	1
	can't wait until his next book.      	1
	a page turner with a wonderful message.i started reading dan brown 5 years ago when a friend handed me angels and daemons.	1
	a&d; made me read all other db books published previously.	1
	after reading the lost symbol i still maintain angels and daemons as his best book.	1
	i still give symbol a 5 because despite the similarity in plot to all his other works dan brown is trying in a story format to convey his excellent understanding of freemasonry and the spiritual laws that govern it.	1
	he also shares a view of religion that i believe is capable of saving the world if humanity embraces it.	1
	apotheosis, or the potential of man as god, is a common theme across most religions and db does a great job explaining it to a world that has lost the idea or would consider it as heresy.	1
	i thought brown did a great job expressing the freemasonic and spiritual leanings of the founding fathers of the united states and presented a view that i believe settles the debate over whether we are a christian nation or not.	1
	his answer is that we are a spiritual nation that believes in decency towards others and a view of the whole world as creatures with a potential to become gods.	1
	this prospect makes any differences or disputes over religious issues insignificant and distracting from what we can truly become.	1
	a word about controversy.	1
	this view of man's destiny to become god is where the controversy lies in this book and i expect to see some heated discussions about it by the clergy in the coming weeks.	1
	to those who thought that davinci code and its theories about the virgin mary were a source of controversy wait and see until the clergy read this book and understand the message it is conveying.	1
	i am glad that brown did not succumb to conspiracy theories.	1
	i liked the spirit by which he portrayed the great craft of freemasonry and the mature understanding of religion and spirituality which he portrayed during the book.	1
	looking at some of the reviews that are already online it is unfortunate to note that many of these reviewers had such a narrow focus and failed to comprehend the great message within the story.      	1
	best dan brown novel yet.what an amazing accomplishment!	1
	i'll now need a dan brown 'guide' to revisit d.c. this robert langford adventure is even better than the da vinci code, and the author's delving into the scientific and metaphysical aspects of knowledge that suggest what our nation's founding fathers were really trying to create in this country are the most inspiring ideas i've come across in a long time.	1
	the action is fast-paced, and i was trying to finish the book at one reading, but my tired old eyes finally rebelled.	1
	i think this one is probably the best novel i've read this year.	1
	i got my copy from the library, but i plan to buy a copy to keep and read again.	1
	thank you, dan brown, for a wonderful, wonderful reading experience!      	1
	more preaching, dan brown is master, we are little children.all dan brown wants to do is preach.	1
	his books are like the liberal media.	1
	he tries to show objectivity but in reality he is just a preachy little automaton trying to sway his readers minds.	1
	dan brown has no respect...zero respect...for his readers.	1
	danny sees the mind of his reader as a blank slate upon which he will mold and fashion.	1
	this book was nothing more than danny pumping up freemasons.	1
	garbage.      	1
	unreadable trash.i hadn't especially liked dan brown's previous books, but i wanted to read this one so i'd know what the fuss was about.	1
	turns out that i simply didn't have the stomach for it.	1
	after a bit under an hour i really just had to stop.	1
	the writing was bad, but the science was worse.	1
	dan brown takes the greatest hits of para-psychological research and...pretends the studies actually worked.	1
	seriously, wikipedia this stuff if nothing else; he's on crack.	1
	this is 9-11 truther/birther level wtf.	1
	not the most promising basis for a novel.	1
	that the novel begins with 'fact: all rituals, science, artwork, and monuments in this novel are real' makes me wonder whether his editor was even awake. 	1
	the wait is over!.robert langdon is back, and he's on another fascinating case.	1
	this time, he's up against the ultra-secret society of freemasons, with enough cryptic clues and arcane historical facts to please everyone who loved the two previous langdon stories.	1
	of the three, this one just might be my favorite.	1
	dan brown is really an amazing author.	1
	very few writers can mix so much history, science, folklore, and sociology into a thrilling suspense story as successfully as he does.	1
	if you liked the first two langdons, i don't have to tell you to read this one.	1
	if you haven't met langdon yet, what are you waiting for?	1
	highly recommended.      	1
	take the day off and read!	1
	!.without ruining any small detail , all i will say is that the book was 'well worth the wait!'	1
	though, i never understood that saying, as i would much rather not have waited!	1
	again, brown makes reading fun, stimulates the imagination and challenges the intellect.	1
	the lost symbol is every bit as good as any of his previous novels.	1
	i have only one question for mr. brown, 'when is the next book coming out?'	1
	enjoy!	1
	!      	1
	i am astonished!.i have enjoyed all dan brown's books, but less than halfway through the davinci code, i began to notice he used the word 'astonish' with all its suffixes -ed, -ing  -ment --ingly far too much.	1
	astonish is a strong word but used too often it dulls the shock value.	1
	i wrote to his editor and pointed this out because if the author doesn't catch these things a good editor should.	1
	so, a few months ago i pre-ordered the lost symbol.	1
	when i got it, by golly, there was the first 'astonishing' on page two of the prologue.	1
	i decided to keep track.	1
	i am now on page 51 and the word has already been used 5 times!	1
	so, at once per every 10 pages, that should make about fifty times i will see it in his 500 plus pages.	1
	does he even read his ms. over?	1
	does his editor?	1
	doesn't he have enough money to invest in a good thesaurus?	1
	i'll write again in a few days (after i finish it) and give you all the final tally.      	1
	unbelievably bad writer.it's unbelievable that dan brown, an apparently well-educated writer, can do such sloppy research and writing, given the fact that in this day and age he has access to so many means of doing research - and at least one or two good english grammar books.	1
	his only 'positive' attribute as a writer is his ability to appeal to those who don't care for any shred of accuracy in descriptions of locations or events.	1
	my head still spins over the first book of his that i tried to wade through.	1
	(note, mr. brown...hold onto this description; perhaps you can use a protagonist with a spinning head in your next book.)	1
	i had just returned home from having lived in paris for several years and was eager to launch into what i'd hoped was a good read with a parisian setting (the da vinci code).	1
	within the first 20 pages, i knew i was in for a disappointment.	1
	he totally messed up paris' geographical scheme in that book while racing about into strange, poorly researched (i.e., innacurate) theories and odd characters.	1
	and grammar be hanged!	1
	i must admit, i have not read 'the lost symbol', which i am supposed to be reviewing here, but i did read the synopsis and many reviews, which was more than enough exposure for me!	1
	having gotten 3/4 way through his prior book before tossing it into the garbage, i hoped he had changed his writing formula in 'the lost symbol', but apparently he has not, and this new book, from what i read, is simply a warming-over of the previous book.	1
	granted, brown is laughing all the way to the bank, as he has found a way to drag the undiscriminating readers along, hearts pounding, through his messy storytelling.	1
	some readers argue that we who criticize his writing should 'lighten up, it's only fiction'.	1
	it certainly is!	1
	it takes all kinds of readers, and apparently dan brown has a healty following,  i, for one, am not among them.	1
	maybe i am in the minority, but i will continue to opt for good grammar and at least something close to facts, unless the preface states that the books are 'fantasy writing', as brown's so obviously are.         	1
	robert landon returns....i always thought that dan brown would retire to some deserted island after the success of 'the da vinci code.'	1
	there he would sit on the beach and sip pina coladas.	1
	i'm sure the favorable response the film received and some prodding from tom hanks got mr. brown back in writer's mode.	1
	you might compare 'the lost symbol' to indiana jones meets 'national tresure.'	1
	years ago mark frost wrote a novel titled 'the list of 7.'	1
	in it arthur conan doyle pursues the freemasons in london.	1
	coincidence?	1
	another fascinating read if you enjoy the genre.      	1
	another great work of fiction from dan brown.i still cannot believe how fast i read dan browns novels, i was not this into a book since i read the divinci code.      	1
