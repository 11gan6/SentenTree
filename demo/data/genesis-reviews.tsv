	seats are too stiff.	1
	auto folding outside mirrors.suspension needs to be slightly softer	1
	6 month review of my genesis.see my original review ' instant classic' on 04/21/09.	1
	i've now own my genesis 3.8 tech for nearly 6 months.	1
	no problems so far, fit, finish, ride remains top notch.	1
	the exterior design is even better than first thought while the mileage slightly less (lots of city driving) than before.	1
	the integrated bluetooth is used extensively and all autos should have them for safety in today's cell phone culture.	1
	the navigation even easier to use once you know all the short cuts i've had no problems with the suspension and the ride remains a nice balance between soft and hard.	1
	never a day goes by that someone takes a noticeable interest in my genesis, this automobile is special!!!!	1
	!favorite features:lexicon 7.1 dvd sound system.	1
	hd/xm radio.	1
	incredible night vision with adaptive headlights.	1
	interior design remains impressive.	1
	the interface has been outstanding (bluetooth, voice command etc.)	1
	cooled front driver seat and the a/c is impressive (live in s. florida).	1
	still quiet, quiet, quiet!!!	1
	!suggested improvements:cool the front passenger seat.	1
	the dvd will soon be allowed to play during driving for passengers (tech as already been developed for this).	1
	make genesis a sub luxury brand.	1
	all genesis should be sold with wings on hood, trunk and wheels.	1
	this makes the genesis stand out by itself.	1
	pleasant surprise.i was looking into buy a new car.	1
	i considered the genesis brand.	1
	i changed the badge and i am happy with the car.	1
	it moves well and is comfortable.	1
	hopefully, the car will last me for quite a while.	1
	i like the back lit controls at night.	1
	really cool to drive infavorite features:engine displacement and handling.	1
	i feel very confident on the road.	1
	highway driving is really fun actually with this carsuggested improvements:the rims are a little plain.	1
	i suggest a better designed rim, though the rim quality is high.	1
	i like five pointed spokes.	1
	great car.after 6 months of research i bought it.	1
	has tech pkg.	1
	quite, solid, fast, head turner, comfort.	1
	i have no complaints about the ride.people has mistaken it for a mb, lexus, bentley.	1
	would be nice if the cd player was also a automatic changer.	1
	but the xm is great.favorite features:tech pkg.,xm, seats, style.suggested improvements:cd to be auto changer, sun visor extenders.	1
	genesis - truly a beginning.incredible experience!	1
	speed/power, luxury and incredible soundsystem.	1
	did i mention how fast it is?	1
	looked at lexus gs350 but have no regrets.	1
	car is a real head-turner.favorite features:power, luxury, audio/nav system, styling.	1
	the ride is excellent, handles extreme;y well in tight spots.suggested improvements:retractable side mirrors control, lighted home control buttons, ability to see phone book in bluetooth, remote start	1
	needs much improvement.need hand grips on under side of steering wheel.	1
	no timer for front or rear defrosters.	1
	sunlight washes out nav screen and rear back up camera.	1
	need larger sun visors with side extenders.	1
	windshield washers only spray lower windshield.	1
	limited warranty on all electronic items.	1
	bad blind area when drivers seat is all the way back.	1
	need light under hood.	1
	rear mud guards are to small.	1
	both front seats need the same features and more thigh support.favorite features:push button starter.smooth flow of power.	1
	rear sun shade.	1
	nav system.	1
	good gas mileage.sound system.suggested improvements:use better tires dunlops are rough and hard to balance.	1
	easier steering.	1
	rides like a truck.	1
	typical hyundai, genius.no complaints whatsoever.	1
	i'm kind of a person that likes to buy based on value.	1
	of course, hyundai was the ticket.	1
	though, i was a bit skeptical about the hyundai brand, the genesis shattered my perceptions about the brand.	1
	i can not say how classy the car remains even after a few months of ownership.	1
	put a genesis badge and the car is not that much different from a bentley imo.favorite features:steering wheel has a nice soft touch.	1
	the stereo controls are a simple and intuitive.	1
	the amenities galore, wow.suggested improvements:change the badge to something artistic and symmetrical.	1
	though, i get the two people shaking hands thing with the slanted h, most consumers will not get that esoteric art.	1
	rides too rough..i bought my pre-owned 3.8 from a man who is known to be less than frugal who really 'unloaded' this beauty upon me.	1
	it is a gorgeous car, but after i drove it 850 miles it reminds me of the gorgeous, brainy woman who can't boil water.	1
	only the bmw 318i that i just sold rode worse.	1
	the suspension system is horrible.	1
	when the tires are cold you can feel every tar strip in the highway.	1
	the guys who designed the suspension should not be allowed to graduate fro high school this year.	1
	the steering is also numb and it becomes very tiring to be driving with the intent to find a good centerline feel and have that suspension fighting me.	1
	there is too much road noise being transmitted into the car.favorite features:the design statement, interior feels great.suggested improvements:redesign the whole suspension system.	1
	it rides about as bad as the bmw.	1
	the cup holders are too few in number and poorly placed.	1
	it could use a bluetooth that will download my entire address book.	1
	the one in there is a bit low tech.	1
	worth every penny.i got a genesis for my wife's birthday.	1
	she couldn't be happier with the car.	1
	it was a 3.8 l with plenty of luxury accouterments.	1
	she certainly will drive this baby for the next ten years or so.	1
	it is snowy in michigan, can this thing last in snow.	1
	well, the good thing is that the genesis was fitted with winter tires.	1
	hopefully, the rwd architecture will handle the icy conditions.favorite features:navigation is a breeze to go through.	1
	the styling is classical but understated.	1
	the eight airbags and overall safety features is a + for the wife and kids.suggested improvements:the seats are a little too stiff for my liking.	1
	i generally like plush seats, as in my old american cars.	1
	but that complaint is more of a nitpick.	1
	i'd like to download more media files onto the hard disk of the onboard computer.	1
	the dvd player should play when driving.	1
	happy with car.i needed a new car, since i drive pretty often in the new york metropolitan area.	1
	found this beauty of a car.	1
	the 3.6 l v6 with technology.	1
	i can not find a negative quotient or facet where this car lacks.	1
	it's plenty big, plenty strong and comfortable for the long trips down route 80 and i-95.favorite features:steering feel is ver precise for a hyundai.	1
	the sensitivity of the wheel column makes the driving experience much easier.	1
	the back lit nights during long trips make it look very chic.suggested improvements:heated and cooled seats for both passengers is a suggestion of mine.	1
	beginning of a beautiful relationship.you know, things aren't always what they seem.	1
	i've been driving caddy's for a quite a while in my life time.	1
	i'm an ol timer, not too old.	1
	but i gotta say that this vehicle really took me by surprise.	1
	seeing the way how korea has become a modern country.	1
	i can not be surprised to see the level of development in their car manufacturing.	1
	i got this 3.8 for about 37,500 at iowa city.	1
	it is a great deal.	1
	it reminds me of 1988 all over again.favorite features:the general clean and acceptable interface of the car design.	1
	the outside is bent on telling a person that, i am one serious driving machine.	1
	the inside is a place of nice diversion.	1
	where i can listen quietly to high end classical music.suggested improvements:the ride, as some people say is on the stiffer end.	1
	i lowered the pressure on my tires to improve the ride.	1
	i do insist on hyundai to listen to more customer input regarding ride comfort.	1
	it's a great vehicle.got this beauty for 38,000 with the tech package.	1
	i couldn't be any happier.	1
	the thing moves and is very nice to be inside.	1
	looking forward to future hyundai vehicles.	1
	especially the equus.favorite features:the heated and cooled seats: rear window shades: cup holders for back seats: luxo-like ride, especially in the back: 293 bhp: 25 mpg in the highwaysuggested improvements:the style is a little derivative.	1
	i like the mercedes like front grill.	1
	but the back looks too much like a bmw.	1
	get some creative s.korean designers to draw the back end.	1
	this car is a contender.i got this car yesterday after test driving this vehicle.	1
	i certainly can say that the genesis has a one of a kind personality.	1
	though the car feels much more expensive, with luxurious appointments, the price paid was only 41,500 with all the options laid out.favorite features:bluetooth for multi-tasking and a very easy navigation system.	1
	the car is very comfortable.	1
	and, the back-seat drivers feel chauffeured to their way a destination.	1
	the interior size is truly a nice thing to appreciate extremely safe car.suggested improvements:ummm...... maybe i should have waited for the 2010 genesis.	1
	hyundai is developing a state-of-the-art 6 speed transmission which will be butter smooth.	1
	as well, as more fuel efficient.	1
	the break feel can improve a slight touch.	1
	incredible car for the money.have had mine for only 3 weeks but i am loving this car.	1
	i am constantly being stopped in the parking lot to find out what kind of car it is.	1
	it is roomy, powerful, and luxurious.	1
	i drove lexus e350, infiniti m35, bmw 535 and this.	1
	bought the hyundai the next week and have no regrets.	1
	it stands out in the crowd of those cars on the road and is much less expensive.	1
	the ride quality is excellent in my opinion.	1
	i ride normal roads, some good and some bad, but i don't see where people are coming from in saying the ride quality is bad.	1
	this is a helluva car.favorite features:ac seat, rear camera, lexicon sound system is incredible, powerful engine,quick braking, telescoping headlamps.suggested improvements:address book sync for bluetooth enabled phone.	1
	larger cup holders.	1
	homerun of a deal.i got my 3.8 with the technology package and i can not say enough about the car.	1
	i also deflated the tire pressure to improve passenger comfort.	1
	it is interesting to hear people complain about the suspension, when in fact hondas, mazdas, and now fords ride give me a backache every time i drive one.	1
	the dealership experience was solid.	1
	it felt like i was getting a luxury car at a costco.	1
	there was nothing wrong with the dealers at hyundai.	1
	they treated me well, they knew the details about the genesis.	1
	as well, they did not rush me or push me to make a purchase on the hyundai.favorite features:good interior appointments and bluetooth/mp3 integration.	1
	the navigation system is a breeze to use.	1
	and the car is truly spacious.	1
	good handling car with that independent five link suspension.	1
	the doors slam with a solid thud.	1
	as well the car is very well built.suggested improvements:soften the ride a little bit.	1
	the hyundai engineers should figure a way to create a 2 mode suspension system to give the option to customers for a rider's car or a lounge/cruise car.	1
	great all around.you just can't get more car for the buck than the genesis.	1
	i wanted an entry full-size luxury car for a little over $30k, and so my options were limited.	1
	shopped against toyota avalon, a few buick models, ford taurus, even the hyundai azera, and there's no contest here.	1
	of course one can get a used lexus or something, but i wanted a new car, plus hyundai has the great warranty.	1
	and even if i could afford a new lexus es or gs, i'd much rather save the money for gas and go with the no-name genesis.favorite features:ext and int styling.	1
	nothing original, but it's just a good looking car.	1
	also, the engine (v6) is powerful, quiet, and has surprisingly good fuel economy.	1
	also, there's just nothing pretentious about driving a genesis, and i like that.suggested improvements:ride can be a little smoother.	1
	rear- visibility isn't that great, but it seems like the trend these days with smaller windows.	1
	great car..i really love this car.	1
	the price was great.	1
	i got every option you could purchase and it is alot of fun to drive.	1
	the nav system is superior.	1
	i think the nav system is overpriced but worth it for me.	1
	the only complaint i have is about the road noise.	1
	i could really tell the difference between this car and my old car when i went thru the car wash. it was much louder.	1
	my old car was a lincoln ls.	1
	to get a comparable lincoln i would have had to spend about $10,000 more.favorite features:nav system is great and very very easy to learn.	1
	headlights turn with me.	1
	rear camera system.	1
	i have trouble backing up any other car without it.	1
	it is amazing how fast you get use to it.	1
	interior colors get many compliments.	1
	(black and brown) car price was great.suggested improvements:sun visors feel cheap.	1
	less road noise.	1
	everything else is great!	1
	suspension is the problem.i just got my car on aug 6th 2009 (manufactured date: july 7th 2009).	1
	in general, i love this car lots.	1
	only thing that ruins this car is its suspension.	1
	it is fun to drive but it is not comfortable with its crappy suspension design.	1
	the 7-speaker system is good.	1
	and trunk, glove box and handrest box are big but no partition at all.	1
	there is no way to organize the items, quite a mess.	1
	many people starred the car while driving.	1
	and it brings some talks with friends and strangers while parking.	1
	water came into trunk when open.	1
	please and please fix the suspension in all effort for the pioneer (who bought the first year genesis) as the compensation.favorite features:1. hid 2. the look (inside and outside) 3. super quiet, loved it so much (hope no rattles in future) 4. cheap insurance (bcos it is hyundai i guess) 5. good value with this kinda price.suggested improvements:1. hyundai should fire the suspension design team or at least the team lead.	1
	2. backseat cannot be folded 3. water comes into trunk when open (i don't believe it, but yah, what a dump design) 4. back to #1, suspension ruins the whole car comfortability.	1
	a follow up review.a follow up since my last review back in may.	1
	i now have 2500 miles on it and it is still doing just fine.	1
	this piece of advice may help with those complaining about the hard ride, i just spoke with my hyundai service manager about softening up the ride.	1
	he told me that the car comes from the factory with a hard rubber tire, and that if it had a softer rubber tire on it, it would ride better with less bumps.	1
	i'm not complaining, i still have all the luxury, i still have over $25,000 in my pocket vs owning one of those other high end luxury brands,its cheaper maintance, and everyone still walks around the car admiring it.	1
	i'm just waiting on hyundai to appreciate us genesis's ownersfavorite features:everythingsuggested improvements:no passenger cooled seats	1
	incredible driving machine.i love this car.	1
	i was in the market for a bmw 535i (also considered audi a6 and infiniti m35) until test driving the genesis 4.6 with tech package.	1
	power and acceleration are great, delivered smoothly and eagerly.	1
	handling is also very capable considering the large size of the car.	1
	the car is extremely quiet, even with sunroof tilted, making it easy to enjoy the 17-speaker lexicon stereo (with cd/dvd-audio player and mp3/ipod inputs).	1
	fit and finish is excellent, and i really like the clean, intuitive layout and controls.	1
	technology is well integrated and works well (bluetooth, voice recognition, etc.	1
	).favorite features:power and performance, quietness and refinement, fit and finish, lexicon stereo, technology and navigation system, build quality, lots of luxury features (to many to name!	1
	)suggested improvements:a few minor tweaks would make this an even better car: cooled/ventilated seat for passenger (not just driver), address book transfer over bluetooth, and power-folding (not just power tilting) side mirrors.	1
	high hopes now back to bmw.nothing but praise for the first few thousand miles then occasionally starting goes to about 400 rpm and runs rough.	1
	had to shut down.	1
	access steering would run halfway down and would have to manually reposition it.	1
	rear air would intermittently go to full hot (so much the the center console and side of the drvr seat was hot to touch).	1
	these's a tech order out on the heat but the dealer is not allowed to change the part unless they can duplicate the problem.now the 'new' tau engine is knocking for the first few minutes after start indicating a possible internal lubrication problem (dealer not sure if problem).	1
	first start of the day get out and listen.favorite features:nav system ease of operation and ride comfort.	1
	interior fit and finish.	1
	cockpit control locations.	1
	sound system second to none.suggested improvements:get the engineering right before putting on the mardet.	1
	amazing vehicle.i have to admit, i thought i would never buy a hyundai but i just bought one of these and wow, i am amazed by the fit and finish of this car.	1
	i just sold my lexus so i am used to a nice ride but this takes the cake.	1
	the way the car excellerates and handles is very impressive.	1
	i love the quality of this car both in and out.	1
	the controls are very will thought out and every one of them seems to be placed where it needs to be.	1
	i think i am going to enjoy this car for years to come - thank you hyundaifavorite features:it is all in the ride and feel of the car when driving it.	1
	the power of the engine and the quiet ride make this car worth every nickelsuggested improvements:i do have a couple of suggestions for improvement but they are so minor they are almost not worth mentioning.	1
	the passenger seat should be height adjustable.	1
	the front cup holders should be further apart.	1
	there should be a compartment for eyeglasses.	1
	the genesis logo and 6 cd changer on base model.	1
	this car is sick!.hyundai went above and beyond with this car.	1
	too much fun!!!	1
	for the money, there is not a better value on the market, period.	1
	i love the fact that this car is indeed a hyundai, which appeals to a person like myself who wants luxury without the cliche of owning infiniti, mercedes, bmw, etc.	1
	the surprise that comes with the discovery that it's a hyundai is priceless.	1
	i've had a few issues with the afls (adaptive front lighting system) and she was in the shop 3 times in about 2 weeks.	1
	eek!	1
	but that's been the only issue, and considering it's a production model i was expecting a lot worse.	1
	true, it's been less than a month but i don't care, she's here to stay!favorite features:push button start, surround sound, voice activated controls, gps with a yellow pages built into the system so that my car can find my a hotel, restaurant, anything and just take me there; interior, sun roof, auto rear shade, exterior - i love this car!suggested improvements:adaptive cruise control would be a nice perk but overall this is a wonderful car.	1
	would be nice if the phone was able to read text messages aloud (maybe it can and i just haven't discovered it yet...)	1
	very poor suspension.the plain truth about the 2009 genesis is that it has a horrible suspension and rides like an old truck.	1
	you can feel every bump in the road.	1
	i think you could run over a fishing worm and feel it.	1
	this severe defect is not immediately noticeable during a short test drive.	1
	the dealer states that this is designed into the car because it is a high performance automobile.	1
	it is fairly smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets.	1
	the ride is the most important element of a car and it fails my expectations.	1
	i'm not alone in my review of the suspension.	1
	read the hyundai genesis web site for more.	1
	the car is a beautiful car in all other aspects it is fantastic.favorite features:the car's quietness, and the pep of the v8 engine are noteworthy.suggested improvements:replace the suspension system.	1
	it will be the downfall of an otherwise fantastic automobile.	1
	it doesn't rate the title of 'north american car of the year' because of its ride.	1
	luxury at a bargain price.i have had my v6 3.8 purchased with all available options for 4 months (7k miles).	1
	i love this car.	1
	i not had any issues and it is a great value.	1
	i am averaging 23 mpg in mixed driving.	1
	my friends with more expensive cars (e- series, lexus ls, etc.)	1
	cannot believe the bargain.	1
	in fact, my boss just traded in his infiniti m45 on a v8 genesis.	1
	claims he saved over $150 per month on his lease and gave up very little in luxury or performance.favorite features:what i like best: - luxurious and roomy interior - the lexicon sound system and the tech package are absolutely awesome.	1
	- the price - quiet ride - the lexicon system (worth repeating- it's that good!suggested improvements:- ability to import phonebook into bluetooth - adaptive cruise control - blind spot monitor - put all features on the passenger seat that come with drivers seat - adjust suspension to reduce bounce at low speeds on uneven roads - improve the dealer experience -not on par with luxury car dealers	1
	a wonderful car.i was looking to replace my old bimmer, and i found a car that looked twice like my own.	1
	i thought it was a new bimmer.	1
	but, to my surprise, it was a hyundai, out of all cars.	1
	that car i saw provoked me to look at the genesis.	1
	i test drove the darn vehicle and i never looked back.	1
	i can say for certain that, like other posters, test driving the genesis is a sure fire way take the hyundai into your garage.favorite features:eerily quiet ride.	1
	i can hear a pin drop on the mat.	1
	the level of strength in the chassis makes it look like tank.	1
	but the surprising revelation is to realize the big genesis is a hauler.	1
	and it can handle like smaller car.	1
	something a bigger car should not be able to do.suggested improvements:i agree with one of the posters here.	1
	some people actually snickered at me, when i told them that it was a korean hyundai.	1
	little do they know that hyundai is a well respected #1 shipbuilding manufacturer.	1
	soon they will climb in the automotive field as well.	1
	change the luxury marque.	1
	amazing value!.less expensive and more fun to drive than a lexus gs350.	1
	eye-catching styling, great ride, and roomy interior, both front and rear.	1
	shouts 'quality!	1
	'favorite features:gps and sound system.suggested improvements:air-condition front passenger seat and add motorized back-up mirrors and programmable front passenger seat.	1
	this car is exceptional!!!	1
	!.i bought this car the day after my birthday in april.	1
	i absolutely love this car!!	1
	it is the best kept secret.	1
	most people think that mercedes,lexus and bmw are the best, but 'no'!	1
	this car out rides and performs these cars and other luxury cars for less than their prices for sure!	1
	i have the 6 cyl and the black on black.	1
	i love the lexicon sound system and the comfort and quiet cabin.	1
	i am having the wings put on and drive everyone crazy!	1
	i get alot of stares now while driving.	1
	everyone should at least test drive it!	1
	you will not be sorry!	1
	check it out!!	1
	!favorite features:the push botton start,the soft leather seats,the interior design,the outside smooth lines design and so much for the $$$$$$$suggested improvements:maybe a fold down rear seat!	1
	beautiful girl, bad personality.this car appears beautifully built and superbly appointed.	1
	it looks and feels like a $70,000 car for half the price.	1
	it exudes class and the fit and finish and appointments compete with the best in the industry.	1
	the dark secret is that it has horrible suspension and rides like a truck.	1
	this severe defect is not immediately noticeable - the suspension has a dual personality.	1
	it is beautifully smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets.	1
	it is horrible to drive and i regret leasing it.	1
	i am deeply disappointed.	1
	a short test drive doesn't reveal the quirky suspension characteristics.	1
	'this beautiful girl has a bad personality'.	1
	beauty is more than skin deep.favorite features:everything!	1
	the way it looks, interior appointments, fit and finish, lots of features, lots of room and peppy performance with the refined v6 although it could have a more sensitive throttle.	1
	i love everything about this car, except having to drive it.suggested improvements:if hyundai wants to become a serious player, they need to fix the suspension now.	1
	it rides like a 15 year old ford f150.	1
	the genesis doesn't even ride like a car, let alone a luxury car.	1
	this is why i rate the comfort and fun to drive ratings as low.	1
	everything is so right except the suspension.	1
	a wonderful car.i bought this car for about 42k even.	1
	and i can not say enough about this car.	1
	it has everything i would ever want and then some.	1
	i can say for sure that the engine is very powerful and the handling is great.favorite features:the lexicon audio is superb quality.	1
	the quietness of the interior makes this a true luxury marque.	1
	and of course the powerful engine makes it fun to drivesuggested improvements:create a sport mode suspension to take advantage of the independent suspension and rear wheel drive.	1
	lemon car.adding to my review of may.	1
	transmission has abnormal metallic clunking and slapping noise.	1
	this has caused the rear end to have some gear play and gear wine.dealer miss in formed me as to cure.	1
	hyundai factory tech had no answers and hyundai customer service has stiffed me.	1
	there are no parts or adjustments for these electronic transmission.	1
	dealers service manger and hyundai tech drove a new in stock car and told me this normal for rear drive cars.favorite features:smooth flow of power push button starter rear window shadesuggested improvements:larger sun visor with side extention light under hood	1
	4.6 w/tech.this car blows me away - it's worth every penny, the technology is top-notch, the interior is unbelievable.	1
	it's quiet, comfortable, and tons of power.	1
	my only complaint (reason for 9 in comfort) is road noise from the dunlops and a little stiffer ride than i would have expected.	1
	aside from this, it's still one of the quietest cars i've been in.	1
	wing badges are essential, but leave the flying h on if you really want to raise eyebrows.	1
	hd radio = awesome.	1
	xm = not really all that awesome after listening to hd.	1
	navigation works very well.	1
	seats are very comfortable for me even at 6'6' and over 300lb.	1
	best of all = wife loves it.favorite features:lexicon + laminated front glass = audiophile's dream.	1
	gauges and trim illumination at night feels like a spaceship cockpit.	1
	the v8 purrs...and screams - very smooth power curve.	1
	camera and parking assist are very nice.suggested improvements:slightly longer delay in shifting than expected, could be a little quicker shifting.	1
	dunlop tires (at least the 18's) are noisy but do offer good traction.	1
	bring on the supercharger!	1
	i saw pics of advanced settings that are not currently available (ride height, etc), make this available.	1
	i'm impressed.the 4.6 hyundai replaced my lease expired chrysler 300 hemi.	1
	the hyundai is a better driving car and has more luxury features.	1
	the ride is smoother and quieter, the quietness being my first impression when i test drove the car.	1
	i don't think it has quite the acceleration of the chrysler, but way more than enough for the traffic situations i drive in.	1
	the hyundai exterior design is not as impressive as the chrysler, but the interior is beautiful.	1
	the car is loaded with a surprising amount of luxury features, for the price.	1
	the car is as roomy as the chrysler and has as much trunk space.	1
	the seats are well designed for comfort.	1
	driver controls and pushbottons are readily accessible.favorite features:quiet soft ride is most impressive.	1
	i also like the electronic push-button start system that makes it very difficult to lock your key in the car.	1
	very important to forgetful people like me.suggested improvements:driver side rear view mirror poorly positioned.	1
	blocks view of nearby on- coming traffic and objects.	1
	annoying when making a left turn.	1
	home-link button to garage door not easy to see at night.	1
	have to turn on map light.	1
	audio signal for parking brake release when starting car would be nice.	1
	elated by this car!.i can't say enough good things about this car.	1
	8,000 miles so far and not a single problem.	1
	performance is awesome, handling is very good and the ride, for my standards is just perfect.	1
	i have owned bmw's and a mecedes before this car and never thought i would buy a hyundai.	1
	well, i don't think i'll ever waist $30k again just for the sake of a euro label.	1
	this car is in every way that matters to me, a better car.	1
	i simply love it!favorite features:interior design, engine, lexicon systemsuggested improvements:power adustable pedals, darker tint option for the windows.	1
	it is a very good car for the price..you can not find a better deal than the hyundai genesis.	1
	i actually think that hyundai is subsidizing this car in the united states to raise their image in north america and abroad.	1
	if people can not appreciate a 60k dollar car that is priced at just 33k dollars, what will make american customers satisfied?favorite features:290 bhp, amenities like a beautiful interior, sound system, whisper quiet ride, handling prowesssuggested improvements:the badge will not sell this car unfortunately.	1
	i do think hyundai needs to rebrand this car to a sexy and sleek name.	1
	the badge also needs to be accentuated to promotes its own prestige in the luxury market.	1
	what a great car.have been waiting for 3 months to write this... have had the car for over 3 months now, over 10,000km driven already.	1
	can't wait to drive it everyday.	1
	the acceleration is silky smooth.	1
	it has tons of power,(375hp) tons of torque, it handles great!	1
	i'm amazed how good this car brakes!	1
	interior is very upscale, fit and finish is superb.	1
	imo, tech package is worth it.	1
	gotta stop putting so many positives cause you won't believe what i'm saying.	1
	don't try this car unless you're ready to buy it.	1
	countless times people asking me what car this is.	1
	amazed at how many rubber necks while driving are looking at the car...i have put the winged logos in the back and front.	1
	hyundai...great jobfavorite features:exterior styling, power, v8 engine, tech package, leather seats, brakes...gps is very well laid out!	1
	lexicon sound system...omg, bluetooth works great!suggested improvements:tires make too much noise.	1
	change them.	1
	cooled seats should be available for the passenger seat too!	1
	deteriorating after 10k miles,.i may be one of the unlucky ones.	1
	after 10k miles rattles and creaking have started to surface and they are getting worse.	1
	especially one loud rattle from the rear end.	1
	doesn't sound like a $40k car any more.	1
	my old jeep made less noise.	1
	registered my issues with hyundai.	1
	hope the rest of you don't wind up like me.	1
	killed the fun.favorite features:you do get a lot of good features, but if you are like me, the rattles and squeaks diminish them.suggested improvements:build a car that holds up.	1
	by the way, i'm not rough on a car.	1
	one beautiful car.i bought this vehicle in jan after looking at lincoln, maxima, chrysler 300 of which i had a 2005 and it seems a million others and this one came out on top every time.	1
	i have not had to go back to the dealer once since i have bought this car and people are always asking me about it.	1
	i have the 3.8 with the premium pkg and would not change it for any other car.favorite features:i love the push button start and entry system along with the front and rear park assist.suggested improvements:i wish they offered bluetooth with every model.	1
	hyundai's arrived.after researching luxury vehicles for over 8 months, i decided on the genesis.	1
	i bought the 4.6 with the tech package in february when they became available in my area.	1
	boy am i glad i bought this instead of the lexus ls 460. same car for 30-40k less.	1
	while the lexus ride is smoother, genesis matches most everything else.	1
	why pay more?	1
	i put the korean badging on it and enjoy watching the rubber-neckers wonder what type of car it is.favorite features:tech package was the best of all the cars i looked at.	1
	sound system is everything you need.	1
	love having an ipod integration that charges the ipod as well.	1
	cooled drivers seat is a must in the desert.	1
	plenty of power to zip in and out of traffic.suggested improvements:need a cooled passenger seat.	1
	also a few issues picking up the bluetooth automatically.	1
	an automatic trunk seems to be the standard now as well.	1
	wat to go hyundai.what a great car,although i don't think its perfect it sure is nice.although price did enter into my decision on buying it wasn't the only item.	1
	my last car was a cady cts and was nice car but way overpriced imo.i got the 6cyl genesis after testing both i went with the 6cyl and its got plenty of power 4me.i got the package that has everything except backup cam and gps,4me it wasn't worth the extra money.i find this car so much fun to drive and am amazed at how many ppl stop me and ask questions,i could be a salesman due to my high praise for this car.after buying cars for 40 years this is the first car i have been so fired up about.cant say enough good things and only have very minor dislikes.favorite features:really hard to say but i guess comfort,style,and sound system is tops.suggested improvements:i live in arizona desert so maybe a higher fan speed on ac.	1
	although the suspension is ok if it was a bit tighter may be improvement.	1
	the car is junk..after 9,000 miles, i'm embarrassed to take people in the car.	1
	there's a new rattle every day - the doors, the dash, you name it.	1
	it's worse than the 1980's gm cars.	1
	the car restarts itself - people really laugh at me when that happens.	1
	the nav sends me into lakes.	1
	the transmission clunks.	1
	the engine stalls pulling out into traffic, which is terrifying.	1
	you can't stand to sit in it for more than 30 minutes.	1
	it vibrates.	1
	in cold weather, it clears one side of the wind shield and freezes the other.	1
	the rear defroster does nothing.	1
	the list is endless.	1
	i'm a real customer and not a shill that's why you're getting the real truth from me.favorite features:nothingsuggested improvements:test the car for more that 10 miles before trying to sell it.	1
	it is a pleasure to drive this car.we bought this as a second car to our first one being mb gl550 and i have to tell you from interior and performance perspective it is comparable but from technology perspective this car is years ahead of mb.	1
	ride is great, acceleration is awesome - mixed freeway, in-town driving is giving us 18.5-19.5 mpg with only 450 miles on it so farfavorite features:1. technology - bluetooth, navigation 2. comfort feature - where when you turn the car off, seats move back and steering wheel moves us but then when you start it comes back to the last position 3. while reversing, the lines it shows which help you guide through the surrounding is simply greatsuggested improvements:1 would have liked an option to switch between comfort and sports ride as right now it only gives you sports ride 2. ability to sync phone book between phone and the car	1
	absolutely outstanding.i have bought this car two weeks ago as my substitute for my old bmw 525. genesis is really excellent car.	1
	it is really smooth and luxurious.as long as i know, there are no comparable cars in this segment in terms of cost- benefit analysis.favorite features:excellent looks with spacious inside.	1
	good gas mileage.suggested improvements:if hyundai put the genesis logo on the car, they can get as much as 10% higher price.	1
	love, love my genesis.i love driving this car!	1
	we purchased the 3.8 with the tech package & tinted windows.	1
	it got great mileage on a recent trip.	1
	enjoy the quiet ride.	1
	definitely a luxury vehicle.favorite features:the great sound system, rear window screen and backup camera.	1
	the seat cooling system has been pretty nice in hot weather!suggested improvements:there is not enough easily accessible room in the dash area for items such as coins, notes, keys, whatever.	1
	i agree, a fold down back seat would be nice.	1
	about all that would fit in that little opening in the trunk is a fishing pole!	1
	best kept secret.the genesis 3.8 v6 is the best kept secret in the luxury car lane ... but undoubtedly not for long!	1
	leased my new black, premium-plus pkg genesis about 3 weeks ago after my usual exhaustive, but comprehensive research.	1
	every aspect of the car's looks and performance has met or exceeded my expectations; in short, this is honestly not another car on the road i would covet over my genesis!	1
	the power train is silky smooth, tons of acceleration power on demand, smooth transmission with super-powerful, turbo- level boost in manual shift mode when entering onto highway ramp or pulling out into fast oncoming traffic.	1
	lines of the car are the envy of every co-worker and valet who's seen itfavorite features:mysteriously elegant lines (what is that car other drivers actually say), smooth performance, luxurious interior, spectacular lexicon sound system; and the value-based pricing for it all!suggested improvements:maybe rear seat fold-down option would be useful, but trunk is huge so not an issue for us.	1
	may be trivial, but how about a rubberized 'tray' like storage for coins and such?	1
	sunglass holder?	1
	we love it!!	1
	!.we have been looking at the genesis since they were first announced here in the us.	1
	always thought they were a great car for a wonderful price.	1
	well the deal we got last week was just super, and we could not be happier with our new vehicle.	1
	acceleration is super, really puts you back in your seat.	1
	the handling is spot on, very tight in the turn and you have a great feel of the road.	1
	best of all we love all the gadgets.	1
	we got the tech package and it is worth every penny.	1
	the sound system is unmatched and the driver's information system is as good as i've ever seen.	1
	lexis, bmw, and benz need to really be worried.	1
	same quality and service for 2/3 the price.favorite features:v8 and tech package.	1
	the fit and finish is really top qualitysuggested improvements:	1
	it's for real.after reading edmund's reviews and spec's, i dug deeper into consumer ratings and overall satisfaction.	1
	i owned a toyota avalon and planned to go back to the avalon.	1
	the features and amenities on the genesis are just too many to list.	1
	the dealership owned both toyota and hyundai and put both cars side by side - clearly the genesis came out on top.favorite features:style - amenities - the t4 package.	1
	have them put the genesis logo on the hood and trunk.	1
	the gas mileage jumps up by keeping it at 65. really enjoy air conditioned driver's seat.	1
	the 17 speaker sound system is super.	1
	the people stopping you to comment on the looks of that car.suggested improvements:make genesis dealerships - not hyundai.	1
	the sales staff are not use to having luxury autos and do not try to sell up to genesis.	1
	air condition the passenger seat.	1
	reclining rear seats.	1
	4.6 is very good.just picked up 4.6 w/ tech pack.	1
	we were also considering bmw 550 and mb e500 and have owned two new 530's and lexus ls.	1
	bmw's are great cars but expensive to maintain and repair out of warranty.	1
	drove the 3.8 and was impressed w/ quality and drive.	1
	the 4.6 is the ticket though, smooth v8, powerful, great stereo.	1
	i would swear this was lexus if this car were un- badged only because the seats feel more lexus'ee than german.	1
	hyundai, very well done!favorite features:v8, ride quality, sound system.suggested improvements:cooled passenger seat.	1
	a real sweet car.got my 3.8 on 5/22 - and just returned from a 1,800 mile trip to s.c. despite getting into some horrendous traffic jams - the car still delivered over 25 mpg!	1
	ride is quite smooth - but not perfect - especially on rough roads.	1
	beautiful and comfortable interior.	1
	whisper-quiet engine with lots of power.	1
	(can't understand why anyone would want the 8 cly.)	1
	i did not order the tech package, but bought a garmin instead.	1
	unless you need frequent directions - this is the way to go.	1
	my bluetooth cannot read my voice commands!	1
	will make an appointment with dealer to fix.favorite features:power, quiet interior, lots of roomsuggested improvements:blue tooth should be able to 'read' phonebook!	1
	cruise should be able to be turned on permanently!	1
	center screen easily washed out in sunlight.	1
	hard to beat.purchased the genesis 4.6 with tech package for my wife as a replacement for her acura rl.	1
	while lacking snob appeal, hyundai's execution on this vehicle is impeccable.	1
	after 2 months, she is extremely happy.	1
	the car is a pleasure to drive.	1
	extremely well appointed.	1
	great performance.	1
	so impressed with this car are we that i've purchase a 3.8 liter coupe.	1
	while not as much car as a g37, at 15k less i'm very happy with the coupe as well.favorite features:suggested improvements:	1
	2009 hyundai genesis experience.i'm so glad that i bought this car.	1
	i planned to buy a lexus but i decided to buy this car after researching about this car.	1
	i'm so glad that i made the right decision and i like my genesis very much.	1
	this car performs just like the article in the february 2009 consumer report issue decribed.favorite features:the list is too long, but i like the response of the car, the brake, the interior and the ride is comfortable and quiet.suggested improvements:i do not know should i suggest folding down backseat?	1
	i may not need this feature since this is my pleasure car to drive and not to haul stuff!	1
	genesis.i ordered the genesis 3.8 (v6) with the level 2 package (sun roof, lexicon radio, 18' wheels etc.	1
	), not the tech package.	1
	i love the car!	1
	i changed the hyundai logo to the genesis 'wing' on the rear, wheels and front hood.	1
	have 2500 miles on the car after driving from florida to new jersey.favorite features:interior room.	1
	quite ride.	1
	usb and ipod/mp3 player interfaces.suggested improvements:auto retracting side mirrors.	1
	a light in the center console (to make connecting a usb device easier.	1
	the big dog.just bought mine 5/13/09 cabernet red with black leather with the tech pkg.	1
	soon as i left the dealer i went and got the windows tinted, beautiful car.	1
	i get compliments on it everywhere i go, just took my brother back to the honda dealership where he bought his civic and when he went into the dealership there was no one in there, they all had run outside to look at my car and they told me that it was a beautiful car and that for the money it was the best car on the market.	1
	(that has to say something coming from a honda dealership) people tell me all the time that it looks like a mercedes or a lexus in the front.	1
	as far as the interior of the car it is top notch quality with great featuresfavorite features:looks mean with tinted windows, equipped like a mercedes 500 or a lexus 460 for $25,000 to $40,000 less.	1
	i paid $38,000 for a fully loaded v-6suggested improvements:the only thing would be the ride is a little harder than i would like, even though i know its classified as a luxury sports sedan.	1
	but i love the car	1
	very nice car.we test drove toyota avalons, honda accords and other cars but once we drove the genesis, nothing else compared in the price range.	1
	this is a very solid, well built, car.	1
	very quiet on the road, good handling and good acceleration.	1
	great warranty.	1
	i have owned hondas, toyotas and lexus in the past.	1
	so far, this is my favorite car.favorite features:quiet, great stereo system, comfortable seats, huge trunk, reasonable fuel economy.suggested improvements:hid lights on the premium package.	1
	exceeds expectations at every level.this is a perfect value proposition for a person who in the 80s and 90s drove lincoln town cars and since 1998 a flawless infiniti q-45.	1
	i like quiet comfort and no mechanical problems, and so far so good.	1
	the genesis has the exterior styling of much more expensive bmw and lexus sedans and the interior is roomier than the town cars and the q. the back seat leg room is amazing and without skimping on trunk space.	1
	the trunk is half again larger than the q. the v6 has plenty of power and the transmission is as smooth as can be.	1
	my mileage depends on the brand of gas, and i get 29 mpg on brand name regular, and 25.5 on off-brand, a 10% trade off.	1
	the q was 20 mpg on premium.favorite features:the comfort & ride, the power, the mileage on regular gas, and the luxury looks inside and out.	1
	the xm is wonderful.	1
	the trunk is huge and there's a little door from the trunk to the inside between the back seats for long items.	1
	the keyless access and ignition are nice features.	1
	the 18' wheels.suggested improvements:wind & road noise in cabin at highway speeds disappoints.	1
	my other luxury cars were significantly quieter.	1
	opinion: the $4,000 gps package is overpriced; i passed.	1
	don't like harsh white color of interior lights.	1
	swap steering wheel radio controls, channel to volume position; it's counterintuitive.	1
	2009 auto of the year for good reason!.i researched this auto in depth prior to purchase.	1
	after driving it, itraded my corvette for it!	1
	375hp, accel that pulls'g's', beautiful finish, luxury leather, 1500 miletrip: 27.5mpg at 70mph.	1
	quiet, cool, beautiful, people ask me ifit's the new bmw / mercedes / infiniti--they cannot believe it when they see the hyundai emblem!	1
	acoustics are phenomenal, tech package is a must!	1
	i love my genesis!	1
	!favorite features:tech package, looks, performance, the whole package.suggested improvements:have nav display speed of vehicle; use speed of vehicle to determine time to destination instead of using the user input average speed on hiways, residentials, etc.	1
	use actual speed of vehicle.	1
	download updates to gps automatically.	1
	smooth.bad ride hard steering need 6 way and air cooled passenger seat.	1
	dunlop tires to much road feel and balance problems.	1
	drivers seat to small not enough thigh support.	1
	nav system pain to learn.	1
	transmission has a slapping sound when stepping off and on the gas.favorite features:smooth flow of power.	1
	push button starter.	1
	very good gas mileage.	1
	build quality.suggested improvements:need grips on under side of steering wheel.	1
	easier to buckle rear seat belts.	1
	brighter nav display in the day time.	1
	deeper rear seat arm rest cup holders.	1
	impressive.coming out of a toyota with 176k miles my expectations were huge.	1
	my old car never had so much as a squeak or rattle.	1
	after test driving bmw, acura, lexus and others, hyundai earned my business because the genesis is every bit the car it is represented to be.	1
	as far as i can see, they didn't cut any corners.	1
	i work in an industry where image is very important and this car gets tremendous compliments from clients, valet workers and strangers.favorite features:the v8 is the best feature.	1
	mustang gt power but i got 27mpg on my last big road trip (and i was doing 80mph most of the way).	1
	2nd best feature is the styling which is on par with mercedes and bmw.suggested improvements:ride, while taut and secure, can sometimes border on stiff.	1
	sometimes feels 'nervous' over uneven/broken roads.	1
	2nd suggestion would be to have an extender built into the sun visors to catch those holes by the rearview mirror.	1
	11k - first report.this car is simply a stunning thing to behold.	1
	it looks good, drives well and is very comfortable for my 6,2 frame.	1
	on a recent round trip from florida to cleveland the car averaged around 30.4 mpg at highway (some mountain driving) speeds.	1
	i deem that outstanding considering the cars size and weight.	1
	i have two complaints; 1.the suspension seems to hit the bump stops quite often on choppy roads.	1
	2.sometimes the rear doors wont automatically unlock.	1
	this situation happened after a software update to the car.	1
	the dealer will check it out at the next service.	1
	other than that i am a 'happy camper.	1
	'favorite features:the gas pedal response of the v6.	1
	the overall look and finish of the car.suggested improvements:1.a hood for the display screen--when the sun is directly overhead it is difficult to see the display.	1
	2. automatic volume adjust for the audio system.	1
	great value - luxury on a budget.i've had my 2009 3.8 genesis with tech package for about 6 weeks.	1
	have not seen the dealer since i bought - it was delivered with no defects.	1
	the interior is pure luxury and the lexicon sound system is unbelievable.	1
	the ride is whisper quiet.	1
	the suspension has been a topic of discussion for many.	1
	in some circumstances, there is a little more bounce than i'd expect and in others i cannot believe how smooth the car handles.	1
	i only seem to notice the suspension at slow speed on uneven pavement.	1
	the car handles great and is very roomy.	1
	i am getting about 23 mpg on regular gas with a mix of highway and city driving.	1
	this is a luxury car at a bargain price.favorite features:lexicon sound system, quiet ride, luxurious interior, confident handlingsuggested improvements:phone book import into phone directory, adaptive cruise control, fold down rear seat, blind spot monitoring.	1
	dealer experience needs improvement for a luxury car sale.	1
	love this car.love the genesis,i had the car for one week the car is a good value for the money.	1
	i had an lexus gs, which was an better ride but the sound system was not as good as genesis.on rough roads the ride is not stable i have black/black wtih tech package,had the window tinted and the car came with the wing package.several people asked what it was.	1
	with only 240 miles the fuel economy is unknown.favorite features:the sound system and push button start are my favorite features.suggested improvements:the nav system do not give the name of the streets and no coin holder.the trunk do not go up by itself when opened	1
	so far extremely satisfied....i have owed a volvo s-80 2002 purchased that year and wanted to change it for a 2009 until i saw the comments written on edmunds, about the genesis.	1
	my wife and i went on a test drive and we enjoyed so much the drive and the comfort that we bought it when we got back to the dealership and at a price nearly 16000.00 less than a volvo s-80 2009.i'm being congratulated continuously by people seeing it for the 1st time.	1
	the value of this genesis is outstanding.favorite features:stereo, backup cameras and parking sensors and most of all comfort.suggested improvements:replace ashtray by something else.	1
	it will suprise you!.there is plenty to say about this car...all positive.	1
	the 3.8 has great acceleration and should satisfy most drivers.	1
	the gas mileage, well i have to keep checking it to make sure it is right!	1
	my wife drives mostly in town with a few highway trips and is getting 24 mpg on average.	1
	a quick 300 mile trek jumped it up to 28 mpg.	1
	i see other complaints about the suspension but we are pleased with our car; the wind and bumpy roads do not affect the ride that much and is an exceptionally quiet ride.	1
	my inlaws dumped their 2 year old lexus after riding with my wife on that 300 mile trip.	1
	if you just have to have the snob appeal and want to pay 20-30 grand more for the same lux then have at it.favorite features:tech package, the nav system takes us to the front door of most places and the lexicon stereo rocks...literally rocks the car when the woofer is cranked up!the most fav is all the folks looking at the car when i come out of the store and say...wow, what is this?!	1
	white satin paint is flawless!suggested improvements:the technology package is not user friendly and the books could be more intuitive!	1
	put ac in the passenger seat.drivers seat can use more bolstering and a tad more adjustment for us big guys.	1
	dealer network needs to move upscale!	1
	the sleazy ones never talk about the genesis, just $199 a month deals!	1
	genesis v6 with tech.i have had my car 3 days.	1
	what a wonderful car.	1
	white satin pearl with beige leather interior.this car is a beauty with great technology.	1
	form and function at the highest level.	1
	can't comment on mileage or reliability as it only 3 days old.	1
	i'm still going thru the manuals(they are excellent).favorite features:the list is too long.	1
	but at the top of my list is the audio system,the easy access getting in and out of the car,and the driver information system controller.	1
	it is so intuitive even i can work it.	1
	there are so many other favorite features.suggested improvements:i would like a coin holder for quarters, the back seats dropping down for putting long items in the trunk and the front passenger seat with easy access also.	1
	the genesis is an instant classic.purchased a v6 3.8 tech, silver/black interior, wing badges.	1
	you'll won't get a better car for the money.	1
	classy looks on the outside incredible opulence inside.	1
	well thought out design, comfortable seating, excellent handling, great power.	1
	and so quiet.	1
	the genesis is the duplicating what lexus did in 1989. this is my 5th hyundi in the last 13 years.	1
	every year they continue to improve their products and they hit this one out of the ballpark.	1
	from what i see and hear they seem to be attracting more bmw owners than any other luxury brand.favorite features:tech package period, keyless entry, voice command, lexicon 17 speaker surround sound.	1
	seats, little things, the windshield washer, backseat column a/c vents, ability to control heat in the back seat.	1
	turning radius tightest yet for a hyundai.	1
	quiet, quiet quiet!suggested improvements:folding down backseat, is the only thing that i would consider so far	1
	tracking.i like the car overall well enough.	1
	quality is good.	1
	the only problem i have noticed so far is the tracking at highway speeds is a bit loose - that is, it wanders off desired track easily and steering is a little twitchy, especially in even a slight cross wind.	1
	i haven't driven it enough to develop an opinion about the gas mileage, reliability or other operation aspects.favorite features:suggested improvements:for luxury items : i would like to have onstar and collision mitigation system rather than back up camera.	1
	visibility is obscured in left turn, by window post and door mirror on driver side	1
	good bye bmw.my last two vehicles where the 528i and the 745i.	1
	hallelujah hyundai genesis!	1
	what more can i say, the car is great and without considering the price differential.	1
	the few detractors are simply jealous and it is all about status symbol for them.	1
	when i drove it home 3 weeks ago i found myself 50k dollars richer as i was about to buy the 750.favorite features:i do not know where to start first.suggested improvements:be able to download the phone addresses and retract the side mirrors.	1
	2009 genesis v6 prem pkg plus & tech pkg.i've owned bimmers, acuras, and a vw, however, the genesis is the piece de' resistance... the ride is amazing.. completely comfortable.	1
	phenomenal interior design and layout, with easy access to buttons, controls, etc.	1
	gas mileage is a wonder- jacksonville, florida to miami on 1 tank of gas (without reaching 'low fuel notification'.. very impressive for a car this size.	1
	the stereo is amazing, and sounds even better with real dvd movies, dvd audio, or a usb flash drive w/ high quality files :)favorite features:usb port, handling, gas mileage, comfort, cooled drivers seat, lexicon premium system, hid headlightssuggested improvements:bluetooth phonebook import, various updates to navigation system and the way it searches.	1
	great car.this car is everything i hoped it would be and more.	1
	it is designed to maximize the aspect of pleasure behind the wheel without going overboard.	1
	it is super quiet, has a magnificent stereo, air conditioned driver's seat, good visibility, comfortable seats, etc.	1
	mechanically the car is totally satisfactory.favorite features:suggested improvements:passenger seat cooling.	1
	no match for excellence yet.so many people are talking about it so i gave it a try.	1
	it sure looks like a elegant car, some what bmw, some what mercedes, some what lexus.	1
	yet, it is none of those, and that is the problem.	1
	there is total lack of personality.	1
	well, car is just a car taking you from point a to point b. may be.	1
	finding a car is not just a transportation device to me that actually bothers me.favorite features:stereo systemsuggested improvements:bigger side mirror,temperature sensor is not sensitive enough.the knob is dirt cheap.firmer seat, better leather.	1
	more sensitive acceleration padel.	1
	'do not test drive this car...'.i'm a huge car fan and the biggest bmw fan.	1
	test drove everything out there.	1
	being an insideline.com fan, was reading on the genesis and how impressed everyone was.	1
	went to test drive it at the dealership & that was it.	1
	i was hooked like a drug.	1
	could not take it off my mind.	1
	waited a couple of days went to test drive it again and was still stunned how well it drove and how great it made me feel.	1
	i just had to have it, a total no brainer for me - got the 4.6 tech.	1
	if you can test this car and go buy something else for the same money or even more, good luck.	1
	bravo hyundai, what an amazing job you guys did with the genesis.	1
	thank you!favorite features:the plush interior, super quiet, lots of space, amazing back seats, amazing highway cruiser.suggested improvements:of course it would be nice to have more luxury features but i'm fine the way it is!	1
	no complaints!	1
	rogers raves.i was looking at the honda accord v-6 & the saturn aura v-6.	1
	then i went to the l. a. auto show.	1
	what a learning experience!	1
	i saw the hyundai exhibit and the new genesis.	1
	i went home did some homework on the internet.	1
	the next thing i'm test driving the 3.8. i say to the sales man, let's talk numbers, we walk in to the show room, there it is, cabernet pearl, cashmere interior, and the premium package, with a big red bow on the hood.	1
	the price was perfect, the dealership extremely friendly, generous, personable.	1
	it;s been 3 1/2 months, 4,000 miles and i love my genesis.	1
	i know it's not american, but it beats anything on the market today.favorite features:everything.suggested improvements:none	1
	a winner.have owned many luxury automobiles, lexus, mb, infiniti, audi, and acura.	1
	this car is a winner.	1
	comfortable, responsive, quiet and fun to play with.	1
	have the premium plus pkg and tech pkg.	1
	also included the 'european prestige' pkg.	1
	given the choice, i would pick the genesis.	1
	just to note, some of the comments indicated that they had not read the manuals.	1
	the outside mirrors do not tilt down if the control is centered.	1
	left or right will tilt if the control remains on either left or right.	1
	this car should not be overlooked by anyone looking for a handsome, well made luxurious and reasonably priced auto.favorite features:audio, gps, back up camera and sensors.	1
	quietness, responsiveness of the 6 cylinder.	1
	overall luxurious look of the car.	1
	a pleasure to drive.	1
	mine is titanium gray metallic, with black interior.suggested improvements:automatic fold in mirrors, cooled and enhanced passenger seat (same as drivers), intuitive cruise control.	1
	bump unsettling ride.i just purchased a genesis 4.6 and although it is a high performance beautiful vehicle i am very concerned about the bumpy jittery ride.	1
	i actually had a headache from the bumpy ride.	1
	i test drove 3 different vehicles in houston and phoenix and did not experience the rough ride.	1
	but the vehicle i purchased was located for me to meet my color preference and the ride is rough.	1
	are there adjustments that can be made to smooth out the ride?	1
	is it tires, shocks?	1
	i am very concerned as i was thrilled with my purchase my now am worried i made a huge mistake.favorite features:interior and exterior look and featuressuggested improvements:	1
	best car i have ever owned.i had followed this car ever since it was revealed in detriot show.	1
	the only thing i can say is this is the best car i've ever owned.	1
	i was an advent nissan car owner, but when i test drove the genesis, i was sold.	1
	for what you get at the price, you can't beat it.	1
	a gentleman in a bmw 7- series stopped me in the parking lot to ask me what kind of car is that, i proudly said 'the genesis'favorite features:lexicon stereo, acceleration, seat comfort, interior design.	1
	heck everything!suggested improvements:gradual increase in volume level when restarting car.	1
	a way to turn off the stupid warning screen.	1
	excellent first step - room for imprvmnt.i see many criticizing the handling of this car.	1
	personally, i think it is close to perfect.	1
	i find most luxury cars too soft with the handling and this car corners flat with predictable handling while not losing a luxury feel.	1
	it does have a tendency to porpoise a bit and there is room for improvement there.	1
	the thought given to this car and what is important to the driver is exceptional.	1
	i love most of the interior except the seats and headroom.	1
	i am 6' 5' and i feel the seat needs to be lowered or have some padding removed.	1
	the seats should also be bigger offering some lateral support.	1
	overall this is a winner for hyundai and if they listen to consumers it can only get better.favorite features:handling with predictable and responsive driving.	1
	aluminum and leather interior (need more of this).	1
	ipod, aux, and usb inputs.suggested improvements:fix 'porpoising', needs bigger seats w/lateral support, seats need the ability to lower more (headroom issues), trunk should automatically open *completely* like a mercedes, gas cap door is made of flimsy plastic, more wood and less leather for the steering wheel	1
	5000 miles with a wonderful car.compared to m45 and 535i.	1
	the genesis won before considering the 18-26k savings.	1
	quiet reserved car until 5k rpm at which point this becomes a drivers car.	1
	i still don't know the corner limits of this car.	1
	after 5k sometimes hard miles no rattles or other issues have come up.	1
	if your looking for high end content without the high end badge this is the car for you!favorite features:engine - so much power on tap.	1
	suspension - never met a corner it didn't like.	1
	stereo - best i have heard in any car.	1
	friends with infiniti and bmw comment on sound quality.	1
	interior design - leather dash insert looks great.suggested improvements:navigation interface lacks ability to search by city.	1
	trunk release on driver door is too small.	1
	engine is a little slow to warm when temps drop below 0 f.	1
	a good one.with less than 1000 miles i can still say that this is a really great car, especially when you consider the price.	1
	the fit and finish are superb, but the ride could be improved.	1
	the engineers should work on the rough and unsettled ride if they want to beat the big boys.	1
	we came from an mb 400e that was too old, but still gave us a great ride and handling.	1
	this is the first ownership of a car with all the bells and whistles, but we're getting used to it and it's fun.	1
	the acceleration is without peer and the interior quietness is excellent.favorite features:looks, acceleration, and price.suggested improvements:suspension	1
	jittery suspension.have owned my 4.6 for four months.	1
	it is a great car and excellent value for the money compared to mb,bmw and lexus.	1
	i've put 6500 miles on the car and the only thing that i don't like about the car is the jittery, bumpy ride on uneven roads, it is fine on the highways and on smooth streets.	1
	i live in south florida and the secondary roads here are pretty good compared to areas that get bad weather, however any imperfection on a road and this car goes into convulsions.	1
	i've complained to the dealer and basically the said there is nothing they can do about it.favorite features:tech package, awesome audio system, great gas mileage for a 375hp v8,awesome engine and trans.	1
	fit and finish inside and out.	1
	changed the emblems and wheel center caps to the wings, many people think that it's a baby bentley.suggested improvements:improve the ride, power folding outside mirrors, full power passenger seat with memory, chrome wheel option, illuminated garage door opener, power driver seat extender,touch screen navigation like the sonata and azera, power trunk opener and closer.	1
	dedicated genesis dealership.	1
	terrible ride.at first glance it looks like a lot for the money but on closer inspection the interior is cheaply constructed, you cannot transfer the phone book from your cell phone and the seats have no real lateral support.	1
	but all of this pales in the face of the terrible suspension.	1
	the ride is rough and jittery with a tendency towards porpoising on almost all surfaces, even those that appear to be smooth and or recently paved.	1
	i would test drive the heck out of a potential purchase and if you experience the slightest bit of what i have described, pass on it and look at something else.	1
	no other car that i have driven in recent years, of any price point, has these awful ride characteristics.favorite features:sound system.suggested improvements:1.fix the suspension.	1
	2.allow bluetooth transfer of cell phone phone book which is currently not available.	1
	5.improve driver seat comfort 4.fix the suspension!	1
	the genesis is a winner.i am a past owner of bmws, infiniti & mercedes.	1
	i never thought i would own a korean automobile until i test drove this car.	1
	hands down the genesis is the best car i have owned.	1
	for the first time i feel like i bought a car where the performance, quality, & amenities match the price.	1
	test drive this car & i bet you won't be able to forget the experience.favorite features:monster engine, hd navigation, lexicon sound system is unmatched.suggested improvements:ability to download my cell phones address book into the vehs computer.	1
	first week of owning new genesis.having owned virtually every german and japanese make on the market, i decided in today's economy, practicality should win out over creature comforts and german engineering.	1
	after owning a genesis 3.8 for just one week, i am convinced that while my decision was certainly practical, i will not lose out on creature comforts, performance or quality.	1
	this car is an absolute winner and every time i get into it, i smile knowing that it will cost me less than half the cost of my e320 over the life of the car and i can honestly say that it has better features, comfort, style and performance.	1
	this car is a winner and if hyundai can get the suspension right, they will really be on to something big.favorite features:tech system navigation is second to none, sound system and bluetooth handsfree system is far superior to toyota and benz.	1
	the car looks great from all angles and is very comfortable on long trips.suggested improvements:the ride is a little bumpy, suspension needs work.	1
	also has a tendency to pull to the left a little when driving straight.	1
	ability to load address book or sync calendar would be nice to have.	1
	hyundai is the next lexus.who would have thought that you could spend $40,000 and drive out of a dealership and own a world class automobile that rivals the 750-i bmw.	1
	the electronics alone are amazing but the car has good power with the v-8 and rides very smooth.	1
	it also is very roomy and handles great.	1
	i bought a mercedes e-350 in 2006 for more money.this care is quality.	1
	trust me.favorite features:navigation and blue tooth phone technology, nice smooth ride, powerful v-8 option, leather seats, camera, design,suggested improvements:none	1
	they have to get better at service.so today i went to power hyundai in scottsdale az for my first service.	1
	my nav/radio were fine.	1
	they tried to apply the t63 update and after three tries quit because the second dvd of 3 was rejected.	1
	the technicians called hyundai tech support all day and got no response from the tech people.	1
	my radio is ok but nav stopped working and all works verrrrry slooooowly.	1
	they promise to get this fixed.	1
	my beef is with hyundai tech support.	1
	what right do they have not to call back all day to a dealership needing help?	1
	i called the consumer line and was told by the only person i could reach that he would call a regional manager- obviously a useless ploy.	1
	hyundai needs to get organized/return calls!	1
	!favorite features:rides very well.	1
	comfortable.	1
	plenty of power in six cylinder.	1
	nav/radio were perfect until they screwed it up and hyundai did not return calls.suggested improvements:provide tech support to your own dealers so customers are not delayed and angry.	1
	amazing.i have just had my genesis since jan 17/2009.	1
	it beats the heck out of my chrysler 300 (2005) by a mile.	1
	i looked at nissan maxima, altima, lincoln, buick, cadillac and they did not even come close.	1
	the car is superb.favorite features:i love the front and rear park assist .suggested improvements:suggest they light up the garage door opener in the mirror	1
	that is a hyundai?.great looking, fun to drive and dripping with technology.	1
	i am 6'7' and fit comfortably in this vehicle.	1
	my vehicle is pearl back with tan leather interior and is a head turner.	1
	i can't tell you how many times i get asked 'what is that?'	1
	- of course once they are told it is the standard response - that is a hyundai.	1
	"if you are in the market for luxury sedan, you owe it to yourself to test drive the genesis.favorite features:voice activation and bluetooth connectivity.suggested improvements:motorized closing side mirrors, motorized truck open\closing feature."	1
	ability to import contacts form your pda via bluetooth.	1
	it's a keeper!.only having the car for less than a week makes it difficult to offer critique that might affect someone's buying decision.	1
	however, i am so impressed with how this car feels and performs that i am compelled to write something.	1
	prior to making this purchase, i checked every available review, both professional and consumer, and i shopped every available source.	1
	when it became clear that this car was one that i should strongly consider, i agonized over whether i would buy a 3.8 or 4.6 variant.	1
	for the difference in price, i am happy with my choice although both cars are winners.	1
	i have owned a stable of fine cars over the years, and, hyundai just didn't appeal to me...until now!favorite features:the lexicon stereo system melts the senses.	1
	the fuel economy for such a heavy, high-horsepower vehicle is absolutely amazing.	1
	the absence of noise of any kind is a true delight, and, the way this car 'feels' its way around the road is eerily similar to a porsche i once owned.	1
	the 'gawk' factor!!!	1
	!suggested improvements:ok...just to be balanced...how about a coin holder in place of the ash tray!	1
	?	1
	beware a bumpy ride.i just leased a base model genesis a week ago.	1
	sadly i like everything about it except the suspension.	1
	when i first test drove it, i noticed it was a bit bumpy, but i thought maybe it was because of the road i was on.	1
	i also noticed a few reviews mentioned bumpiness.	1
	but when i test drove it the second time it felt ok so i went ahead and leased it.	1
	after i took it home, i started feeling that the bumpiness was quite pronounced and at times jarring.	1
	i often find myself getting bumped up out of my seat, akin to the feeling of airplane turbulence.	1
	the vehicle has an odd combination of soft and hard ride.	1
	it feels cushy on a perfectly smooth road, but imperfections make the ride feel very bumpy.favorite features:attractive inside and out; good fit and finish; good smell; nice instrument panel; big trunk; smooth transmission; quiet; good safety features (not too many cars have both head curtain and airbag for the rear seats); spacious front and back seats; temperature control panel for rear passengers.suggested improvements:suspension needs big improvement (see comments above); water leaks into trunk when open wet trunk door; base model steering wheel should also telescope; volume control on radio should be continuously adjustable (lowest volume increment is not low enough); seat uncomfortable (due to lack of depth?)	1
	listen to my words.great car, much greater than my previous avalon.. actually, uncomparable..., im sorry.	1
	genesis deserves my loyalty to its brand.	1
	those who read this comment should rethink about the brand image of hyundai.	1
	just remember, toyota and lexus were once thought of as inferior.favorite features:reliability, smooth and quiet drive that gives sense of true luxury.suggested improvements:fuel economy; wheel design	1
	a hyundai!!!	1
	!.ok here it is...i purchased a hyundai.	1
	i feel so much better getting that out in the open.	1
	i was driving a lexus is before the...hyundai.	1
	still difficult to say.	1
	the car has great power with the v6, wouldn't pay extra for the v8.	1
	the ride is what you would expect from a lexus, benz or bmw.	1
	small storage space is limited.	1
	average 27-28 mpg on the hwy.	1
	being 6'1' the cabin has more than enough room.	1
	the back seat is also very spacious.	1
	simply said i love the car and at $31,999 the price was right.favorite features:exterior design.suggested improvements:more storage space.	1
	best car under $40k.after 6 lexus's, i decided to save $20,000 and purchase a 2009 genesis.	1
	after driving the car for about 6 weeks, i would honestly say i would purchase the genesis over the lexus even if they were the same price.	1
	best car i have ever owned!!!	1
	!favorite features:all...suggested improvements:	1
	hyundai genesis.the genesis with the v8 is a kick to drive.	1
	it is a very stylish car and the interior is beautiful.	1
	those are the two reasons why i bought it.	1
	there are a few kinks that still have to be worked out with mine.	1
	after having the tires balanced it is still rough on the interstate.	1
	the brakes still screech when i back out of the garage.favorite features:the responsiveness of the v8, the expensive looking body style, the tech package, and the interior make this an enviable car.suggested improvements:many of the cars it is capable of competing with have all wheel drive, it should also.	1
	the side view mirrors are so high that they block the view of cars at an intersection and make left hand turns very hard to judge, frankly i'm surprised it passes safety tests.	1
	my genesis.i tinted the windows and added blind side mirrors on both exteriormirrors as i like to switch lanes quickly.	1
	this car is the best car ihave ever bought.	1
	i compared it against the cadillac, maxima, lexuses350 and acura tl and like this car the best.	1
	my kids wanted me tobuy another chrysler 300 c but was sold on the rear leg room once they got to go for a test drive in my genesis.favorite features:love the smooth acceleration, the sound system and heated/cooled seats.suggested improvements:give us the option to remove the h on the trunk.	1
	i am glad the superbowl commercial made this car seem high end and changed the perception of hyundai.	1
	best value.i bought v-6 in october 2008. i drove mb & lexus in the past.	1
	this is absolutely much better car than mb and lexus if you take the price into consideration.	1
	if you are willing to pay $ 20 or 30 k more just for the brand, go ahead but i really recommend this car why you waste hard earned money, especially under a current economic situation.	1
	again, this car is equal to or better than mb or lexus in all respects except for a hugh price difference.	1
	i am telling you that if your are looking for a new car, buy this car, you will nor regret.favorite features:engine is so quite and v-6 is powerful enough.	1
	nice interior & exterior design.suggested improvements:i prefer a wood dash board.	1
	but wood is not available in premium plus or tech package.	1
	better than germans.this is my 96th vehicle and one of the best, if not the best.	1
	i've owned many toyotas as well as other japanese, german, italian and american cars.	1
	this one has the quality, the luxury, the comfort, the performance, the fun-to-drive and great gas mileage.favorite features:just a great car!	1
	everything you would want in a large sport luxury carsuggested improvements:ability to hold gears in manual mode (sport shift)	1
	nice, but definitely doesn't compare.i recently purchased a 4.6 genesis for my wife, and i'm not too impressed.	1
	an impulse buy really, but i'm beginning to see why the car is so much cheaper than my bmw.	1
	the engine is pretty nice, but in no way compares with my 550i's v8 (torque curve, etc).	1
	i'm pretty particular about my cars, and it's the little details with the genesis that turn me off.	1
	the materials just feel inferior, and it just seems like hyundai stole design features from all of their so- called 'competitors', down to the fake idrive and 5-series exterior styling cues.	1
	i think the buyers of this car will realize over time that this car is just a flashy attempt at producing a true luxury car w/o any substance.favorite features:ride similar to my wife's old lexus; sound sys.	1
	is better than any equivalent toyota.	1
	i can definitely see choosing this car over say an acura or lower end lexus, but just don't see how they say it competes with the german luxury makes or top- end lexus sedans.suggested improvements:market these cars against their true competitors, like the toyota avalon, camry, acuras, etc.	1
	this car is not in the same league as audi, bmw, mercedes, and lexus.	1
	simple fact: the car is made with cheaper components, therefore will cost less.	1
	interesting marketing ploy on hyundai's part though.	1
	genesis is a winner!	1
	!.i just passed 1200 miles and this car is a winner for hyundai.	1
	driveswell in erie pa snow.	1
	there is a luxury about the genesis that'drove' me to it.	1
	everything so far is excellent... as withall new model cars there maybe an issue or two that comes up.	1
	genesisprovides the higher cost models (lexus / bmw / acura / mercedes, etc) a true run for the money.	1
	the 5 year btb is one of the key components for the purchase.	1
	hyundai's decision to extend the extra year was a thoughtful and calculated one.	1
	i agree with all previous comments from other owners.	1
	i did research for at least 6-9 months prior to purchase and i am glad i did.	1
	the service is key to post purchase and success to hyundai.favorite features:agree with all previous comments.	1
	as hyundai builds the 2010 genesis i am sure they will incorporate the features that most 2009 owners have strongly suggested.	1
	i am waiting for a direct call from either the regional or national hyundai office to discuss the issues for improvements.suggested improvements:again, i agree with previous comments.	1
	if there are ways to correct some of the discrepancies now for the 2009, ex: a coin tray to replace ash tray.	1
	that would be a benefit and shows response to the consumer/owner.	1
	i strongly suggest that dealerships do not place the front license plate on front.	1
	very surprised....never thought i would ever buy a hyundai but i am truly satisfied.	1
	traded in my 540i which was breaking down for a much faster and smoother car.	1
	it doesn't handle like a bmw but still pretty nice.	1
	people tried to discourage me from getting a genesis and now they are the ones who are thinking about it after riding my car :)favorite features:375 hp, huge trunk space.suggested improvements:- all wheel drive model - touch screen navi - softer suspension	1
	great car but.....i have been a hyundai owner for about 5 years and have always been impressed with the quality of the cars for the money you spend.	1
	the genesis is absolutely no exception.	1
	i went in for an oil change on my old elantra, test drove the genesis, and got it that day.	1
	at least once a day i have someone comment on how much they love the look of the car.	1
	the solid performance rounds out a really great package.	1
	be careful though if you live in colder climates, the car is a real wheel drive which is great when it is nice out, and even in the rain but when it snows, the car struggles for traction (i spent 35 minutes today stuck on the side of a slightly inclined road while other cars passed)favorite features:the styling, ride, acceleration, and interior size (the trunk is tremendous and the back seats are very comfortable)suggested improvements:all wheel drive...the car handles horribly in the snow (especially from dead stops or on hills) and the stability control provides little help in those situations.	1
	luxury car benchmark.i am only 19 years of age but i know cars.	1
	my parents have leased several bmw's which i have driven.	1
	i decided to purchase the genesis because of all that you get for the money.	1
	the 4.8 genesis has 7 series luxury, 5 series performance, for a 3 series price.	1
	the pickup is better than the cadillac cts, bmw 3 and 5 series, mb c, e, and clk class, and lexus is, es, gs, and is even compared to the ls, 7 series, and s-class.	1
	this car will be remembered for years to come.	1
	a true collector's item an the age where collector cars have died out since the 1970's.	1
	i will definitely keep this car looking good and running well to keep value high.favorite features:rolls royce stereo (lexicon) suede leather seats nav, xm, backup camera, dvd playersuggested improvements:engine.	1
	there is nothing wrong with the 4.6 at all, but i would love to see a supercharged v8 or a v10 as used in the korean bread hyundai equus, which is american bound in late 2010 or early 2011.	1
	great job, hyundai.i've had my genesis for two weeks now and cannot say enough about this car.	1
	i also own a 2005 infiniti and the build quality on the genesis beats the infiniti hands down.	1
	the acceleration on the v8 is amazing.	1
	given the fairly similar fuel economy to the v6 and all the small extras you get with the 8, it's definitely worth the few extra bucks.	1
	i've driven an ls 430 several times and can say that this car knocks the lexus out of the ballpark.	1
	anyone who owns any of the major luxury brands and is in the market for a new ride should not discount this car simply because it's a hyundai -- and if they do, it's their loss.favorite features:remarkable acceleration, whisper quiet interior, decent balance between ride and handling; tech package is a must.	1
	ipod integration is a huge plus.suggested improvements:hyundai should consider having it's own dealer network for this car.	1
	if this is any indication of what hyundai can do from a luxury standpoint, a separate genesis division would surely be a home run for them.	1
	i can't take my eyes off her :-).i did a lot of research, checked out the competition (cadillac, infiniti, etc.)	1
	and the genesis out performs them by far.	1
	the fit and finish of this car is amazing.	1
	i find myself just stopping to admire her beautiful lines inside and out.	1
	everyone is surprised when you tell them its a hyundai.	1
	hyundai hit the nail on the head when developing this great luxury automobile.favorite features:lexicon 17 speaker system, nav system, loads of room, high quality leather interior (even on the doors), heated and cooled seats, comfort amenities galore, ton's of room, - the boys from detroit need to take note.	1
	too many favorites to mention.suggested improvements:make the korena market geneis wing logo standard on the car.	1
	i love this car!.before i bought it i test drove infiniti g35, m35 and acura tl.	1
	i even brought infinity m35 to hyundai dealership, parked both cars next to each other, opened all doors and trunk and almost compared each inch of the cars.	1
	i am waking up every morning and thinking: 'i will be driving genesis today again!'	1
	incredible car!.	1
	some previous reviewers seems like didn't read car manual.	1
	side mirrors reverse tilt down can be switched off, trunk has push button right above license plate (slightly to the right).favorite features:memory seats, backup camera, front and rear sensors,suggested improvements:	1
	you'll be surprised !.i have only just purchased this car, and i must tell you, it is fast.	1
	i have been driving an mb e500 and it is faster off the blocks and seems to have the same feeling that there is no end to how fast the car can go.	1
	it has all the high tech gadgets which are remarkably easy to operate especially by someone like me that eschews reading instructions and following complicated manuals.	1
	do not test drive the 4.6 unless you are prepared to buy this car when you return to the dealership.favorite features:premium leather seats, acceleration, quietness of highway ride, huge trunk, technology package and of course, the lexicon stereo.suggested improvements:sun visors should be more substantial and it would be nice to be able to remote start the car.	1
	excellent vehicle.i love my new genesis.	1
	it is the perfect vehicle.	1
	i just purchased the v8 tech package genesis and i could not be happier.	1
	it is a pleasure to drive.	1
	i find myself just going for a drive to no where specific.	1
	i love it.	1
	a+++++++++ i recommend that anyone interested in this type of vehicle at least go look and drive a genesis.	1
	you will absolutely love itfavorite features:design, features, ride.	1
	it is the perfect vehicle.	1
	i can't believe that it's a hyundai.	1
	hyundai has just put its name on the map.suggested improvements:none	1
	genesis is the new bmw!!!	1
	!.absolutely love it!	1
	i drive approx 23,000+ miles annually so its extremely important i have a vehicle that is comfortable, has get-up-and-go for the freeways, is great to handle up and down the mountains in california, that is classy yet sporty...i'm telling you this car has it all!	1
	everyone stares at the car - even those with beemers and mercedes b drivers in total disbelief.	1
	the car is a total dream to drive.	1
	i set cruise, set the seat back, plug in the ipod and off i go.	1
	i stayed with the v6 because that had plenty of power.	1
	i don't know i'd do with the v8.	1
	as it is i do 85/90 and don't realize it.	1
	awesome, awesome, car!	1
	go for it...seriously give the genesis thought.favorite features:the interior lighting is fabulous!	1
	its sooo soothing!!!	1
	the quietness on the freeway!	1
	the heated seats are awesome.	1
	the stereo is unbelievable!	1
	given the car is basically my office the huge trunk is a major plus!suggested improvements:darker tinted windows, an easier option to search songs on the ipod..using the dial starting at a to get to z is a bit ridiculous - it needs a quick search button or something.	1
	even better than all the hype!.never thought i'd buy a hyundai.	1
	but i gave up my bmw 3-series for the genesis, and i am extremely satisfied.	1
	far more luxury and better craftsmanship.	1
	the extra cost of the bmw is only for the slight handling edge on the track and for the bragging rights; i need neither.	1
	i put 3,000 miles on my genesis in just two weeks.	1
	every mile adds to the satisfaction.	1
	absolutely no complaints.	1
	if the genesis's reliability is closer to that of the modern-day sonata and azera rather than the '86 excel, that's all i'll need!	1
	had just spent 3 months in seoul, and was impressed with the koreans' fast- developing economy, technologies, and mentalities.	1
	the genesis personifies them all.favorite features:ride quality, craftsmanship, ergonomics, handling.	1
	plus the reverse snob factor - 'my lowly hyundai is far superior to your overpriced bimmer.	1
	'suggested improvements:line the trunk fully.	1
	do offer an optional sports package for the bmw crowd.	1
	offer some korean domestic market-only options to the us (adaptive cruise control, telematics, etc).	1
	early genesis 4.6 review.took delivery today.	1
	excellent build and performance.	1
	ergonomics above average.	1
	plenty of room for 6'4' driver (and legroom in back).	1
	tech package definitely worth buying.	1
	nav software not as good as ford's navteq, but acceptable.	1
	as quiet as my '93 mercedes s-class at highway speeds.	1
	lexicon sound system won't knock your socks off with bass, but has very sophisticated imaging that is superior.favorite features:very comfortable seating and visibility.	1
	backup camera, trunk room, 'white' interior lights.	1
	charcoal carpeting (no stains!)	1
	with light tan interior.	1
	5-star crash ratingsuggested improvements:audio information is not displayed when on nav mode.	1
	cannot dim nav/ audio screen with panel dimmer.	1
	awesome luxury car.i tested more than 15 cars, including lexus is, bmw 530, audi a6, mercedes e350, infiniti m45, jaguar xj8.	1
	none are better than the genesis!	1
	the quality is awesome, the car is solid & extremely quiet, the performance is great and the price is low for what the car offers!	1
	it has all the features of a twice as expensive car + 5 years full warranty.	1
	the interior is as big as lexus ls and bmw 7 series and the quality is just as good!	1
	ive been driving it for 1 month now and i cant find any flaws.	1
	the snobs might say: its a hyundai, but this is how lexus started as well.	1
	unless youre willing to pay $20-30k more for the brand name to buy a similar car, youll be impressed with the genesis!favorite features:keyless entry/start, quietness, interior space, awesome materials quality, usb drive, 18' wheels, lexicon 14 speakers sound system, stability control - awesome on snow, 8 airbags, leather trimmed dash, runs on regular fuel !suggested improvements:better all season tires.	1
	should be the genesis brand!	1
	genesis does a lot.i have owned 2 lexus's since 1998 a gs300 and clocked 187000 miles on it an excellent car which performed in all aspects wonderfully.	1
	i then bought a lexus is250 i enjoyed the all wheel drive but when reading about the genesis i was very intrigued and once i drove the 4.6 i was ready to buy.	1
	the car has all the features of both my lexus's except the doors don't unlock when in proximity to the car.	1
	the brakes are tremendous the steering perfect, fuel economy very good considering the v8 power,super ride, great acceleration, very fine interior materials comfortable seats and with technology package all the toys.	1
	i love the size of the car lots of comfort in the back seat best car i've owned.favorite features:the total package is what makes the car so great, quality, features, and value.	1
	solid with impressive styling i look forward to driving the genesis every day.	1
	i really like the front grill and wide stance i feel the v8 is special, super smooth and quietsuggested improvements:proximity sensor to unlock the doors like my lexus is	1
	the best car i ever owned.i owned cadillac since 1966 and wanted to buy american but driving the two cars the genesis was head and shoulders.	1
	i also drove lexus and lincoln.	1
	this is a well designed and built car.favorite features:nice ride good cornering and good gas mileage.	1
	large trunk and outstanding interiorsuggested improvements:speedometer needs to be redesigned.	1
	first hyundai.i am a long-time dedicated american car owner.	1
	this time after dissatisfaction with the american choices available i reluctantly begun to shop foreign cars.	1
	a friend suggested taking a look at the hyundai genesis.	1
	my first look was at a 3.8 and although impressed was not sold.	1
	when a 4.6 hit the lot i was done!	1
	this is a surprising car with the amount of interior and trunk space, ride, and quality of engineering.	1
	if korean automakers can do it so much better than our domestic models, it is no wonder we are having to bail out our own companies.favorite features:style.	1
	performance.	1
	attention to detail.	1
	aggressive sales and customer service.	1
	warranty.suggested improvements:passenger seats needs same adjustments options as drivers seats.	1
	tire pressure monitor gauge is too sensitive and gives false readings.	1
	high output lights should be standard equipment.	1
	move shift lever closer to driver and use space on left side of console for storage.	1
	what a great car at an awesome price..i have had the car since sept 2008. i was very apprehensive about buying a hyundai but loved the look and styling of the car.	1
	after the test drive and reading many reviews i was convinced to take the leap.	1
	3 months later i am still amazed and loving this car.	1
	i have owned lexus & cadillac but this is my favorite yet.favorite features:killer price to value.	1
	the technology package is a must....really cool stuff.suggested improvements:a minor thing but.....like i would like to have a touch screen on the nav system.	1
	oh...i am short and wish the driver seat went up in height further.	1
	(it gets plenty close to the steering wheel)	1
	nice car.i received the genesis yesterday.	1
	what a great car.	1
	iwas a little disapointed as far as the dealer.	1
	the very next day had to bring in for a airbag sensor.	1
	genesis should have there own dealership.favorite features:lexicin radio.suggested improvements:own dealership	1
	excited.my husband bought me this car for my birthday and now he wants to buy him one.	1
	we own several cars but i have to say this is the best looking car we have driven.	1
	i traded in my 300 for the technology packet.	1
	i test drove a benz, infiniti and several others this car beat them all.	1
	dont let the name hyundai fool you will love this carfavorite features:i love all of the featuressuggested improvements:all cars can use improvements but so far i have not found one on this car yet.	1
	let em look!.got a sterling blue v6 w/ tech/prem pkgs a month ago.	1
	i've been enjoying the car very much.	1
	it's fun to come out of stores and have guys standing around the car and saying 'that's a hyundai?'.	1
	i got the 'wings badge' for the trunk lid, just to keep them guessing.	1
	the car is a dream to drive, and very well designed inside.	1
	i wish i had more miles on the lease, as i would love to just drive, drive, drive.	1
	i expect that when this market recovers, this will be the car to own.favorite features:i love the radio/gps controls and the auto wipers.	1
	the gps is the best i've seen and easy to use.suggested improvements:when in reverse, i'd like the option to not have the side mirrors tilt down.	1
	i know it's a good safety feature, but takes a little getting used to.	1
	smooth out the hesitation at slow speeds.	1
	how about a remote start for when it's freezing out!	1
	luxury with performance and fun..access to this red pearl beauty (might remind one of a mercedes) is without reaching into a pocket or purse.	1
	the interior is soft and stylish (lexus comes to mind) and adjusts to fit the driver and passenger perfectly, seats, mirrors, steering, and controls.	1
	the air conditioned seats will not be needed this winter, however, the heated seats will make cozy ride cozier.	1
	recently on the interstate being caught up in a snarly of big rigs and car traffic, i thought i would test the 4.6 liter engine.	1
	i a few seconds the snarl was in the far rear view.	1
	i said to my wife, 'i just glanced at speedometer and we are just come down from 110 mph.'	1
	fun and pride come from owning the genesis.favorite features:the look of luxury, 18' alloy wheels, mercedes like front end, keyless entry, rain sensing windshield wipers, 4.6 power with fuel economy, great braking power, a very quiet and comfortable interior, a powerful sound system, and many more to mention without a priority.suggested improvements:the trunk lid needs a button like the front doors to open without having to reach for the computer chip (key).	1
	also laser guided cruise control would be nice too.	1
	the genesis a gs 460 for a 1/2 of the $.this is a beautifully made car that is going to put the europeans and the japaneses automakers to shame.	1
	a car with this much for so little.	1
	thank you hyundai you made a luxury car that i can afford.favorite features:way to many to list here, the quality of the car, the luxurious interior, the superb sound system, the power of the engine, and still economical and fun to drive...suggested improvements:8-ways power passenger seat, more room for cd/dvd, remote start and maybe a dynamic radar cruise control	1
	affordable luxury.excellent vehicle!	1
	i've never been a 'label-looker' so i shop for the goodies at a reasonable price.	1
	this car delivers and then some.	1
	the ride is comfortable yet responsive.	1
	the interior is ample.	1
	i'm built like an nfl defensive end and i'm very comfortable.	1
	the amenities are numerous, you get a lot with the standard package.	1
	i have the premium plus and i'm very happy.	1
	the trunk is spacious.	1
	the v-6 290 bhp engine is as smooth as butter on a hot muffin and you can cruise at 80 mph without nary a concern.	1
	an all-wheel drive version would be too sweet!	1
	the stereo system is very nice, audiophile worthy.	1
	a great buy if you're into affordable luxury and you tend not to follow the 'label'.favorite features:the engine is too nice; strong, quiet and responsive.	1
	the ride is smooth and stable with very little road noise.	1
	the safety features are too numerous to even list, but i can say you won't want for airbags.	1
	the car just feels 'solid' and well built.	1
	you can't but a better car for the money...$36ksuggested improvements:offer and all-wheel drive tranny it can onlt improve the sure-footedness of the ride.	1
	make the truck a little deeper.	1
	why pay 60k+.i just got out of my 2002 s-500 sport m benz.	1
	this car has it all!	1
	bmw,lexus,audi,infinit, mbenz all better watch out.	1
	this car is the real deal.	1
	i have always driven high line flagship cars and this is one awesome tight smooth killer looking car.	1
	hyundai has the complete package with this quiet sleek machine.	1
	i highly suggest you give this car a test drive if your considering spending 30k to 40k on a ride.	1
	this is the complete package with out killing your wallet.favorite features:looks, style, options, 'quiet'!!!	1
	it all theresuggested improvements:little wider room in the driver area width.	1
	19inch rims, power trunk, power folding mirrors,	1
	pleasure to drive.i was ready to buy a new civic...but this thing blew me away and forced me to change my game plan.	1
	have owned many cars and currently have a 528i in the garage.	1
	the genesis is an extraordinary vehicle in that it is 'smooth' - driving it is actually almost a pleasure (i drive over 100 miles a day for work).	1
	it is not as tight as the 5 series, but has more power than the 528. refined, many options, very quiet, awesome interior detail.	1
	not sure it will hold it's value over time but jumped on a great lease deal for the premium plus package.	1
	do get the premium package at least on this vehicle or you will lose money when you sell it.	1
	this will not replace a bmw, but sure complements it.favorite features:interior, quite ride, power, transmission, electronics, braking, 18' wheels, sound system (copied 1,000 songs to a usb drive and leave it connected to the aux port), big trunk, and ac/heat system.suggested improvements:flip down rear seat, better bluetooth (needs to be integrated with audio), the badge on trunk, no place for sun glasses, more info on the various elec systems and what they are doing (shock dampening), eng lite btw, you can remove the top part of the ashtray and easily convert it to a change holder	1
	exceeds expectations.with 2,500 miles, the genesis v-* with tech package, has eliminated initial doubt about buying a hyndai.	1
	the car is very quiet, nice interior materials with excellent fit, abundant power and great ride.	1
	have owned new bmw 540, acura tl's and currently have an '07 acura mdx w/tech.	1
	gas mileage on a 1,250 mile trip was 27 mpg at legal speeds, city driving appox.	1
	19-20 mpg.favorite features:lexicon sound system, excellent navigation, very roomy passenger area, large trunk, plenty of power coupled with reasonable gas mileage.suggested improvements:passenger seat should have same power features as driver's seat.	1
	dealership should be separate from traditional hyundai facilities.	1
	the genesis is a serious luxury sedan and should be delivered as such.	1
	a lot of bang for the buck.my wife and i have owned a lot of vehicles before we purchased the genesis; some very good and some bad.	1
	as we age and not into status or snob appeal any longer value,reliability, warranty coverage, and styling are important.	1
	brand cachet was certainly not a consideration when we bought a 2006 sonata lx (loaded v6).	1
	it is a great car for the money.	1
	superb gas mileage for a 235 hp v6 and plenty of good features.so when the genesis made it's debut in the lux arena we bought a white satin pearl 3.8 w/tech package as it came off of the truck.	1
	a year of due diligence in the form of technical research, auto magazine and critical reviews sold me on another hyundai.	1
	what an awesome vehicle!favorite features:actually too many great features with the tech package, but the voice commands to replace your hands is great.	1
	also the quiet cabin is amazing - how did they do that?	1
	the interior is stunning and that came from mb owner!	1
	the suspension system with road sensing ability and stability control...wow!	1
	!suggested improvements:if you get the tech package be prepared for a lot of reading!	1
	so far operation of the nav system has not been real intuitive...for me anyway.	1
	my wife has picked it up quicker.	1
	the passenger seat should have the cooling capability too; a bad oversight.	1
	the quick start guide should be more insightful!	1
	genesis has issues to deal with....after three months, i have found the genesis to be unstable when driving in medium to strong wind, the steering wheel feedback from the highway is to severe and not acceptable, the manual trunk lid operation to be cheap and unacceptable, the lack of electrical front passenger seat settings to be unacceptable.	1
	i continue to study the driver services and reserve any comments on that part at this time.	1
	it is the items mentioned above that upset me as an owner and i find it unacceptable engineering for such a car hyundai hopes to use in competition with bmw, mercedes and lexus.favorite features:performance of v6 and mileage.suggested improvements:address and improve the items mentioned in review.	1
	bmw - mercedes - lexus look out..i am having a ball with my genesis 4.6 with the technologypackage.	1
	bmw, mb & lexus look out for the new kid on the block,hyundai hit a grand slam with this one.	1
	i also have an 06 lexus ls430.	1
	this car is nicer in every way.	1
	looked at the new ls 460 with all the toys and except for a few minor touches the genesis is a steal at 25k less.favorite features:technology package, ride,handling, fit and finish, awesome engine performancesuggested improvements:drivers seat extender, cooled passenger seat,power folding outside mirrors, underseat front storage drawers, bigger console storage, power trunk opener	1
	think about it.	1
	drive it.	1
	do the math..bought my hyundai 4.6 last week.	1
	my first impressions are this is a great car for the price.	1
	if you are reading this and are thinking of buying a bmw, lexus or mb you need to drive this car.	1
	traded our volvo s60 r for this car and i couldn't be happier.	1
	the steering is not as tight as a bmw or mb and the ride is softer but thats okay for my driving habits.	1
	i had a deal for a nicely optioned 2008 bmw 535i that fell through.when all was said and done we financed $17k less for a fully loaded genesis 4.6. more reviews to come as i get more acquainted with car, but at first impression this car is great value for the money.favorite features:value, comfort, ride, sound system, power, too much to list.suggested improvements:chrome rim option, wood package option.	1
	good and bad.i have been impressed since the first ad i saw.	1
	visited the dealership just to see the interior and i was amazed with the fit and finish.	1
	bought a v6 with all the bells and whistles the next day.	1
	2 weeks, 500 miles later i was at the repair center because the stereo was wigging out.	1
	they replaced the $4k head unit which made no difference.	1
	now they are replacing the amp hoping that will fix it.	1
	the alignment has been pulling to the left since i bought it and they supposedly fixed that too.	1
	nope, still pulls left.	1
	beautiful, comfortable, fun car but they still need to work out the kinks.favorite features:suggested improvements:	1
	genesis for a genesis.my company name- genesis, so my wife kept suggesting that i buy... a genesis.	1
	for the fun of it, we did a test drive and fell in love.	1
	the dealership was sensitive to the upscale nature of the car and us being informed buyers.	1
	it has been big fun so far with the head turns (there are only 3-4 in tyler tx (our home) so far.	1
	and we are adding all of the 'wings' extras to personalize it from kai.	1
	the trim is the premium plus with the technology package.	1
	we wanted the v8, but.. they can't keep them on the lot!	1
	i was ok with the power of the v6, but missed some of the trim that is only available on the v8.	1
	but, we're adding most back in.	1
	love it!favorite features:for the first shot out- hyundai got so much right.	1
	i love the quiet ride at 90+mph (shhhh).	1
	attention to serious features.	1
	the sound system- wow!	1
	and i'm picky about sound in my car.suggested improvements:build in the ability to enhance the dis (driver info system) for a fee.	1
	allowing things like graphical weather maps (fed by xm data).	1
	maybe make passenger seat positioning match driver's capabilities.	1
	just bad as in good, head turner.only have had this car a week and love the ride, the speed and great looks.	1
	although the 6cyl has substantial power, the 8cyl is the way to go.favorite features:the sound system is great, roomy trunk, interior well roomy, leather rap and black on black.suggested improvements:fold down rear seats	1
	first three months with genesis v6.we purchased our genesis v6 -- premium pkg.	1
	-- in mid-july this year and have been extremely happy with it to date.	1
	fuel economy is amazing, 20 - 22 in strictly in-town driving, high 20s to low 30s on the highway.	1
	on our first 1100 mile trip with mileage divided 80/20 between interstate and local/city, we averaged 29.4 mpg.	1
	the comfort level is beyond any other car we've owned.	1
	the engine is nearly silent and very strong -- it loafs at 75 mph on the interstate.	1
	would strongly recommend a test drive to anyone who is looking for a very high level of comfort, features, and performance.favorite features:power tilt & telescope steering wheel, 6-speed auto/manual shifter, rear window shade.suggested improvements:add cooled seats as an option to the lower package levels.	1
	best lux car for $$$.very good all around car , nice exterior and interiorfavorite features:lexicon stereo system,navigation,suggested improvements:tune the suspension for more sporty ride, auto turn signal,blind spot sensor,available 19' wheels	1
	seeing is believing.i walked into the hyundai showroom to see the genesis in person as i had only seen it on tv.	1
	i am not sure how long my mouth hung open as i took in the whole car!	1
	eventually i made my way to the sticker and realized this model cost 6k less than other similarly styled cars.	1
	i arrived in a '07 altima se and drove home in the same genesis that afternoon.	1
	the car is so quiet and powerful,a head turner for sure.	1
	everything i have looked for in a car.favorite features:the whole package!	1
	everything blends into one statement, 'i can't decide what i like best'suggested improvements:none, the hit a home run on the first swing with this beauty!	1
	first v8 in virginia beach.bought 2 days ago and drove 200 miles.	1
	thought about buying v6 tech pack, but for only $2k more i decided to wait for v8.	1
	- and glad i waited for v8.	1
	power, solid feel, quiet, quick brake, and yes awesome sound system !	1
	so far i'm loving it.	1
	paint job need to improve.	1
	should have a/c seat on both front seatfavorite features:awesome power - zoom zoom, no need beemer no more.	1
	solid brake, feel so safe.	1
	sound system, just heavenly, the best sound system period.	1
	so quiet inside...suggested improvements:hate pushing little button to open the door.	1
	(with lexus, all i have to do is just pull & open the door) at low speed transmission is a bit jerky (heard this goes away after a month or so) steering is a bit difficult when parking or at low speed i like to have a coin box: not ashtray.	1
	excellent car...!!	1
	!.excellent ride, for normal driving (highway and city drive) it is fantastic.	1
	very comfortable seats, lots of leg room.	1
	fuel economy is decent for the car size.	1
	very happy with my car...!!	1
	!favorite features:lexicon sound system, roomy interior, smooth ridesuggested improvements:maybe fuel economy but you can not expect 4-cylinder fuel economy from this car.	1
	haunting noise.i've had mine a couple of months now and 5000 miles.	1
	two issues,,the speedometer reads about 10% fast.	1
	i hate doing math while i drive and i don't like knowing the odometer showing 10% more miles than actual, not to mention the gas mileage indication is also overstated.	1
	i also hear a faint 'knocking' sound at 1900 rpm just before shifting.	1
	seems to have changed somewhat after the recall reprogram.	1
	dealer has been unable to assist with either problem.	1
	anyone out there having similar issues?favorite features:love the size and ride of this car.	1
	i've owned plenty and this is excellent.suggested improvements:	1
	great ride for the road warrior.i was looking at maxima and cts and heard about the genesis---took a look, a drive and was sold.	1
	throttle is a bit sluggy off the line, but punch it a little and she zooms up to speed with very smooth shifting and great tracking- sound system is superior, hand free phone at hwy speed sounds great to callers, this is a great car and a great value- time will tell if the abundance of plastic parts will hold up and i noticed that the rear wheel wells are lined with some type of fibrous cladding- hope it holds up well to chicago winter- all in all, this has been a joy to drive, and i am constantly getting the thumbs up from other drivers- this car is becoming the hot ride of the season.favorite features:interior design, dash and cabin lights, leather wrapped everything, sound system, handling, braking and overall style- did i mention sound system??	1
	this baby rocks!	1
	hyundai badge is fine with me, this car announces that they have upped the game.suggested improvements:more interior cubby holes, deeper center console, fully fold down back seat, rain drip guides to keep water from drizzling into open trunk, a bit more thigh support for us tall guys would be great	1
	plush,luxurious, and quiet.i'm a jazz man and i love music.	1
	the interior is so quiet it enhances the sound of the already top quality speakers.	1
	i'm riding in first class with a coach ticket.	1
	you can't beat that price.	1
	thanks hyundai for the genesis, i don't have to pay a mortgage payment for a ride in luxury.favorite features:techno package ,the paint job, and the quiet ride.suggested improvements:my suggestion isn't about the car per se but the marketing strategy.	1
	i think comparing the genesis to the lexus,benz,and bmw is stating that they are the benchmark.	1
	make the vehicle that consumers want and let hyundai's name sell for itself stop comparing and set a precedence yourself.	1
	it's time	1
	makes a long commute a joy.this is my first luxury vehicle, just coming out of a 96 maxima se.	1
	test drove the 2009 maxima, 2008 acura tl, and the genesis.	1
	the genesis outclassed them all, so i ended up buying a v6 w/tech package.	1
	the features on this car are an incredible value even though i still shudder when i think about how much higher my loan is on this car.	1
	great ride - kind of similar to my father's 2001 bmw 528i, but more smooth overall.	1
	definitely not as mushy as a lexus, but not as punishing as a beemer.	1
	great looking car, too - i've gotten a lot of rave reviews of the car's looks and disbelief when i tell them 'it's a hyundai.'	1
	all-around excellent car.favorite features:the stereo - beats the bose in my wife's murano hands down.	1
	truly extraordinary.suggested improvements:would like to see the cooled seats added for passenger (my wife is way envious).	1
	best luxury sedan available.the genesis is actually the best stereo you can buy that that delivers you to your destination in fine luxury and comfort.	1
	the balance between comfort and being close to sporty is outstanding.	1
	car & driver and road & track can gig the car for sportiness - not all of us like the taut, firm ride of the bmw's and audi's.	1
	the gas mileage is better than expected, especially cruising at 75. as mentioned by many, dealer support for a luxury car needs to be better.	1
	hyundai does stand by there warranty.	1
	our dealer gave us 2 years worth of oil changes and car washes, and has a very good reputation.	1
	i would advise finding a good dealer when buying.	1
	the value of this luxury car is outstanding.favorite features:stereo!	1
	stereo!	1
	and stereo!	1
	the ride is out of the world, and the backlit dash at night is out of this world.	1
	the warranty is outstanding, and the other luxury sedans can't compete in features and amenities for the price.	1
	and it fits my 6'4' frame, something that lacks in the bmw and mercedes.suggested improvements:back seat needs to be collapsible for complete pass thru.	1
	cool seats on both sides.	1
	much needed dealer training and support to get them into the mentality of how a luxury car should be delivered and give same aspect of value as bmw and others.	1
	overall, this is a grand ride, and hyundai has a hit.	1
	gps 2005 era.i have owned this car for about 2 weeks and what a pleasure to drive.	1
	this car i like very much but have only driven it 600 miles.	1
	it seems to equal everything my bmw 540i did.	1
	my first tank of gas averaged 27.4 mpg now that i like.	1
	of course it's not a v-8 but we have to give a little somewhere.favorite features:pros love the seats with a bad back can still drive for hours.	1
	the backup camera and parking sensors i really as i have new garage doors.suggested improvements:a 2009 car that has a gps that is so out of date.	1
	it fails to find most side streets and i live in a town of 50000. and how about that altimeter i live near sea level maybe theres and adjustment but cant find it, mine starts at 300 feet.	1
	while i wait for an upgrade will have a portable on my dash.	1
	new beginning for hyundai.this is a really nice and best value car.	1
	do not hesitate.	1
	get one.	1
	you will not regret it.favorite features:nice interior.suggested improvements:none	1
	hmg interface.i wanted to respond to spadesman review.	1
	in regards to this hmg interface recall.	1
	i have checked with my dealership and any recall lists found on the internet.	1
	not one mention of a recall.	1
	other than that.....we love our new car.	1
	so far it has lived up to all expectations.favorite features:style exterior and interior performance and ride.suggested improvements:an even lower price lol	1
	impressed with genesis.finished 2007 m45 lease and was interested in new g37 sedan.	1
	g37 isnot available.	1
	heard about genesis and checked them out.	1
	v8'swere just showing up and i was blown away.	1
	car is great!!!	1
	bestautomotive bargain around.	1
	drives like an $80k ls 460 for $42k.	1
	my kids want to disown me but they are away at school and haven't seen this car.favorite features:lexicon 17 speaker sound system bluetooth that everyone who i call says sounds great!!!	1
	!suggested improvements:only pet peeve.	1
	navigation girl voice cannot be shut off completely.	1
	i can't stand the constant interruption to the radio.	1
	hyundai serves notice to lexus.if i remove the hyundai badge on this vehicle, it would be hard to guess who built this vehicle - it is that good.	1
	i love the vehicle.	1
	best value for the money in this segment.favorite features:suggested improvements:wait- i do have one complaint.	1
	can hyundai remove the badge on the back of the vehicle?	1
	i am serious.	1
	i see no reason why they want to identify this as a hyundai.	1
	people's choice - wow!.this is an amazing car.	1
	the leather wrapped dash, ac seats, sound system, adjusting headlights, i could go on and on.	1
	i personally have never owned a luxury car but most of my friends do, and they cannot believe the features this car offers for under 40k.	1
	it is unbelievable how many lexus, bmw and mb driver approach us, telling us how beautiful the car is and cannot believe it is a hyundai.	1
	i would recommend this car to anyone, and do.	1
	i am looking forward to what comes next with hyundai.favorite features:the push button start, ac seats, gps system, driver memory seats, the rain sensor wipers, 18' wheels, rear window sun screen, back up camera and the side mirrors turn down when backing up.suggested improvements:the material use for the headliner seems on the budget side, the rear seats do not fold down, the trunk is opened the water drips from the exterior into the trunk area.	1
	would have been nice to include a truck rug like the sonata.	1
	on-star service.	1
	great buy but ....this car is smooth, fast, and comfortable.	1
	the driver seat is great but these is no cooled seat option on the 3.8. the passenger seat only offers a 4 way adjustment, a major oversight at this level and price point.	1
	a good solid car and buy at about $2000 off msrp.favorite features:blue tooth, xm, driver seat, smooth motor, decent gas mileage 17 town 27 highway, great back seat.suggested improvements:cooled front seats (both), 10 way adjustment on both sides, less wind noise around roof pillars.	1
	good car.this is our company car, and i drove about 5 times (total of about 100 miles) since last month, and this car is very good.	1
	the ride is really smooth and quiet.	1
	the car has lexicon nav, and the bluetooth handsfree sounded so good and clear.	1
	rwd feels really good.	1
	the seats are very comfy.	1
	it is really luxurious and good looking, but 2% lacking to be compared with bmw or mb.favorite features:navigation system and lexicon sound great seats, good start.suggested improvements:driver's side mirror is kinda funky... i do not know why, but it's kinda tilted making me dizzy.	1
	be more creative in design to be unique.	1
	no awd	1
	thrilled then concerned.i bought the car on labor day, loved the car.	1
	everything i had wanted in a car and more.	1
	no problems first 2200 miles, other than transmission jerk off a start thought it would smooth out eventually.	1
	than i learned about recall, hmg interface problem car could lock up at anytime.	1
	on sept 15 i was going up steep incline back wheels hesitated twice from there tranny shifted out of sync.	1
	then burning smell in cabin at acceleration to higher speeds.	1
	car now shimmys in idle.	1
	its at the dealer now they just called me and told me the smelled the firey smoke smell also.	1
	wondering if i made a 40,000 mistake.	1
	i will update with more info as i receive itfavorite features:stereo blutooth,nav, comfort.suggested improvements:add a coin tray remove ashtray.	1
	a whole lot more than price indicates.this car is often compared to bmw 5 series and e series mb's, but it's probably closest in size, engine type, features, and overall class to infiniti's m35.	1
	closest until price is compared.	1
	at about $10k less, it's the automotive bargain of the year, perhaps decade.	1
	like others i looked at and drove bmw, mb, audi, lexus, infiniti and others, all of which are a lot more money.	1
	believe me, none are quieter, more comfortable, more solid feeling, or handle better in every day traffic.	1
	this hyundai is that good.	1
	i can only provide a warning.	1
	do not drive this car, if you are not ready to buy.	1
	you will fall in love with an affordable automotive experience you may not have known existed.favorite features:total lack of outside noise, solid feel, engine power, comfort, and just the right mix of luxury features.suggested improvements:when slid open, the sunroof wind deflector produces quite a bit of wind noise.	1
	the left foot dead pedal is too far forward.	1
	got struck with this.terrible fuel economy 15 in city .dash compartment fixed in one month springs gone bad.	1
	head light assembly fixed due to mist /fog build up after 80 miles only.favorite features:interior and blue toothsuggested improvements:fuel economy and big cars need some sort of park assist as standard.	1
	dash compartment fixed in one month springs gone bad.	1
	good start for first time out!.love this car, performance, handling, style, fit and finish.	1
	chose this car over an acura tl, cadillac cts and saab 9-5.favorite features:its a pleasure to drive.suggested improvements:improvements for future models: body side molding (location?	1
	)passenger seat should be equipped same as drivers.	1
	turn signal indicators in the side view mirror.	1
	folding rear seat.	1
	windshield wiper design needs to be re looked out.	1
	wipers do not flip up unless hood is up.	1
	hyundai hit the nail on the head.we have owned several lexus products since that brands inception in 89 and still have a 2006, sc430 coupe.	1
	the genesis is comparable to the ls and superior to the es series in every way.	1
	our genesis is sterling blue with the tech.	1
	pkg.. we have had the car for a month now.	1
	it feels solid, rides and handles well for its size, is quiet and everyone we know think its a good looking car.	1
	gas mileage is good at 22 city and 28 hi-way on regular fuel.	1
	we saved $$ and have a car that meets and exceeds our desires.	1
	time will only tell if the car stays true to our expectations of trouble free motoring.favorite features:roominess, sound system, technical package features, quiet ride, trunk size, engine response, and handling for the average driver.suggested improvements:tilt feature for the navi screen to keep the glare off the screen from the overhead sun.	1
	electric folding mirrors.	1
	cooled passenger seat.	1
	divers seat extending seat cushion for more thigh support would be nice but not mandatory.	1
	dealership needs to learn how to deliver this car its not an accent.	1
	awesome awesome car.i traded in my clk for this car.	1
	i was looking at the bmw 550, lexus ls640, and the mercedes.	1
	after the test drive in this car, i was sold and bought it on the spot.	1
	performance is in between the lexus (soft) and bmw, just right for me.	1
	lexicon audio system is also pretty awesome.	1
	like the person earlier, i enjoy telling my friends and coworkers that i traded in my mb for a hyundai.favorite features:lexicon audio, smooth quite ride, handling, amazing bargain,suggested improvements:wish the dealerships were more accommodating like other luxury brands.	1
	you need to get one.this car is really nice to drive and looks great.	1
	i had corvette, porsche 911 and have es 330 and ls 460. so, i am telling from the true experiences.	1
	navigation system is very easy to use and great.	1
	everything is simple to set up and blue tooth quality for the phone system is outstanding.	1
	sound quality of the hands-free phone system is beyond my expectation.	1
	i will have to think very hard before i buy another ls 460. dealer needs to improve long way before they catch up with lexus on customer relations.favorite features:hands free blue tooth system- sound is very clear as if you are talking to someone in your living room.	1
	navigation system - better than any navigation system i have used.	1
	sound system - outstanding- better than standard ls 460. i drive this more than my ls 460suggested improvements:dealer service department dealer sales department dealer closing experience	1
	this is a hyundai?.i have had multiple bmw's, a 300e and 3 acura tl's and a 2006 acura rl.	1
	this car hands down is better in almost every category than anything i have driven.	1
	they built a first ever rear wheel drive car that is quiet, has an incredible sound system and everything you would expect in a $60,000 car except that it cost 40. i realize that this is a first year model but as of now,hyundai hit it out of the parkfavorite features:to long to list, push button start, rear wheel drive, 6 speed, 8' nav, heated and cooled driver seat front and rear sensors and back up camera ( are you kidding) and the most incredible stereo i have ever heard.	1
	it does have some things that hyundai needs to address.	1
	see belowsuggested improvements:you build an luxury automobile and leave out a cooled seat for the passenger.	1
	mistake.	1
	i am a huge fan of nav systems and the options available with it, ie, calculator, calender, etc.	1
	the acura has the best nav system hyundai, use the same system.	1
	make the wheels better looking	1
	09 genesis...my wish list.no doubt the best luxury car for the money.	1
	might trade mine in for the v* when it shows up.	1
	my wish list.	1
	back up camera (nav model) needs to come on faster at start up.	1
	genesis logo remains on the screen too long when put in reverse at start up.	1
	i have backed up 10 feet before the screen goes to back up.favorite features:the control knob is great for navigating the xm radio.	1
	a?c drivers seat really pumps the cold air although it should remain on at start up if it was on at shut down.suggested improvements:see above.	1
	make lane departure and active cruise control available.	1
	maybe touch screen nav (i don't think it is on mine?).	1
	paint quality on bumper covers could be better (more coats).	1
	incredible value for $$$!.moved from 2006 azera ltd to this.	1
	other cars currently owned are 2006 bmw 'm' roadster and 2008 infiniti m35.	1
	prior vehicles (since 1994) -- 1998 mercedes sl600, infiniti q45(2), lexus es(300 & 330), a 2002 porsche turbo, and a vw phaeton.	1
	it is our experience that the 2009 genesis is absolutely the best value of any of the above cars - there is no comparison versus what hyundai packs into this vehicle for $40k when fully loaded.	1
	we could have chosen any car we wanted and yet opted for this because of our prior excellent experience with the azera and the fact that the genesis offers far more features and performance for much less money than any of the autos we have owned.favorite features:the fact that genesis has managed to pack in bluetooth, an ipod connector, a 6 cd changer and a nav system into the same vehicle which no other auto maker seems to have figured out how to do yet.	1
	either you get one or another but not all.	1
	in addition, lexus bluetooth is a known nightmare --suggested improvements:trunk on the azera is bigger and the azera's rear seats fold down to facilitate a large pass through.	1
	azera's rear seat room is also much more ample.	1
	but, when compared to lexus or our infiniti, the rear seat room easily beats them all.	1
	in net, about as good as it can get at any price!	1
	hyundai should be at the top of the list.like many others here, i too can't believe i even looked at hyundai, let alone getting one!	1
	i began researching this car early in the year.	1
	i was coming to lease end on a 2006 m45 sport and wanted something much less expensive, uses regular fuel and gets better gas mileage.	1
	i liked the handling dynamics of the m45 and was worried that i took a big step backwards in handling.	1
	not so!	1
	i have found myself taking the same turns and curves in the hyundai that i did with the m45 - at the same speeds - and the hyundai is just as 'planted' as was the m45.	1
	obviously the m was quicker, but i enjoy everything about the hyundai better.favorite features:nice roomy interior, large trunk.	1
	a sound system (lexicon) that you blow you out of the car.	1
	a quiet, smooth ride.	1
	i have only put about 800 miles on it and i am averaging 24 mpg!	1
	i love the navigation system and being able to play mp3's using the usb connection.suggested improvements:there is only one thing that i miss from the m45 that the hyundai does not have: the ability to use the key fob to roll down all the windows as you approach the car.	1
	but, that is the only thing that i miss.	1
	i certainly don't miss the higher monthly payment, higher fuel costs and lower gas mileage.	1
	underpriced luxury.i've owned this car one month with every passing week appreciating the genesis more and more.	1
	the technology features are plentiful and well thought out.	1
	dollar for dollar the genesis equipped with the tech package is a stunning value.	1
	the 290hp v6 engine is more than adequate for enthusiastic driving.	1
	the genesis handling is nicely balanced between sportiness and numbness with just enough road feel to inspire confidence and comfort.	1
	exterior noise does not penetrate the cabin yielding a wonderfully quiet ride.	1
	the 528w 17 speaker lexicon surround sound fills your driving experience with clear, crisp, enriching musical enjoyment.	1
	i considered 335xi, cts4, & es350, but bought a genesis.	1
	wow!favorite features:everything about the technology package, quiet ride, generous interior room front and back, exterior design, roomy trunk, and most of all - the remarkable value.suggested improvements:interior of the trunk is cheaply finished.	1
	expandable map pockets in the front doors have a sharp edge.	1
	passenger side seat should also have the cooling option.	1
	add a power console in the back with a 110v outlet to plug in a laptop or video game.	1
	offer a headrest dvd option.	1
	who needs a bmw 7?	1
	?.i've owned bm'ers since '89.	1
	just had my '05 745 turned in and said goodbye!	1
	the genesis is every bit the luxo ride.	1
	the v6 is faster than my 745 was.	1
	every day i fall further in love with it.	1
	the tech package is great[much easier than the i drive!]	1
	best thing is i can buy two genesis's for the price of a loaded 7!	1
	great car.favorite features:suggested improvements:	1
	perfect!	1
	!.this car is easily the nicest i have owned.	1
	i traded an acura for this and before that i had a mercedes.	1
	frankly, neither of them can compare to this car.	1
	it's superior in every way.	1
	i love telling people i traded my acura for a hyundai.favorite features:ride quality.suggested improvements:none yet.	1
	mission accomplished!!	1
	!.i was following & really looking forward to this motor car, so i bought it!	1
	owned 7 series & was nice compromise, esp.	1
	price.	1
	hyundai's first foray with an all-new rwd platform & v8 engine in this class is impressive.	1
	my car turns heads and i love its understated execution.	1
	has the luxury amenities i need and $$$ to spare.	1
	wish it was sold in a dedicated channel -- i.e., genesis brand -- wouldn't mind stripping the h logo and replacing it with domestic market genesis wings logo (front, back, wheel hub & horn pad)favorite features:easy to drive, smooth, quiet and refined.	1
	love the dis, lexicon audio & driver cooled seats.suggested improvements:wish that the brakes were more on par with vehicles in this class (see bmw b/mark).	1
	prefer a bit firmer handling & less body roll.	1
	would look dynamite with some nice wheels.	1
	agree that pass seat should be cooled as well.	1
	need much better dealer experience & more advertising!!	1
	brand needs enhancement	1
	a luxurious sedan.lease deal was $473/mo.	1
	$2199 upfront.	1
	i am quite satisfied its styling and convenience.	1
	platinum gray metallic has edge at every corner, awesome color.	1
	i really enjoy tight and rich should of lexicon.	1
	a hyundai, you've never seen before.favorite features:lexicon sound.suggested improvements:none.	1
	deja vu of 1989 lexus debut.we wanted to drive a vw passat, chevy malibu, and a genesis on the same day.	1
	went from the vw dealer to the hyundai and bought the genesis.	1
	there was no comparison, the other cars were nice mid size family cars (both with noted nice interiors), but couldn't hold a candle to the genesis.	1
	the big hyundai was quieter, smoother, and so much nicer on the inside and outside than the other two.	1
	it really reminded me of the lexus debut of the ls400 back in '89.	1
	i went to that knowing that this car was supposed to be different than any other toyota ever seen, but was blown away by how nice it really was.	1
	same feelings here.	1
	my wife is very happy with the car too.favorite features:build quality, materials, noise level (none), ride (smooth), features (lots).suggested improvements:dealer experience	1
	i can't believe its a hyundai.i can tell you from owning a bmw, that the hyundai genesis is a very comparable and as high a quality as you can believe.it has great extras with the navigation and bluetooth.	1
	you can't ask for much more in a beautiful car.	1
	great style and luxury.favorite features:love the front gill not having the flying h.suggested improvements:the only bad thing that i can really complain about is the passenger seat is not cooled like the drivers.	1
	great car.a better car in all respects to my 06 lincoln ls.	1
	i chose this car over acura, mb, and buicks i test drove.	1
	the car is a deal even at $33k-$37k for the v6 model.	1
	black and silver look great in this car.	1
	no cassette player- this is 2008. i have a 2000 elantra with over 200k miles and it has been problem free.favorite features:looks, price, interior and seats.	1
	leather covered dashsuggested improvements:it needs better advertising	1
	better than i ever thought it could be!.after turning in my lease and getting bait and switched by the dealer on my infiniti g35, i decided to test drive the genesis, as i had followed since seeing the super bowl ad.	1
	all i can say is i am so glad the folks at infiniti bs'd me on the new payment!	1
	i would have missed out on the best vehicle i have ever driven.	1
	everything from top to bottom is so well done.	1
	if this is hyundai's first attempt at a luxury vehicle, i can wait to see what they come up with next.	1
	this is a $60-70k car with a $35k price tag!favorite features:interior is unreal.	1
	sound system (lexicon) great as well.	1
	love the look and the illumination at night.suggested improvements:standard nav maybe?	1
	nothing else.	1
	hyundai won this battle..i bought my car a couple days ago and i can tell you that this a nice car, i compared this car with the lexus gs 350 and the infiniti g35 and the handling, ride and quietness of this car is superior.favorite features:quality, room, finishsuggested improvements:back sensor with the prem.	1
	+ pkg	1
	awesome ride.i've owned bmw and lexus-my genesis 3.8l is more comfortable and has a firm, quiet, comfortable ride.	1
	plenty of power but great mileage for a 3.8l.	1
	i couldn't be happier-i've researched and waited for this car since i saw it on the super bowl ads.	1
	look out lexus-here comes genesis.favorite features:great exterior styling and luxurious interior with lots of room.suggested improvements:folding rear seats.	1
	genesis rocks!.drove the car for the first time yesterday and all i can say is wow!	1
	never thought driving a hyundai could be so fun or engaging yet so relaxing and assuring.	1
	feels more secure than any bmw i've ever driven definitely more on par with an a8 as far as structural feel.	1
	in performance driving the car has such a neutral feeling and is very balanced weather on or off the accelerator.	1
	i don't think the esp even tried to keep the car in line it just did it on it's own.	1
	this car looks great with tight wheel well gaps (looks like it's already lowered) and sharp tight body lines.	1
	the only thing i might change is the rear tail lamps so it looks less like an infiniti.favorite features:technology packages is really cool don't think the car would be quite as impressive without that.	1
	love the usb port and ipod connectivity in the center console.	1
	this car drives perfect in my eyes if you need more power i am sure the v8 will be plenty for most anyone as i am satisfied with the v6.suggested improvements:i haven't figured out if it can play music over the blue tooth connection yet, in the winter i think headlamp washers might be helpful for us in climate zones that see bad weather.	1
	i hope that the dis system can get updated software to keep up to date with new technology.	1
	hyundai has hit a 10!.i previously was the owner of a 2006 hyundai azera which i traded in for the 2009 hyundai genesis w/tech pkg.	1
	absolutely the best bang for you buck on the market today.	1
	this car has lived up to the hype.	1
	this car is definitely 7 series size, 5 series performance, 3 series price!favorite features:bluetooth, hid adaptive headlights, heated and cooled seats, navigation system, led taillights, lexicon 17 spkr surround sound system, ride, quality, quietness, composuresuggested improvements:not much that's needed on this car.	1
	best hyundai.just took delivery on july 15th.	1
	it's a nice car.	1
	good looks and ride.	1
	nice features.	1
	i average 23mpg mixed driving.	1
	the car has a nice exterior design.	1
	inside is kinda boring.	1
	get the lexicon sound system.	1
	you'll love it (i know i do).	1
	however, the cd changer had to be replaced (stopped working).	1
	the service department is not up to par with other luxury dealers (especially bmw).	1
	loaners are nice when your car is in the shop for a day (the shuttle vans don't cut it).	1
	and for the amount of time i own a car (usually 3 yrs) bmw still has the best warranty.	1
	love the standard maintenance warranty (4yr 50k).	1
	at the end of the day this is still just a hyundai.	1
	but, overall i'm happy with the car.favorite features:sound systemsuggested improvements:navi missing some features the other luxos have.	1
	better cabin.	1
	it's a little bland.	1
	and how about a front passenger cooled seat as well (and rear heated seats).	1
	don't skimp.	1
	giant killer.what a great car!!	1
	makes you totally rethink the brand.	1
	the interior is a lot lot better than what the pics show in the web or in magazines.	1
	the fit and finish is very good and the lexicon really is amazing!!	1
	i thought the steering would feel too light as a lot of bigger luxury cars tend to be, but i was pleasantly surprised...it's no sports sedan in feel but it has a good amount of resistance and good on center feel.	1
	only gripe is the bluetooth, no wheel mounted controls and does not come through the cars existing speakers.	1
	go test drive one with an open mind and you will soon forget all that you thought was a hyundai.	1
	i give it an a.favorite features:good overall looks inside and out.	1
	very comfy and roomy interior.	1
	lexicon sound system.	1
	good looking wheels for a luxury sedan.	1
	rear wheel drive.	1
	value.suggested improvements:bluetooth...no steering wheel mounted controls and does not come through audio system speakers.	1
	change the brand to genesis, hyundai name still carries too much negative baggage.	1
	seven series killer.believe it or not i once believed that hyundai was an inferior brand, after buying my genesis and driving the car for the last week i must say that anyone in the large performance luxury market would be foolish not to buy this car every aspect of this automobile screams luxury from the twelve way power seat to the throaty almost three hundred horsepower v-6 i have owned a diverse selection of luxury cars and i have to say i have never been more impressed with a vehicle.	1
	i am also surprised how many people break their neck looking at the car if you are considering a new luxury car drive all others first and then drive the genesis.	1
	better yet just drive it first then take it homefavorite features:stunning european designsuggested improvements:no complaints here	1
	hyundai genesis.ride is busy.. reflecting a stiffer suspension than the azera.	1
	rear seats do not fold.	1
	no passenger seat memory.	1
	rear leg room limited for a 115 in wheelbase.	1
	interior is nicely finished.	1
	cassette tape player not included.favorite features:compact stylingsuggested improvements:see above	1
	genesis is an excellent car!.the hyundai genesis is an outstanding car and performs very well.	1
	this is a luxury sedan that is powerful, quiet, luxurious, attractive and priced very competitively.	1
	handles very well w/ a sporty ride.	1
	great fuel efficiency for a 3.8l v-6 engine.	1
	the instrumentation is great and the sound system is top of the line.	1
	i compared the mercedes e- class, lexus 350, jaguar xf, infiniti m-35/45 and bmw 5 series before i chose this vehicle.	1
	i think its equal or superior in most aspects, yet was less costly than all of the other vehicles i compared.	1
	great value.	1
	hyundai has a real winner in my opinion!favorite features:styling, instrumentation, sound system, seating comfort, quiet ride, engine performance / power, fuel efficiencysuggested improvements:	1
	unbelievable.this car is truly unreal.	1
	i did all my research, drove all the cars on my list and hands down the genesis blew the competition away.	1
	i am extremely happy with my brand new hyundai!favorite features:quality of materials, transmission, ridesuggested improvements:none at this time.	1
	1st hyundai genesis.today i got the new genesis, the first one sold in the u.s according to the factory the dealership got them from.	1
	the interior is as awesome as promised.	1
	i am 6'3' and my 6'2' son fits behind me with plenty of room.	1
	i got the premium plus package and everything is awesome.	1
	black on black with metallic paint, and i am happy to say that it will be possible to debadge the car.	1
	like i said the interior is spacious and comfortable with plush leather.	1
	xm and bluetooth and 6-disc changer, the 14 speaker lexicon system is awesome.favorite features:xm, size, speaker's, looks, bluetoothsuggested improvements:more cars, only 10 max will be sold per dealership this year, but that just means the car will remain very exclusive for the next year or so	1
	2009 genesis review.this is a great looking car.	1
	i got lots of compliments.	1
	but the car simply has the worst ride of any vehicle i've owned.	1
	my toyota camry rides way better.	1
	i'm going for the second time to the dealer to see if anything can be done, but i'm not confident.	1
	i can't see myself driving this car for three years-i'd get rid of it tomorrow if i could.	1
	very, very disappointing.favorite features:looks.suggested improvements:fix the suspension.	1
	apparently there are quite a few people out there who have the same problem.	1
	satisfied with purchase.so far, so good with the car.	1
	i didn't really know what to expect with a korean brand car.	1
	but the genesis has proven itself capable to me.	1
	the car is very beautiful, a little derivative.	1
	but most people think that it is a mercedes, which is a compliment.	1
	the dealership where i purchased it was definitely an interesting experience.	1
	some of the team members were a bit oblivious to the features of the 3.8. but i finally got a guy to help me out with some important questions.	1
	financing the car was good.	1
	got it for about 424/month with 1.9 apr.favorite features:sound system is a plus.	1
	leather dash is very pleasant to live in while driving.	1
	the back seats are extremely roomy for the kids.	1
	the kids are now spoiled and act like business clients.	1
	really, really safe.	1
	8 airbags and that 5 star safety rating.suggested improvements:extra cup-holders would be a nice adjustment.	1
	women need to be accounted for.	1
	like, more storage cubbies for make-up and people stuff.	1
	more cuteness in the interior.	1
	it's nice but.i have owned a lexus ls 430 for six years.	1
	when i test drove and purchased the genesis 4.6, it was compared to lexus and bmw.	1
	my genesis has several little problems that my dealer claims is on all the genesis cars and they can't fix them.	1
	plus the programming of many of the car's functions leaves alot to be desired.	1
	i agree the the car has excellent performance but a car that frustrates you every time you drive it is not a pleasure.	1
	perhaps i expect too much by thinking that a $40,000 auto should have all the bugs worked out before it is put on the market but i don't think so.	1
	perhaps i am spoiled by lexus but relatively speaking, this car does not meet my expectations of $40,000 carfavorite features:the power and pickup is great and the braking in excellent.	1
	the back up camera is excellent on the large gps screen.suggested improvements:fix the bugs and get the fixes to the dealers.	1
	improve the defrost function.	1
	reprogram the computer to get rid of all the stupid things the car does.	1
	don't put a car on the market until the programming is complete and bug free.	1
	after 40,000 miles.i am not sure how many drivers have reached 40,000 miles with the genesis, but i have.	1
	i driven it at speeds of 100+ miles per hour a few times and taken alot of long distant trips without a problem.	1
	this car really performs well in curves, it makes you sit back an enjoy the ride.	1
	i have added 20in tires and rims which has added alittle road noise.	1
	my only fault with the car is, i should have two in my driveway...hooha!	1
	!favorite features:stereo system, drivers seat, and the stance (look from the front)suggested improvements:a chrome lower front grill.	1
	outstanding car.hyundai has done just about everything right on the genesis.	1
	there have been complaints about the ride.	1
	i find that tire pressure is the problem (and maybe the dunlop tire as well).	1
	the techs at the dealer or tire store will put the tire pressure up to 35 psi.	1
	this will produce a rough ride.	1
	if you reduce the pressure to 32-33 psi, the ride will be about like a mercedes e class.	1
	i find this to be about right.	1
	30 psi would be even better but the low tire pressure system will signal low tire pressure if it gets below 30 and you have to run it up to 35 to reset the system and get the low pressure message off.	1
	buy a good tire pressure gage and set the pressure yourself.favorite features:looks, power, 6 speed auto transsuggested improvements:could use more cup holders.	1
	16 months of fun and satisfaction.yes, people make faces: 'a hyundai?'	1
	but i did four months of research and bought it for the value and haven't regretted it yet.	1
	i also got lucky to have the wings on the trunk.this car kept every promise from riding comfort,road handling, to exceptional sound, and all the electronics are working very well with the small navigation button.	1
	i had mercedes and still have a bmw; genesis compares extremely well.	1
	you have to go into bmw 700 category and the 550 mercedes class, which will cost accordingly.	1
	and yes i had more than a dozen people ask me if it is a bentley (because of the wings in the back).favorite features:style, ride, and comfort in driving, listening to lexicon, and the way the car is put together.	1
	the many electronic extras that are standard with the tech package.	1
	acceleration is incredible and beats lexus gs 450 and vw gti (of course we tested it).suggested improvements:25 mpg is it, not bad but of course they claim 25 to 30. otherwise i couldn't think of anything for $40 k out the door with everything.	1
	the best car i have ever owned!i also own a lexus and a benz.	1
	this car is better than both.	1
	i would match this car with any car on the market that costs between 30k and 50k.	1
	i have own my genesis for over a year and have had no issues with it.	1
	it beats both my lexus and benz hands down.	1
	benz imo is over rated; i have had nothing but expensive problems with it since i purchased it new.	1
	the lexus was an excellent car, but it is the little things that get too you.favorite features:design and performance; and very inexpensive to operate compared to either my benz or my lexus.suggested improvements:higher gauge metal body!	1
	best performance-value ratio.after four months of ownership, i am extremely pleased with the car.	1
	the feel and comfort of the car are excellent.	1
	the highway ride and acceleration are super.	1
	the overall quality matches or surpasses that of most luxury sedans on the market -- except that genesis costs thousands of dollars less.	1
	looks great inside and out.	1
	easily, one of the top 'performance - value' vehicles on the road.favorite features:stereo system, smooth and powerful acceleration, design (interior and exterior).suggested improvements:improve gas mileage(incorporate green technology) -- luxury vehicles can be environmentally friendly.	1
	(still not bad for a car of this size.)	1
	some may prefer a 'softer' ride.	1
	love this car...after 9 months of ownership, i have found this car to be everything promised.	1
	the interior and exterior styling are suburb.	1
	i have experienced no mechanical or other type problems.	1
	the car is very comfortable on long trips, although i sometimes prefer a cushier ride to the more stiff sport suspension on this vehicle.	1
	my only 2 complaints are the lexicon sound system is not as good as it is cracked up to be in my opinion and the blue tooth interface is not as compatible as it claims to be with certain phone models.	1
	nonethless, i receive weekly compliments on the car and believe it is one of the best values on the market today.favorite features:exterior styling, performance, gas milage, tire pressure monitoring system, and the xm radio.suggested improvements:more storage compartment space in the cabin.	1
	5 days of ownership and loving it!	1
	!wonderful car, i'm very happy with my purchase.	1
	makes it seem like a waste to purchase a bmw, mercedes, lexus or infiniti for thousands more!	1
	i have the genesis badge/wing on the trunk, and people ask me is that a 'bentley'.	1
	looks and performs stride for stride with the premium luxury automobiles mentioned before.	1
	well worth the $42k..bmw 550 will perform better but at a $25,000 premium.	1
	one of my co- workers owns one, and it is not worth the extra $$$.	1
	i took him for a ride in the genesis, and he couldn't believe it was a hyundai and the price i paid for it!favorite features:the ride, style, interior & exterior, cost, electronics, pretty much the whole genesis experience...suggested improvements:have the germans build a steering columns for the genesis...german cars you just 'point and go'...new 2010 equipment (electronic parking brake, auto cruise, etc.)	1
	should have been included in the 2009 models..include air cooled passenger seat..include genesis emblems for wheels, rear, front grille..	1
	what an amazing value!after much research and test driving i bought the genesis 4.6 with tech package.	1
	i was a bit hesitant because the ride was a bit more firm and sporty than what i was used to with my avalon.	1
	after 2 months, i have to say the ride is no longer an issue and i prefer the suspension in the genesis to my 'couch on wheel' ride i had before.	1
	i still can't believe i paid $36.7k plus t&t.	1
	it's just silly to think people pay $50 and $60k for comparable vehicles.	1
	i also got the wing emblems on wheels, trunk and steering wheel.	1
	it looks fantastic and i've received many stares and compliments on the car.	1
	the es350 was the only other alternative, but it is much smaller and has a dated interior.favorite features:the electronics in this car are fantastic - great response time on the nav, xm and all other features.	1
	it plays mp3's from a usb stick - no ipod required.	1
	love the exterior and interior styling, the quality of the leather interior, and the use of chrome accents inside and out.suggested improvements:ride could be improved - there has to be a better compromise on maintaining sportiness and handling with a bit more ride comfort.	1
	really like it.my wife and i have owned our genesis for 4 months and remain very pleased.	1
	we test drove lexus, avalons, lincolns and 3 genesis.	1
	one genesis test drive was for more than an hour.	1
	we were not surprised by the stiffness of the genesis ride.	1
	highway ride and quietness are excellent.	1
	firm ride in town lacks something to be desired but my wife does not mind.	1
	purchasing experience was good.	1
	please do not drive up the cost by having 'genesis only' dealerships.	1
	i do like the performance, interior and exterior styling and sound system.	1
	a great car to drive.favorite features:fit & finish,quietness, autowipers, trunk space, interior/exterior styling, sound system, handling, performance, price and warranty.	1
	a fine fun to drive automobile.suggested improvements:a little more padding in the seat would be nice.	1
	cd player should read info on cds.	1
	illuminate the buttons on the rear view mirror.	1
	improve fuel economy.	1
	on a 3400 mile trip we averaged 24.6mpg.	1
	note: for most of the trip we had a headwind and drove 70+.	1
	excellent car.we love this genesis and would buy another!	1
	i have had several nice compliments and folks wanted to know more about it etc.favorite features:ride,power,and comfortsuggested improvements:more colors to pick from.	1
	buyer beware.okay, so i was one of those extremely pleased individuals who purchased a genesis and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, and rolled my eyes at bad reviews.	1
	but my electrical system hasn't been right since i drove it off the lot.	1
	so just be aware that the system is intricate, and new, so when things start going wrong, you may find yourself visiting the dealership many times to give them a chance to get it right.	1
	i've been at least 6 times since i purchased the new car, and it's still not fixed.	1
	the difficult part is that in fairness, it's a car that gives a great driving experience, when it works the way it's supposed to work.	1
	be aware - bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs.favorite features:interior design little road noise power exterior design rear view camera voice activated controls sound system (really, really fabulous)suggested improvements:smart cruise control touch screen navigation(think that's coming for 2010 models) get the electrical bugs worked out.	1
	superb choice.i had been evaluating several new sport sedans over a period of 11 months prior to selecting my genesis.	1
	specifically, i tested the bmw 535, audi a6, cadillac cts and mercedes e350.	1
	i have also owned lexus vehicles.	1
	i was leaning toward the bmw but had not tested the genesis during this time span.	1
	i had established a price range and didn't want to go north of $70k.	1
	after ten minutes in the genesis there was no doubt in my mind that this car was the best of the group.	1
	the handling, spaciousness, quietness and overall good feeling left me with the impression that the other brands were over priced.	1
	the difference in the overall savings gives me free fuel and insurance over the 36 month lease.favorite features:handling is superb for a 4000 lb.	1
	vehicle.	1
	the console selector knob helps keep my eyes on the road without having to touch a screen or find a button on the dash.	1
	this is one solid vehicle and after 6 months i can't find one fault to register a wish or complaint.suggested improvements:none.	1
	forget the gps.great fuel economy.	1
	easy to drive both city and highway.	1
	sound system good.	1
	proximity warning very helpful.	1
	would buy another one but without gps.	1
	gps terrible !	1
	hand held units much better.	1
	not enough words to describe how bad the system is.	1
	don't get that accessory, buy a hand held.favorite features:fuel economy, appearance, pep, seat comfort, heated, cooled seats.suggested improvements:put a decent gps in it.	1
	improve ride, leave the 'sporty feel' to the coupe.	1
	i never thought...having driven 3 bmws, an infiniti, and an acura rl, i never thought i would own a hyundai.	1
	now i have two - a genesis 4.6 and a veracruz limited.	1
	they obviously are doing something right.	1
	i tend to look at my new cars very closely - the only issue i could fine with this vehicle was that one tire was 1 pound under inflated.	1
	i think i can live with that.favorite features:audio system interior & exterior styling and interior space usb / iphone interface handling and performancesuggested improvements:would like to see nav system improved to include locations that can be found via the voice recognition system.	1
	driver information system seems to be only 'adequate' - would like to see more information available.	1
	awd would be a good option that i would like to have next time.	1
	13,000 mile update.this is an update of my original review.	1
	i have the 3.8 v6 with premium package and all available options.	1
	i've had the car for 9 mths and it now has 13k miles of semi- aggressive highway & city driving experience.	1
	i still love this car!	1
	and here's the best part, since i've owned the car the only service required has been scheduled maintenance.	1
	no rattles, no signs of wearing, and still fun to drive.	1
	in the snow (we had an 18 in.	1
	snow storm last week), it handled better than expected.	1
	i did struggle up a steep hill that wasn't plowed well (4' of loose snow on road) but otherwise the car did fine.	1
	i don't have any issues sports handling - but the ride could be smoother.	1
	buy this car!favorite features:i love the lexicon sound system - and the tech package features.	1
	the car is still whisper quiet and the handling is superb.	1
	the seats are very comfortable for long drives and the zoned heating and ac (front and back) is outstanding.	1
	the luxury interior is outstanding in appearance, fit, & finish.suggested improvements:the 2010 model has some of the improvements including adaptive cruise control, improved suspension, and touch screen tech pkg.	1
	would also like bluetooth to import phone book, fold down back seat, and blindspot alerts.	1
	none of these suggestions would stop me from buying this car again.	1
	go buy one!	1
	best buy on four wheels.yes it's a hyundai!	1
	i must repeat that phrase at least once every day.	1
	no one can believe that this is a hyundai.	1
	even the guys at big-o tire asked if they could take pictures.	1
	the same happened when i had the windows tinted.	1
	in short, i have purchased 1-2 new cars a year since 1990- all brands and makes from corvettes to camrys.	1
	with 5 cars in the garage we have a choice, and without fault the car that is out of the garage first is the genesis.	1
	personally, i like the gas mileage of the v6.	1
	hwy 28 mpg and 23-24 mixed driving.	1
	very impressive for a full size family sedan.	1
	(and no- i don't work for hyundai or any car biz.. i always wonder about other people that write these things :)favorite features:the ride and visibility are unsurpassed.	1
	the xm stereo is outstanding.suggested improvements:not much.	1
	adjustable sun visor.	1
	not for snow!it has been more years than i can remember-since i drove a non-front-wheel (or all wheel drive)car in snow!	1
	i absolutely love my genesis!!!	1
	but when it snows - i will keep it in the garage and use my wife's honda civic!	1
	sorry senior.after a few months non repairable transmission shifting problems.	1
	drivers seat cushion repaired four times.	1
	dunlop tires edges wear causes noise and vibration.	1
	sunlight blocks nav screen and back up camera.	1
	window washers only spray lower half of windshield.	1
	when starting the car in moist weather half the windshield fogs up.	1
	windshield wiper blade still rubs even after being replaced.	1
	no light under hood.favorite features:push button starter.	1
	smooth flow of power.head lights.	1
	low pressure tire warning.suggested improvements:have complained many times to hyundai customer service about transmission -tires-seat cushion-etc.dealer has been outstanding but hyundai customer service really means nothing.	1
	love my genesis v8.i own a bmw 525i and a mercedes e350, i have more fun and get more looks when i am in my genesis.	1
	the ride is smooth and quiet, power is plentiful, comfort outstanding, all kinds of bells and whistles, done very tastefully.	1
	i recommend this car to anyone who is looking for german performance at a beer budget.favorite features:performance,interior quality, comfort and clean looks..suggested improvements:genesis emblems factory installed.	1
	love my genesis.i only have 2000 miles on my genesis, however this car is so much fun to drive.	1
	the ride is comfortable and quiet, acceleration is superb for a big car, and the price is right.	1
	i also own a benz e 350,a bmw 525i and a hyundai gx350.	1
	everyone in my household wants to take the genesis.	1
	no regrets..favorite features:acceleration, interior, quite ride, comfortsuggested improvements:blue tooth download of phone book.	1
	attention grabber, substance & style.i bought my black genesis 3.8 v6 premium pkg 7 months ago, and honestly i still have people (ok, all have been guys) ask me what it is i'm driving -- at gas stations, grocery store lots, at traffic lights, you name it.	1
	it truly does look like a 7-series bmw, or a s-series mercedes, but many mistake it for a maybach or even rolls because i opted for the 'genesis wings' logo vs. the hyundai 'h'.	1
	i love the lines of the car, especially in profile, and the performance matches the sweet, unique looks and all the hype you hear!	1
	tremendous value for a truly luxurious sedan.favorite features:great body lines, elegant interior, punch acceleration, lithe body lines (especially in profile), and an amazingly rich and clear sound system.suggested improvements:if you live in a snowy clime, you really need to know how to drive a rear-wheel in snow (i start in manual mode 2nd gear, downshift, etc).	1
	i think it's more a function of the dunlop performance tires than the car, though -- it rides so tight on a dry road!	1
	hyundai genesis 3.8 v6 tech/premium pack.overall excellent product; however, beware as there are subtle issues such as alignment (pull to left or right) and very bumpy ride.	1
	i recommend that you invest in cars that do not come with defects and have higher resale value.	1
	also, company needs to stand behind its products and learn from toyota's recent recall.favorite features:car appearance and warranty.suggested improvements:steering system, fix alignment issue and bumpy ride and outstanding customer service.	1
	shifting problems.my 2009 genesis shifts from 1st to 2nd gear at about 4 miles an hour from a dead stop causing it to bog slightly, making it very irritating every time you start off.	1
	i tried to get hyundai to do something about it but they said that even though if shifted quick that it was within their specs.	1
	the problem is that they are looking a numbers and i am driving the car daily, stopping and starting probably 25 times a day.	1
	it is very frustrating but there is nothing i can do about it.	1
	a pleasant surprise.great ride - with a luxurious interior and classy simple exterior look.	1
	got a call from a friend who drove by asking if i bought a bentley...the genesis emblems will do that.	1
	everyone loves this car...have had 3 new infinitis since 1998 starting with the q45 and this car does not disappoint.	1
	after test driving lincoln mks, the cc, and lexus, the decision was easier than i expected.	1
	for the value, luxury and drive, and watching the road test comparisons on youtube against the bmw 5 series, i was sold.	1
	oh and the warranty and safety features didn't hurt.favorite features:the look and feel of the car, and the powerful v8.	1
	also the than advertised mileage - which was a surprise.suggested improvements:thicker floor mats for driver, awd would make this car a perfect 10 for me at this time.	1
	improve the mileage even more.	1
	finally a hyundai i like.after trading in my 2006 sonata for a 2006 azera and having the azera for 3 a half years of misery , i finally got hyundai i love.	1
	the car is the best bang for your buck when you don't want to over spend for a luxury car .favorite features:the ride quality and the premium leather seats.	1
	the lexicon system is not bad just wish it had more amps.	1
	the acceleration of this engine wow.	1
	the quietest car i have ever owned.suggested improvements:lexicon with more punch.a spot to put your glasses in.	1
	a fold down rear seat.	1
	power fold in mirrors was on my azera.	1
	sunvisor extentions to block the sun.	1
	super value in a nice package.i have driven this car on trips and primarily around town and on country road regularly.	1
	it handles with amazing tightness in cornering and traction.	1
	very little if any loss of traction under full acceleration even in corners.	1
	the car came with sport 5000 m tires and i notice that the trad wear is somewhat excessive as this tire carries a 60,000 mile warranty on tread wear.	1
	the car though a little heavy weight wise handles with the agility of a much smaller lighter car.	1
	i have owned 3 bmw's; a 3 and two 5 series cars, two infiniti autos, one a 38 series and one a 45 series and numerous cadillac autos; this car is extremely well made, plus handles better than many cars not comparable !favorite features:the driver amenities, and ease of learning the use of the navigation and sound system which is without match !	1
	the interior quality and exterior fit and finish is superior to lexus and many other brands more expensive.	1
	acceleration is without match both low and high end along with the handling !suggested improvements:i can't think of anything other than the cup holder arrangement in the console as being a drawback and hell who needs a cup anyway !	1
	nice luxurious car.when my husband told me that he wanted a luxury sedan, i was worried about the cost.	1
	we test drove many cars and really liked the audi a4.	1
	as we continued to look, we stopped at the hyundai dealer to see what they had in the line of luxury sedans and were shocked to find the genesis.	1
	a gorgeous car at such a low price!!	1
	one test drive and we were sold...done deal!	1
	we have already put 12,000 miles on it and have zero regrets.	1
	i do recommend re-badging this car.	1
	i found some neat 'winged' genesis badges on ebay (very much like the bentley badge), pulled the hyundai badge off the rear and replaced with the new, and added a badge to the front hood.	1
	makes the car look more elegant.favorite features:exterior styling.	1
	this car really does turn heads.	1
	especially with the badges that i put on it.	1
	many ask what kind of car it is.	1
	they are very surprised when i tell them it's a hyundai!!	1
	!suggested improvements:the lexicon sound system had 17 speakers including 2 sub-woofers.	1
	i would think that i could make it sound better than it does.	1
	also, the rear view mirrors tilt down when you put it in reverse which makes it hard to see what is actually behind you while backing.	1
	a happy owner.after owning 2 elantras and 3 sonatas and having no reliability problems and next to none other problems with hyundai cars i got a genesis 3.8l w/premium pkg.	1
	build quality and comfort exceed anything i've ever owned and i've owned lincoln an mercedes.	1
	performance, considering the 3.8 is hauling around a 2 ton vehicle, is nothing short of amazing!	1
	all surfaces inside have that certain luxury quality look and feel.	1
	all exterior panels fit evenly and the doors, trunk and hood close with authority.	1
	everything works as intended and expected.	1
	in town gas mileage can be no so hot at 16-17 at the highest, but on a run back from omaha one day i got 29 which was a pleasant surprise.favorite features:the performance, stop, go, cornering.	1
	how it sits looking as though it is hunkered down over the wheels.	1
	the stereo, 3 level heated seats, seat comfort, ride comfort.	1
	the cool interior lighting.suggested improvements:lose the one push on one push off parking brake.	1
	a hand or standard foot brake would be better.	1
	the position of the drivers seat belt latch is hard for me to reach.	1
	a 2 inch extension would be nice.	1
	exterior design elegant but a bit anonymous.	1
	i couldn't put up with the ride comfort.i was excited to buy this well priced loaded 6 cylinder genesis.	1
	i loved the interior styling, sound system, and navigation system.	1
	i tended to overlook the ride comfort when i test drove it.	1
	what a mistake.	1
	it was the worst riding car i ever owned.	1
	unless you were on completely smooth roads, the car would bounce back and forth quite a bit.	1
	after 3 months, i took a big loss and traded it in for a used deville.	1
	am i the only one to be bothered by the ride comfort of the genesis?favorite features:interior styling, sound system, navigation systemsuggested improvements:harsh ride.	1
	could add a few upgrades.having traded in a lexus ls430 i was hoping for a comparable car.	1
	this model needs more storage space in glove compartment and center consul.	1
	it needs 3 way seats for small passengers.	1
	it needs wheel locks.	1
	it needs flatter response when cornering.	1
	needs more leg room in rear.	1
	a 7 speed transmission would help mileage for longer trips.	1
	otherwise, the car seems to be a good value with good performance.favorite features:large trunk, driver seat adjustments, sound system.suggested improvements:storage space in front and better seat for passengers.	1
	wheel locks.	1
	operating manual needs to be condensed and more specific.	1
	worst gear shifting i've seen.the car is ok except for the transmission.	1
	this car has a six speed transmission and it searches and searches ans still finds the wring gear.	1
	when going up a hill and you need to accelerate a little it will jump two gears instead of one.	1
	the transmission will also not 'release' when you slow to stop.	1
	i can't coast in it.	1
	it is really an aggravating car to drive.	1
	other than that it is a nice car or in other words, 'other than that mrs. lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?'	1
	this inability to find the correct gear also has an affect on gas mileage.favorite features:outstanding appearance both inside and out.suggested improvements:better shifting sequence by transmission.	1
	bad bad ride.	1
	avoid it.i have leased this care now for 1 year, and i have 2 years to go.	1
	the ride is just horrible.	1
	it actually makes you sea sick on the roads.	1
	the stero is great, the interior looks great.	1
	seats are comfortable, but you buy a car to drive, and it is the worst riding car i have ever had.	1
	i can hardly wait to get rid of it.	1
	if i wouldn't take a big loss, i'd get rid of it this afternoon.favorite features:interior, stereo system is awesome.suggested improvements:improve the ride.	1
	its horrible.	1
	big problems.we have had the car just over one year.	1
	this past week while driving, the entire car shut down.	1
	the dealer towed the car and come to find out the rear engine seal failed; they still don't have a clue as to why.	1
	they are putting a brand new engine in it at no cost to me so their service has been a+.	1
	they are sending the old engine back to the company to investigate.	1
	their engineers and mechanics could not find a reason for the failure, that is why the old engine is being returned to their factory to try and find out why.	1
	they gave me excellent service but my problem is; i no longer trust the car.	1
	as soon as i get it back i'm selling it.	1
	if it happened once it could happen again!!	1
	!	1
	sorry senior.transmission still clunks and jerks.	1
	no cure available.	1
	hyundai buy back plan worthless.	1
	dealer has been very very cooperative.	1
	sunlight blocks out nav screen and back up camera.	1
	both front seats need more thigh support.	1
	no light under hood.	1
	bad blind area when drivers seat is all the way back.	1
	drives like a truck rides like a brick.	1
	fist year deprecation more than 35%.favorite features:push button starting.	1
	performance.	1
	gas mileage.	1
	rear window screen.	1
	nav system.	1
	soft feel and effective brakes.suggested improvements:cannot raise wiper arms to remove ice or snow.	1
	dunlop tires have no traction on very cold snow days.	1
	you can not modulate power to the rear wheels this caused me to spin out.	1
	dunlop tires have shallow tread and to much road feel.	1
	window washers only spray lower windshield.	1
	can not be adjusted.	1
	85,000 miles and here is the reality.this car either drifts dramatically or catapults, hard on tires my receiver went bad hyundai wants 1900 won't do a dam thing for me called lexicon what a joke voice activation also connected to receiver bottom line hyundai says i use the radio too much.	1
	not all bad though still have 15,000 mile warranty on power train yippee!	1
	long-term update.ride quality appears to be the most negative comment by owners.	1
	replacing the dunlop oem tires with pirelli pzero neros ) at (13,000 miles) essentially solved any harsh ride issues that i had with car.	1
	the change in the handling and ride quality has been simply amazing.favorite features:all comments made in my original evaluation remain.	1
	navigation stands out with simplicity to use as compared to my acura mdx.	1
	the genesis is an outstanding value and i would purchase again with hesitation.suggested improvements:as previously noted, made the passenger seat comparable to drivers seat in adjustments and the cooling feature.	1
	better than e500.this car beats the 2005 mb e500 i previously had, hands down.	1
	simplicity of controls, power, navigation, stereo, seat comfort, gas mileage without premium gas.	1
	absolutely no problems whatsoever.	1
	dealer is great when i take it in for service, oil change and rotation of tires.	1
	you cannot buy a better car.	1
	buy this car, you won't go wrong.favorite features:controls, navigation, cooled seats, acceleration, ride, exterior appearance and build quality.suggested improvements:better lip on trunk.	1
	if you open the trunk while it is raining, whatever is in the trunk will have water draining onto it.	1
	excellent automobile.nothing is perfect but in my opinion there is not a better automobile for the money nor one worth the cost of the difference up the price scale.	1
	mine cost $32,600 and it's flawlessly built and has been completely problem free for the last two years.	1
	everyone notices it and comments glowingly about its interior and exterior look.	1
	the more i drive it the more i like it.favorite features:quietness, confident driving characteristics, good looks, power and fuel economysuggested improvements:replace the rather hard dunlop tires with a more compliant tire - i chose continental extreme contact-dw - they are remarkably better handling and responsive, quieter and softer riding, plus lower rolling resistance and long wearing.	1
	not quite what a luxury car should be.i leased the genesis when it first arrived at the dealers.	1
	i will be turning the car in soon and finding a replacement due to some issues i have with the car.	1
	the stereo has terrible sound quality.	1
	they claim this car has the same stereo as a roll royce.	1
	well i guess the stereo sound is bad in a rolls too.	1
	the car has plenty of power but has a problem putting the power to the road.	1
	the six-speed transmission has a shift point from 1st to 2nd right in the middle of a turn from a stop that makes the car 'jump' and engage the traction control.	1
	the stereo only supports 1st and 2nd generation ipods.	1
	i've never been able to use my ipod.	1
	if they fix some of these issues, maybe i'll buy one.favorite features:the car is beautiful.	1
	the seats are comfortable and the interior layout is good.	1
	the trunk is spacious.	1
	the bluetooth works well.	1
	it gets good gas mileage.	1
	this car is capable of using regular gas instead of premium like other luxury cars.suggested improvements:fold down rear seats 4th and 5th generation ipod support better stereo sound improved traction control power outlet in the rear seat area needs an awd option.	1
	good car for your money.i like the ride and handling of this car.	1
	the leather finishing is fantastic.	1
	adaptive lights are great and the sound system is great also.favorite features:cooled seats, sound system, proximity entry, strong xenon lights, etc.suggested improvements:none.	1
	love my genesis.i love this car.	1
	it is unmistakably the most beautiful car i have ever owned.	1
	it turns heads every day and the color (cabernet) is gorgeous.	1
	most of the complements i get are on the color.	1
	the paint is flawless even after 7 months of 95 degree, blazing sunlight.	1
	the performance is impressive and the interior, quiet and comfortable.	1
	i love the sound system and the tech package works great.	1
	i had to have the console control replaced under warranty and there was a problem with an emission control part that was also covered under the warranty.	1
	other than those minor inconveniences, i really am happy with my car.	1
	my only complaint with the car, is the ride.	1
	it rattles my teeth.favorite features:overall look and performance of the vehicle.	1
	navigation system is excellent.	1
	car is beautiful, and has people following me around to see what it is.	1
	dealership service dept.	1
	courteous and tries hard to please.	1
	parts almost always in stock or readily available.	1
	gas mileage is excellent.suggested improvements:please, hyundai, help me find a way to improve the ride on this car.	1
	on good roads, it is sweet, but on nasty louisiana back-roads, it is killing me.	1
	i just bought it.i saw the commercial for the genesis, had to check it out.	1
	the car looks good, inside and out.	1
	both the driver and passenger have power seats.	1
	plenty of pick up, 290 horse.	1
	when the windows rolled up nothing but quiet.favorite features:the stereo system, out of sight.	1
	plenty of acceleration.suggested improvements:the seats are very hard.	1
	i went to an upholsterer.	1
	added foam to the drivers seat.	1
	the passenger seat is the same way.	1
	the car came with tinted windows, at night hard to see cars from behind, the windows are very dark.	1
	when going over bumps feels like your in a truck, very hard.	1
	pros and cons.unless you own a tire shop, don't buy.	1
	although maintained properly, the rear (drive) tires were junk in 15,000 miles!	1
	don't buy the optional gps/camera system---pitiful!	1
	rides like a tank!favorite features:draws many compliments.	1
	roomy trunk, many luxury features for much less money.	1
	great bumper to bumper warranty.suggested improvements:replace gps/backup screen or don't offer!	1
	soften ride !	1
	improve tire life.	1
	e class mb has nothing on this car!the factory dunlop sport 5000 tires were a disaster--noisy, rough riding.	1
	they might be fine if your planning on doing some late night 'drifting'in your local walmart parking lot!	1
	i doubt that most purchased this car with that in mind!	1
	most of my driving is long distance touring and those tires were not compatible with that driving style--replaced with kumho ecsta lx platinum 'sneaks'--what a difference--very quiet--very smooth--great wet road traction and all but eliminated that choppy ride except on real bumpy back roads.	1
	not quite the ride of the e class mb (realistically the benchmark of 'smooth') i dumped but real close on the open road--definitely not worth the price difference!favorite features:fit, finish, interior and exterior design, comfort, ride(after ditching those dunlops), performance, mpg(consistently over 30 mph on highway trips on regular fuel).	1
	only one problem in 30,000 miles--throttle position sensor replaced.suggested improvements:suspension 'tweak' to eliminate the chop on rough road surfaces and a better pairing with tires would make this car exceptional rather than excellent!	1
	this might be the best car i have ever owned!	1
	!	1
	great car even with problems.i bought mine used w/ 18,000 miles on it.	1
	it's the 3.8 w/ all options and now has 25,000 miles on it.	1
	it has been flawless with one exception - an electrical problem that effected the stereo.	1
	after replacing all components (some twice), hyundai had over $18,000 in parts at retail price back into it.	1
	i was also without it for at least a month.	1
	also, i hadn't had the car for a week when the a stone hit the condenser and i was hit with a $530 bill to fix it.	1
	overall, i haven't been pleased with they responses from hyundai, but the dealership tried hard to make my happy.	1
	all of that aside, i still love the car.favorite features:i love the way the car looks (both inside and out), drives, comfort of seats and the quality of materials used.	1
	i get lots of looks with people trying to figure out what it is.	1
	i was looking at the e class, but am glad i made the decision i to try the genesis.	1
	w/ everything now working, i love itsuggested improvements:while i enjoy the stereo, it's not nearly as good as others i've owned.	1
	the price to fix items is absurd and the inability to get parts is crazy - sometimes up to a month for a part.	1
	they need to be more honest w/ the warranty.	1
	it's only 3 years 36k on electronics.	1
	terrible car / forgettable experience.after almost decades of owning premium / luxury cars, i made the regrettable decision to buy a hyundai.	1
	all my friends and family were skeptical.	1
	i have spent the past several months working with dealers and hma consumer affairs to address the problems.	1
	every time they tell me they do not see the problems.	1
	is anyone else having these problems?	1
	the whole experience has been extremely disappointing.	1
	1. rattling / grinding sound when driving at lower gears 2. jerky transmission shifts 3. squeaking / cranking sound from the rear seat when driving 4. loud rumbling noise when starting the car 5. vibrations while driving 6. tires worn out at 25k miles 7. cruise control does not workfavorite features:interior spacesuggested improvements:hyundai should properly test their car before putting it on the market.	1
	hyundai consumer affairs and dealer service departments need to be better trained and show empathy to customers and stop making excuses!	1
	wouldn't buy another one.this car is not an entrance to the luxury class by a long shot.	1
	the transmission in my car is an abomination to the name of luxury car.	1
	it shifts with jerky motions, can't find the gear it needs to run in and has to catch up to the engine after braking.	1
	two trips to the dealership and i have been assured that this transmission is within hyundai specs.	1
	the cruise control loses 3mph up any grade hill and gains up to 3mph down the hill.	1
	i have a 2002 i-35 that keeps set speed dead-on.	1
	i think hyundai needs to reverse engineer an infiniti transmission and cruise control.	1
	the ride is rough and the engine is noisy.	1
	other than that the car is ok.favorite features:outside and inside styling, among the best on the roadsuggested improvements:none because i won't be concerned with the next one.	1
	honestly.. very disappointed!	1
	!sadly bought my 4.6 loaded brand new after reading about all the great reviews.	1
	its now been 2 years since my regretable purchase.	1
	please let me reassure you i am a real person and not a rep from some other ripoff car company like bmw!	1
	tires very cheap replaced at 12,000 miles!	1
	key needs to be within 1 foot or placed in slot to operate the pushbutton start!.	1
	terrible in the snow and wet roads with the rear drive!	1
	backup camera works 50% of time!	1
	you need a hyundai brand i-pod cable to work you i-pod connection (extra 75.00) hmm never mentioned!	1
	the transmnission shifting is a nightmare and very embarrasing!	1
	frequent updates for stereo _ etc.	1
	im outta words with alottt more to say!favorite features:i have more to add from above.	1
	there really is no favorite feature to this car.	1
	only that you dont see alot of them around.. gee, now i know why!	1
	you have to have a college degree to operate the gps system which is 20 some pages to read and does not make sense.. i went on you tube and watched the operating techniques.	1
	again what a major ripoff with the cheapppp tires they slap on the car.. many cut corners.	1
	they promised me a genesis if and when my car went down for service.. wow how nice..but another lie.. they tried to push a cheap sonota on me which i had to deny and battle for the genesis.. again, which they promised!suggested improvements:fix all the many problems.. its just not me, i've read the other reviews and the people who have not complained yet.. well, just wait and give them ample time!	1
	there is truly a reason you do not see these cars on the road!	1
	i hope my review wasn't too much of a tyrade.. but i truly am speaking the truth and trading this thing in on a 2011 kia optima.	1
	bad tires o genesis.after only 7500 miles my two rear tires were completely bald.	1
	the dealer replaced them commenting they had never seen anything like that before.	1
	after the next 8000 miles the remaing two tires were also bald, but the dealer and hyundai refused to replace.	1
	do not buy a hyundai with dunlop sp sport 5000 m tires.	1
	insist the dealer change them or don't buy the car.	1
	these are junk tires and should never be put on a car, as they are unsafe.favorite features:the genesis is a great car, but they have cheapened it with the dunlop sp sport 5000m tires.suggested improvements:get rid of the dunlop sp sport 5000m tires.	1
	i must have the only lemon they made or do i ?the 2009 genesis/4dr sdn 4.6l v8 i have leased since 07/09 from sheehy nissan hyundai is a true lemon!	1
	even after submitting a lemon law complaint to to dealership and hyundai motor america for numerous electrical issues, replacement of the transmission, catalytic converter burn out, interior frnt.	1
	windshield condensation build up during the cold months, gear shift sticking on more one occasion, starter switch being replaced, steering column control switch failure, the rubber seal in the sun roof coming out, brake light failure, they still refuse to take this piece of junk back!	1
	i believe it's a faulty parts problem as some of their car have had the same issues.	1
	hyundai assurance (not)!!	1
	!favorite features:the hands free features are good, as i feel they should be available in all vehicles now days for safety reasons.	1
	used to be able to hit 120 with out a problem prior to the vehicle having so many electrical problems.	1
	once they started the vehicle was being serviced every three months after the first year.	1
	i say hyundai owners/leases taking a stand and do a class action law suit for faulty parts instead of a car problem.	1
	electrical and transmission issues are major in this genesis sdn 4.6l v8.	1
	searched for sheehy nissan hyundai of waldorf md to write a review and can't seem to locate a web site for them, so this helps me express my frustration in having 7 invoices for major repairs.suggested improvements:stop using faulty parts in your vehicles.	1
	after several major issues not even two years of leasing is pretty overwhelming for any one to contend with!	1
	genesis or not the one i am driving with a lot of hesitation shouldn't even be on the road.	1
	who knows what will shut down on me next.	1
	it's pretty bad when the service manager tell you he's replaced a lot of techs.	1
	because they were failing to make repairs when in fact they were not!	1
	my first complaint was after my 15,000 service check.	1
	no problems going in but after i left everything started falling apart and hasn't stopped yet.	1
	shame the consumer has to deal with such poor service from a dealership and hyundai motor america.	1
	emotional!	1
