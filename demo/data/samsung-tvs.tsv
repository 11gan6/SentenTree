	awesome tv!!!!!!!.	1
	i've had this tv for over 2 years and it's still amazing!!!	1
	value, value, value.	1
	"i'd buy it again in a heartbeat when i need a new tv for game room, keeping room, etc.           		"	1
	exceeded our expectations.	1
	a great tv for a really reasonable price.	1
	we couldn't be happier with the picture quality, ease of use, and simple set-up.	1
	this is a bedroom tv that sits perpendicular to a large, 3-paned glass slide and opposite two very large windows and yet the picture has no glare in full florida sun.	1
	our only complaint is that the tv's speakers produce very poor sound quality.	1
	we remedied that problem by hooking the tv to a small onkyo receiver with bose speakers and the sound is now terrific.	1
	we waited 7 months to write a review to see what problems might develop and there have been absolutely none.	1
	"a great set for the money with an outstanding picture.           		"	1
	samsung is the best!.	1
	i bought this to put in our bedroom and we find our self's watching tv more in there than the living room!	1
	i've always had sony's, but now i'm definitely going for samsung.	1
	great lcd television all around!	1
	"!           		"	1
	samsung and amazon two great companys.	1
	"before purchasing my product i had not dealt with either company before.i was slightly appresensive about dealing with companies i was not familiar with.however after deciding                      to make my purchase i decided to give them a try.i have no regrets about making that decision.amazon aided my decision by provideing me with extensive information about my product.the price they offered was perfect for me because i am on a fixed income.i heard of samsung but had never owned one of their products.the first samsung we purchased was for our living room a 52inch flat screen lcd hd tv.i was very pleased with the quality of every acpect with the exception of the sound.we added extra speakers and the sound is surperb.the features of the tv work perfect for us.i was so pleased we purchased a second sumsung 40inch lcd hd tv for the bed room with the same features as the first one.i would highly recommend both companies to anyone who is interested  inculding my family and friends.           		"	1
	nice tv for the price.	1
	we got this tv for 6+ months and everything is good and meets our expectation.	1
	"relatively speaking tv speakers might be the weakest link, but we hook it up with external speakers so that's not a problem for us.           		"	1
	best 60hz 1080p hdtv under $1000!.	1
	i did a lot of research looking for our perfect high definition television for about a year before finally making our purchase.	1
	because we have only one television in our house we wanted to be certain of our choice.	1
	sure, you can spend more money for the same size television with similar specs, but why would you?	1
	the samsung ln40a550 has a stellar full hi-def 1080p picture for a 40' hdtv running at only 60hz.	1
	after seeking out an hdtv for many moons that would satisfy our viewing needs we had basically settled on one of three options: a sony bravia, a sharp aquos or the samsung television which we now own and couldn't be happier with.	1
	the resolution is superb, the colors are rich and performance is rock solid.	1
	from the opening chime you'll be delighted until you turn it off and the set chimes a second time (there is the option to turn this off if it annoys you).	1
	there are three hdmi inputs and a pc input (handily located on the side for quick laptop connectivity); we currently only utilize two hdmi ports, one for an xbox 360 which doubles as our upconverting dvd player and one for our hd dvr/receiver.	1
	the set up is a snap, and if you're familiar with menu schemes, you'll quickly find yourself navigating with ease.	1
	we picked this set up on sale for under $800 after waiting a long time for prices to come down and i see no viable competition for it in the $1100 and under range.	1
	if you require more hdmi inputs or demand a 120 hz picture, then i can't quite recommend this for you, but if you have typical family needs and want a rock-solid beautiful television for under $1000 you can do no better.	1
	buy it.	1
	"you'll be glad you did.           		"	1
	buy something else.	1
	please consider another brand of lcd.	1
	the sound on this set is inferior to almost all other sets on the market.	1
	the set stopped working completely one and a half months after the 1 year warrenty.	1
	i made a mistake and wish you do not.	1
	"sincerely.....dennis           		"	1
	excellent tv..very sharp..many hookups!!.	1
	this tv is amazing!!!	1
	i bought this at bestbuy in fall '08 for the black friday thanksgiving thingy for only $605!!!!	1
	best 600 i ever spent...i am currently using this as my pc screeen & theatre tv in my living room!!!	1
	got the hd tv from the local cable tv provider and everything looks beautiful....for the class it's in i think it is probably the best looking quality!!!	1
	easy onscreen software to use!!!	1
	only downfalls i have with this is - hookups could use 1 more hdmi and/or dvi!!	1
	!only the rf cable input can be used for pip function!!!!	1
	i own a samsung bdp-1500 bluray player so the anynet+ feature is sweet...put in a disk and it turns on the tv and the theatre system all in one (everything must be samsung product & compatible with anynet feature)                      owned many samsung products....this one the best!!	1
	can't wait for the samsung 120hz or 240hz to be in my living room next!!!	1
	"!           		"	1
	best bang for the buck.	1
	have had it for 6 months, everything is perfect.	1
	easily the best $[...] i've ever spent.	1
	believed it to be the best value in an hdtv back when i was doing my research before i bought it, now i'm sure of it.	1
	"get off the fence if you're on it and buy this one!           		"	1
	very nice tv.	1
	we got this tv about 6 months ago and have been enjoying it ever since then.	1
	it's a wonderful product and my wife and i both like it very much.	1
	now we are considering getting an even bigger one in the coming holiday season.	1
	"five stars in my eyes, no doubt.           		"	1
	do not buy this tv!!.	1
	after having the television for 6 months, it has died on me!	1
	it started with a funky hot pink and green 'static' along with a loud noise that can only be described as speaker feedback and it has now died.	1
	i cannot even get it to turn on when i press the power button, but if i leave it plugged in it just turns on randomly, sometimes with a picture, sometimes not, but it always ends up going to a weird color and making that noise.	1
	luckily, i am still covered by the manufacturer warranty and have a technician coming out tomorrow to fix it, but what happens if it dies again and i'm not covered?	1
	how can i trust that it won't happen again?	1
	when you buy an expensive television such as this, you want to at least be able to trust it will be working for at least 3-5 years!	1
	i don't think that's too much to ask!	1
	so please, save yourself some misery and go another route.	1
	"this is not the tv for you!           		"	1
	samsung 40in 1080p lcd.	1
	the seller shipped this item quickly.	1
	when i set it up in my bedroom i was amazed by the picture.	1
	the  p-i-p worked, wished there was a way to get sound or switch between main image and p-i-p.  i'd suggested setting up with external speakers if in a living room.	1
	"over all i'm very happy with this purchase.           		"	1
	best $800 flat panel lcd i could find.	1
	my goal when my old faithful tv finally gave up the ghost was to buy the best $800 tv i could find.	1
	i purchased this samsung on april 7, 2009 for $849 and i am happy to say i think i succeeded.	1
	i was lucky that cr magazine just featured flat panel tvs in the march issue and this set ranked third in its class (first was the 42 inch version of the same tv).	1
	it's sleek and beautiful.	1
	for me, the picture is great.	1
	i don't have any hd, but this set's standard definition picture quality makes me believe that hd would be awesome.	1
	audiophiles may not like the sound quality of the speakers, but most of them will channel their sets through surround sound systems anyway.	1
	"i think this tv is an excellent value and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.           		"	1
	dissatified with shipping rules for electronics.	1
	about a month ago i order a dvd player form this company .	1
	it was delivered to my home address since they can not deliver to p.o.	1
	box's .	1
	when the dvd player arrived i was not at home the ups people left me a note to pick it up within 5 days or return back to sender.	1
	i called ups(united postal service) the same day i received the notice and they said that my dvd player was still  on the truck coming back that same day.	1
	i said ,fine will be in to pick up the very next day.	1
	i went in the very next day the ups people advised me that this company does not have a will call policy meaning do not hold any items return to sender.	1
	i immediately called the electronics company, i was advised by their customer service dept.	1
	that they have this policy for security reason due to electronics being shipped out.	1
	to make a long story short it took me three weeks and the help of amazon gurantee return policy(they intervined and contacted the company after i did) to get the refund with the shipping charged included.	1
	"i will continue to use amazon they are so professional and courteous but this compay is for the birds and i would never use them again and they need to be red flagged.           		"	1
	excellent!!!.	1
	i am very glad i purchased this tv.	1
	it been over 6 months and no problems so far.	1
	picture is great.	1
	"i love it!           		"	1
	nice tv but crappy internalspeakers.	1
	i only gave this a 4 star because of the internal speakers.	1
	the are not crisp and deep sounding.	1
	they sound kind of dull during sound effects on movies and video games.	1
	"i use my home theater system more than i thought.           		"	1
	review from college student just starting work.	1
	i am a recent college graduate starting work this fall.	1
	i wanted a good quality lcd tv that would last me for the next decade or so, without breaking my little piggy bank.	1
	price paid: $820 + tax from amazon                      duration i've had tv: 2 months                      pros:                      *swivel on tv has a very generous range, which is great for me since i have it in my bedroom and can watch tv from my bed, desk chair, or futon by simply rotating the tv.	1
	*picture quality: i cannot ask for more from the picture quality.	1
	in particular, the color and contrast are amazing and stunning.	1
	*tweaking ability: for those of you who really want to have the most accurate picture quality, this samsung model lets you tweak everything you need to professional calibrate it.	1
	you can google for calibration settings for this model from professionals and then set your tv to these settings and know you have a calibrated tv.	1
	you can also use any thx dvd movie you have and goto extra features for the thx calibration on video and sound (e.g.	1
	monsters inc dvd, cars dvd, pirate of carribean dvd).	1
	*channel surfing speed: some lcd tvs take forever to change the channel, not with this model.	1
	it is swift.	1
	not as fast on my sony lcd, but fast enough such that you can switch channels without being frustrated at all.	1
	*remote: samsung has the best remote i have ever seen on a tv.	1
	the keys are large and spaced out and intuitive.	1
	also, there is a button on the top that you can press that turns on the light for the keys, which is great!	1
	backlit keys for night time movie watching is amazing!	1
	*wiselink: you can plug into its usb port a camera/jump drive, etc.	1
	and it will play a slide show of your pictures and music.	1
	pictures look stunning!	1
	a little slow sometimes to read large picture files off plugged in camera, but def bearable.	1
	cons:                      *standard definition channels look like crap on this tv.	1
	i have a 6 year old sony rear projection tv downstairs that processed standard def so much better than this tv.	1
	this tv makes standard def.	1
	shows look like cell phone clips (quality wise).	1
	this would be my biggest gripe on this tv: standard def.	1
	sucks so badly.	1
	* pip does not support 2 tv channels (i dont know anybody who would use pip the way it's setup on this tv; you can only do pip with another source like pc input with tv.	1
	awkward).	1
	* speakers are decent but don't get nearly loud enough for parties or anything beyond personal movie watching.	1
	def.	1
	invest in a soundbar or some simple home theater system if you take sound seriously.	1
	* turning the tv on is a little slower than i would like.	1
	it needs about 3-5 seconds to fully turn on, and sometimes i'm not sure if i've activated it or not.	1
	* remote must be pointed pretty darn straight at the ir port in order for it to process the signal.	1
	not too annoying but wish they had a more liberal ir range.	1
	* usb wiselink works great for pictures but this model does not support movies thru its usb port!	1
	need to buy their step-up model to get the movie support on wiselink.	1
	i tried to do a firmware update, but there isn't a hack for updating the wiselink to the movie version.	1
	"may need to buy a wd tv or something to get that movie experience.           		"	1
	samsung ln40a550.	1
	overall, i am happy with the product.	1
	i don't use this as my main tv so i don't have hd programming on it.	1
	still, the picture is quite good.	1
	the exterior of the set is well designed.	1
	my only complaint is a thin white light below the screen that goes on when the set is turned on (it makes an annoying chime too).	1
	there is not need for the light or the chime so i don't understand why the manufacture decided to add it.	1
	however, this is very minor and should not deter anyone from buying the set.	1
	"in sum, i find the tv to be an excellent one for the price.           		"	1
	better hope it works!.	1
	i had this tv for less than 6 months when it died.	1
	the problems seemed to start when i got verizon fios and the techs connected the fios set-top box to the samsung with an hdmi cable.	1
	turns out that samsung has moved ahead with the their hdmi input standard, while motorola (who makes most set-top boxes) has not.	1
	both samsung and verizon recommend only using component cables to connect such boxes (which is a whole other problem).	1
	anyway, the set stopped functioning and the repair techs said they need to replace the microprocessors.	1
	they tell me that samsung is notorious for poor warranty support and resist placing broken sets.	1
	parts can take weeks to months to receive.	1
	the repair folks do government contracts in this area and told me that even the pentagon waits months for their samsung repairs.	1
	they advised buying sharp the next time.	1
	samsung 'field reps' called to troubleshoot, but when i called the company to talk to them (1-800-samsung) no one there knew anything about 'field reps.'  try it yourself.	1
	"you'll be amazed.           		"	1
	good for us.	1
	not a great review but for somebody who can't understand all the terms of latest tv technology but just have to upgrade to a flat screen.checked out a similar configuration tv from sony but it was way too expensive.i am reviewing this after 6 months of purchase.i have been busy admiring the flat screen.	1
	coming to tv, it is excellent for us.it has 3 hdmi outputs and oh yes, you can connect your 1st gen xbox to this.no extra cables needed.just connect the xbox and tv with existing cables.but for connecting anything else, you need to order hdmi cables.order them from amazon as they are very expensive in the stores.	1
	no problems reported so far.	1
	sound can be a bit better.	1
	the remote is bit big for my hands but i guess i can live with it.the picture quality is good.it doesn't have the 120hz feature but unless you watch sports everyday hour of the day, i don't think that matters.even with ports, there is a sports mode which can used but in normal mode, you can notice the pixels since it lacks the 120 hz feature.the menu can be a bit tiresome.i can't remember which function is in which part of the menu.i have to keep checking each and every option till i find the required setting.	1
	on the whole, its good tv for the price for anyone who doesn't spend a lot of time infront of it.	1
	"the shipping from ceva was good.white glove service.           		"	1
	great tv, but it makes noise..           we've had the tv for several months now and it is wonderful.	1
	very clear pictures, especially in hd.	1
	the only minor complaint is that there is a relatively long delay between pushing the power 'on' button and the tv actually turning on (1-2 seconds), and when it does, it has a loud chime.	1
	this wouldn't be annoying except that we have an infant in the house who is often sleeping in the same room as the tv, and the chime is loud enough to disturb her from sleep.	1
	it also chimes when you turn it off, though if you mute the tv, the chime is muted as well.	1
	wish that was an option when you turned it on.	1
	"otherwise, fantastic tv, great price, clear picture.           		"	1
	wow!.	1
	i would recommend this to anyone.	1
	it has a great quality picture.	1
	"well worth the money spent.           		"	1
	6ave may ship you the 'b' model..           i ordered the ln40a550 from this page, and i actually received the ln40b550 from 6ave.	1
	this is indeed a 'newer model', but the b-type does not have picture-in-picture, and it has the subtle red 'touch of color' while the a-type does not.	1
	i can't believe they did this!	1
	here's their response:                      'thanks for your e-mail.	1
	we sincerely apologize but we sent you the upgraded model for the one you ordered.	1
	if you do not want the new model, please call us at 877-... for the ra number and the instructions for the return.	1
	thanks.'	1
	it's not enough of a bother for me to return the thing, but still: caveat emptor!	1
	"anyway, the tv is great, although it's not what i ordered!           		"	1
	great tv... but do not order from ''electronics expo' from nj.	1
	excellent tv.	1
	but watch who you are ordering from.	1
	i have a problem with the tv that came damage during shipment.	1
	i have called several time to resolve the issue with exchanging it.	1
	they told me to contact the 'manufacturer' to fix the problem.	1
	so, i called samsung and they had a tech to see the problem.	1
	when the tech saw the tv, he told me that samsung with not replace the lcd screen.	1
	he told me, it would 'cost' me $900 to replace it.	1
	i call the electronics expo again, and now they tell me that they have to contact the shipper.	1
	i waited and waited with no responds.	1
	i was so angry, i disputed with my credit card and gave them a bad feedback.	1
	i also had a similar problem with vann's but there are great.	1
	i love them.	1
	"watch out for 'electronics expo'.           		"	1
	very satisfied.	1
	i walked out of best buy with the ln40a550 for $720 brand new so that go me started on the right foot!	1
	i have had this tv for a week and absolutely love it.	1
	i have my macbook pro hooked up via dvi > hdmi and it looks stunning.	1
	i also purchased a sony dvd player (dvp-ns710h/b) and so far it has done a great job of upscaling dvds to the 1080p resolution over hdmi.	1
	also, regular cable tv doesn't look as bad as i thought it would after reading some of the reviews.	1
	while the native sound is unimpressive, i have a surround sound system hooked up to it.	1
	"overall, i am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely consider buying samsung again.           		"	1
	pip feature.	1
	i ordered the product hoping the pip feature would be the same as what i'm used to but it is not.	1
	it's useless for the application i'd hoped for.	1
	"i'm still trying to figure out if i can use it at all.           		"	1
	unbeivable picture quality for the price.	1
	this is the most beautiful picture quality i have ever seen.	1
	i knew samsung was the best, but the price was so worth it.	1
	"i would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a fabulous hd tv at a great price.           		"	1
	broken tv took 3 weeks to fix.	1
	samsung sent me a tv that worked for the first 3 days and then broke all on its own.	1
	when i asked for the repair, it took 3 weeks before they could repair it because they have to try different parts and then order the next part and reschedule after each time they try.	1
	all in all it's fixed now, but when i called customer service to let them know how ridiculous it was the lady was rude and trying to brush me off.	1
	"i most likely will not be purchasing a samsung tv next time.           		"	1
	samsung ln40a550.	1
	a couple of nonclaimers i want to put out there.	1
	i have yet to calibrate the tv and comcast compression sucks.	1
	hd 1080p so far on cable is pretty non-existent so for a full appreciation of the product you will have to connect a console or a pc...i'm not sure if 1080p is supported via dishnetwork or dishtv.	1
	the tv itself looks great, blacks are black and colors are vibrant.	1
	i would make the purchase again.	1
	this isn't 120hz just to put it out there for you folks not in the know and as much as it may seem that is thing to get, i'm pretty comfortable with my purchase.	1
	"plus its cheaper....           		"	1
	good tv for the money.	1
	bought this with samsung bluray player.	1
	great deal from amazon with free shipping.	1
	picture quality is very good,i'm not even sure i miss the 120 mhz refresh.	1
	this is my first lcd tv.	1
	"i agree with others that the remote can be finicky and it is a dust magnet.           		"	1
	great tv.	1
	very pleased - my husband loves the big screen and beautiful picture for all sports!	1
	"1080p definitely worth it.           		"	1
	incredible color ... superior price ... perfect!.	1
	i purchased a samsung lcd hdtv on the recommendation of several prople in the television business.	1
	i was not disappointed.	1
	what amazing color!	1
	i was, however, concerned about buying from amazon, thinking that i could get any necessary service and, if necessary, set-up from a local vendor.	1
	amazon, however, offered the best price (by a mile!)	1
	and delivered and set-up the set for me without any extra charge!	1
	the set-up, by the way, was easy .... simply involving positioning the set, attaching the cable, putting the provided batteries in the remote and power up!	1
	the picture is fantastic ... the black is crystal black ... the colors astounding.	1
	if i have any reservation, it is the sound.	1
	not particularly good ... probably needs an ancillary set of speakers.	1
	"but for the price it is extraordinary.           		"	1
	simply amazing.	1
	went from a 19in tv to a 40in samsung and very satisfied.	1
	i had checked different tvs for quality, view-ability, price, reputation, etc, for 3 months and finally decided on this set for $799, the best price in april 2009.  even the tuner card [i use a roof antenna] was more powerful than the converter box i bought with the gov't coupon.	1
	very happy all around.	1
	"plus, when i registered at the samsung website, i was given a 3 month extension on the warranty for free.           		"	1
	middle of the road review.	1
	let me start this review by saying that with present technology the world is far from being prepared to administer high definition tv.	1
	with this in mind it makes it very difficult to give an accurate review of this samsung hd lcd tv.	1
	i have cable service with the digital option that provides the hd channels.	1
	i also have a dvd player that is an older model and does not support the progressive scan technology.	1
	when viewing a hd program that is broadcast in 1080p the picture is acceptable and superior to my old analog sony tv.	1
	i say that with some reservations because the sony was a really exceptional tv that provided 16 years of service.	1
	hopefully this new set will last as long.	1
	one of the things that i like about the flat screen tv is the weight.	1
	a 40 inch lcd is around 50 lbs.	1
	this opens up many options for placement of the tv almost anywhere in a room.	1
	hang it on a wall or set it on a table or cabinet.	1
	the picture quality when viewing an hd program is very good, but that is one of the problems.	1
	not all broadcasts on the hd channels are high def and the ones that are...well they come in many different formats.	1
	some are 16x9, some are 720p,  some are 1080p and the rest are some form of 4x3.	1
	i bought a 40 in tv to watch 40 inches of tv.	1
	this is not always the case.	1
	although this is not the fault of samsung it is frustrating.	1
	to compound this frustration samsung has included picture size options to compensate for the different formats.	1
	this is fine if you don't mind things being out of proportion.	1
	one note about the options for these new flat screen tv's.	1
	they do provide a lot of options and one can adjust his set to his or her own specifications.	1
	i have been an electronics technician for over 40 years and have been involved with maintaining cctv systems for the most of those 40 years.	1
	the point i'm trying to make is that most of this technology is not new to me, but i still have trouble setting up this new tv with all the options available.	1
	i wonder how many individuals actually have their tv setup properly or even know the difference whether or not it is set up right.	1
	to make my point my wife just asked me how to adjust the picture so you can see the writing on the bottom of the screen.	1
	this isn't the first time i've showed her how to make this adjustment.	1
	audio.	1
	well i'm not particularly impressed with the sound.	1
	if you go to some of the major retailers you will notice that they have all the volumes turned down and usually have an expensive sound system playing.	1
	if you think about it, the flat screen tv's are only a few inches in depth with a small space at the bottom or on the sides.	1
	this doesn't leave much room for quality speakers.	1
	so think about investing in a quality av sound system, 5.1 or better.	1
	sports and fast action is another area where lcd tv lacking.	1
	they don't respond fast enough to give a picture that isn't pixilated or blurred.	1
	even with a 5ms refresh rate the performance is poor at best when viewing fast action.	1
	i knew about this problem before my purchase but i thought that with 5ms refresh rate it would be minimal i was wrong.	1
	so where does this leave me in reviewing this samsung tv.	1
	i'm going to give it 3 stars.	1
	i'm basing this on poor sound quality,  difficulty in setting up the options on the tv and the poor fast action response.	1
	all flat screen tv's have these same inequities.	1
	"samsung is still the best as compared to the others.           		"	1
	awesome!.	1
	we love it!	1
	it is an instant setup with intuitive menu.	1
	the picture is extreamly crisp on digital stations but unbelievable on high definition.	1
	we receive signals from our rooftop antenna which does not yet have a rotor so only stations broadcasting digital from one direction about 40 miles away come in well.	1
	digital stations are all or nothing but the signal strength can be displayed.	1
	we expect that with a rotor to turn the antenna other stations will be just as good.	1
	before purchase, we did our homework and found this samsung t.v.	1
	was highly rated and we find that rating well deserved.	1
	"amazon's bottom line price was the best we could find.           		"	1
	samsung lcd is great!.	1
	we had researched lcd's for almost a year and went to some of the box stores to actually view the models we thought we might be interested in.	1
	the samsung ln40a550 ended up at the top of our list.	1
	we were able to get the best price through amazon (the prices do fluctuate, so it's worth the effort to be patient and check on the price over a period of time) amazon's delivery service is great!	1
	we received our tv within a few days.	1
	the delivery service calls to arrange a convienent time to deliver and set up your tv.	1
	it is unpackaged, inspected and plugged in to check the blue screen.	1
	we have been completely satisfied with the sound, color and quality of the set.	1
	there is a multitude of adjustments you can make to get exactly the picture and sound you want.	1
	we were especially impressed by the sound quality of the set.	1
	while we may add a surround sound system in the future, it really isn't necessary with the 550.  one note...we did not have hd when we purchased the set.	1
	we added the feature to our cable a few weeks later and i have to say the picture quality is better on the hd channels...no noticable pixeling, even at close range.	1
	"i would say our overall experience has been a very good one with both amazon and this tv!           		"	1
	great tv for your buck.	1
	tv looks awesome, i bought this to use w/ my xbox & what a difference it made.	1
	the sound is not the best ever but if you have a surround system, it won't matter.	1
	picture looks clean & you can even fine tune to your liking through the menu options.	1
	"very happy with it.           		"	1
	outstanding tv.	1
	this is an amazing tv.	1
	i have had it for about 9 months now and i have been loving every minute of it.	1
	i have all my video sources hooked to my onkyo tx-606 and then hooked to the tv via hdmi.	1
	blurays and ps3 graphics shine on this tv.	1
	this tv truly shows what hd is suppose to look like.	1
	the price is still the same as what i paid nearly 9 months ago.	1
	that makes me very happy with my purchase.	1
	":)           		"	1
	fast delivery.	1
	tv arrived in 3 days.	1
	easy to hook up to sattelite; great picture, looks good in tv cabinet.	1
	"no complaints.           		"	1
	great buy.	1
	"dollar for dollar this was more than i expected and would recommend to everyone looking for lcd tv.           		"	1
	great purchase.	1
	"very happy with the tv as well as the quick shipping.i would purchase this product again.           		"	1
	disappointed.	1
	went specifically for a samsung.	1
	i loved my 720p, so as far as i was concerned, nothing could compare.	1
	the 720p pic was awesome!	1
	that model was discontinued.	1
	this pic can't compare to the 720p.	1
	even w/ hd channels on cable, and digital cable box,and hdmi cables,the pic looks grainy, especially in dark scenes.	1
	on non hd channels, it's like watching an old 'tube' tv.	1
	on my 720p, the pic's were always sharp and crisp, and i didn't need to watch a hd station.	1
	to be blunt, the sound sucks.	1
	i have it on a stand and not wall mounted, so that may have something to do w/ the way the sound bounces off of something.	1
	i just want to watch tv, so i'm not interested in setting up surround sound, or extra speakers to correct it.	1
	i researched several samsung's for a couple of monthes, and after all the rave reviews just waited for the right price on this specific model.	1
	boy am i disappointed.	1
	i'd say you can't get a worse picture for an hdtv if you went for a cheaper, bargain brand.	1
	in this case, i didn't get what i paid for.	1
	i've been researching and watching prices for a 50' plasma and it was down to samsung and panasonic.	1
	"as far as i'm concerned, samsung is out of the running for my next tv purchase.           		"	1
	great tv.	1
	my other tv an akai=a bad tv, the samsung is great easy to set up the base is already attached.	1
	i do recommend using a sony dvd player i use the rdr-gx300 model, owned it for almost 3 years now and it works great with the samsung lcd tv as well.	1
	on the technical side if u use a cable or satelite box check with the respective company for the hd box and deffinately get and hd box that is hdmi capable.	1
	from the box to the tv it's the best.	1
	on the dvd player whatever make or model u have use an s_video cable to connect to the tv.	1
	"other than that enjoy your viewing...the picture is great good sound off the set too.           		"	1
	excellent product.	1
	unit was delivered on-time; setup by delivery company.	1
	ready to use out of the box with very little tweaking.	1
	extremely happy with the purchase.	1
	took about a week to adjust from a 27' to a 40' but now that we have, can't imagine watching anything else!	1
	"!           		"	1
	just what the doctor ordered.	1
	i checked out the samsung ln40a550 at both best buy and circuit city and really liked the picture it was delivering.	1
	i have a 50' samsung dlp and really love it.	1
	so going after another samsung was a no brainer.	1
	one just has to be patient (about 4 months)and keep checking the sites looking for that right price and amazon came through for me.	1
	it was delivered on time, the delivery personnel removed it from the box and set it up for us in our bedroom.	1
	the picture was great with regular cable hook up and if you go through the channel set up it via cable it will pick up hd programing for a lot of channels.	1
	gives it a weird channel number i.e.	1
	5-1 and that picture was great at 720p.	1
	once i installed the hd box awesome.	1
	for the geeks out there the set has plenty of options to improve the picture, sound etc.	1
	"highly recommend this set and my dealings with amazon have all been positive.           		"	1
	wow!!!.	1
	i've owned this set for a little over a month, i'm almost afraid to write the review because i haven't had the best luck with electronics and i don't want to jinx it, but it's honestly been one of the best purchases i've made.	1
	prior to purchasing, i did some research on the net, and samsung consistantly came up as one the best hdtv manufacturers and this model particularly ranked high.	1
	originally, i was looking at the 32' hdtv but the 40' went on sale a couple days later, it had all the right bells & whistles, and for the money i couldn't ask for better.	1
	the shipping was free and superfast (within days), the delivery men brought it up to the second floor, took it out of the box and set it down on the stand.	1
	the set up was quick and easy.	1
	the picture is just amazingly beautiful.	1
	after reading other reviews, the sound quality was of some concern but it sounds as good if not better than other tvs i had checked out.	1
	believe me i'm in no hurry to set up the surround sound system.	1
	i've gone to a few friend's homes and overall their higher end sets just don't compare.	1
	"you won't be disappointed.           		"	1
	beautiful tv until it stopped working.	1
	this is a beautiful and sleek tv with a great picture and lots of nice adjustment features.	1
	only problem was that it stopped turning on less than one month after i bought it.	1
	not what you would expect from a $1000 tv.	1
	"waiting for a replacement from amazon right now--i will give samsung one more try.           		"	1
	love it!.	1
	i bought this for my parents after their 12 year old 32' tv went out and they had to use a little 19' for a while.	1
	we were going to get another 32' but talking to my siblings and researching online and at stores we decided on a 40' so i started to look for the best price and i found at it here at amazon as usual.	1
	we were not looking at samsung's because they were on average $[...], but then i found this one for $[...] less and i am so happy with it.	1
	the sound and picture is great, the glare is minimal.	1
	the viewing angles are really great.	1
	i can't think of any negatives on this tv it is great quality for a great price i highly recommend it if you are not looking for the most updated technology.	1
	update                      i have had the tv awhile now and the only complaint is that unless you have surround sound on movies you have to crank the volume way up to like 40 other then that is is still great.	1
	"update                      if you turn the surround sound on the sound is much better on movies and tv shows in general, also if you change the color mode to normal and the mode of the tv to standard it is a much better picture and saves energy, it will automatically go from darker to brighter depending on the brightness of the room.           		"	1
	keeffy.	1
	great item!	1
	could have done with a hdmi cable inclusive in the package.	1
	"easy to install and very good clarity of picture/video.           		"	1
	samsung ln40a550 40-inch 1080p lcd hdtv.	1
	"great tv - perfect for our bedroom - outstanding picture - very happy with purchase, shipping, quick & careful delivery.           		"	1
	love my samsung lcd!.	1
	i did alot of research before i settled on the samsung, including playing around with my friends' lcds (aquos).	1
	i loved the sharp aquos too but the samung just had a bit of extra appeal... and it sold for a bit less than the aquos.	1
	it also looks better and the swivel stand is, i think, beter.	1
	amazon's delivery was excellent, the delivery man took the tv out of the box, inspected it, and set it up for me.	1
	the color presets work great for me and i haven't had to do much in the way of adjustment.	1
	i am starting to play with the settings a bit more now, and explore the features, and so far, so good, though the one silly thing is, i cannot figure out what the back panel thing is for, and the plug is too short!	1
	"but my wii is happy....           		"	1
	samsung 40 in lcd tv.	1
	have thus far been very pleased with the samsung 40 in lcd tv.	1
	my sony 42 in projection tv went black after five years and the cost of repairs to replace a thing called a 'white engine' exceded the total cost of the of the new samsung.	1
	delivery was speedy and setup was easy requiring an additional cable (purchased at radio shack).	1
	"my sattelite plan does not include high definition but those shows broadcast in hd and converted to digital have almost the same quality on my new samsung saving me a considerable sum on my monthly bill.           		"	1
	not impressed.	1
	i've had the tv for a month now, and i can honestly say that i'm not impressed with it.	1
	part of the problem is that my tv has one of the known samsung defects - it switches itself on and off without my input.	1
	that problem is actually getting worse in that it keeps doing it repeatedly (off on off on...) until i unplug it.	1
	sometimes i can watch for as much as 30 minutes before it starts this behavior, but i know it's coming.	1
	oh, and when it starts doing it, none of the buttons on the remote control work and none of the buttons on the tv work.	1
	the only option is to unplug the tv.	1
	but that's not the only reason for my 1-star review (it's part of it).	1
	i know electronics can be a hit or miss proposition, and all manufacturers will produce a defective unit now and then.	1
	i get that.	1
	amazon will take the tv back because i called within 30 days, but i have to give samsung the chance to fix it first.	1
	they don't seem to be in a big rush in getting a repair person to my house, although that could be the fault of the local repair shop.	1
	in any case, i wait...                      beyond the defective unit i received, the tv itself is nothing special.	1
	if it's your first hdtv, you'll likely be blown away by the improvement.	1
	if you already own another hdtv, you may be underwhelmed.	1
	let's face it, the picture is supposed to be awesome and most hdtvs will deliver that much.	1
	what i don't like about the tv is how it's made.	1
	the casing is incredibly cheap plastic that actually looks nice, but it reflects every bit of ambient light in the room (shiny black - good luck getting finger prints off of it).	1
	what good is a perfect picture when you can vividly see windows and lamps in the frame around the picture?	1
	the tv is also flimsy!	1
	you can actually affect the picture by putting light pressure on the casing with your finger, as i discovered while adjusting the tv on the wall mount.	1
	lightly touching it in the wrong way will cause a flicker.	1
	i have a panasonic plasma that is built like a tank compared to this model.	1
	the tv's sound is also pretty bad, but that's been mentioned in several reviews so it should come as no surprise.	1
	if you're hooking up home theater surround sound, the sound is probably not going to be an issue.	1
	for my purposes, this is a bedroom tv, so i just wanted to use the internal speaker.	1
	that's probably not going to be an acceptable strategy (and i'm not an audiophile, by any means).	1
	finally, and i may be wrong on this, but i can't find any way to hook up a 'video out' device.	1
	i use a dvd recorder to record television shows on my other tv by running an hdmi connection from the input source to the tv, and then running a 'video out' connection from the tv to the dvd recorder.	1
	this allows you to watch in high definition and record in whatever definition your recorder allows.	1
	theoretically, you can run it all through your home theater receiver and/or run your input to the dvd recorder first, but that simply doesn't work as well as a tv to recorder connection (going through the recorder first basically means you lose the hd of the original broadcast).	1
	to me, that's a shortcoming that does matter since i really didn't want to complicate this tv with a whole home theater setup.	1
	this will also affect anyone still using a vcr who wishes to watch in hd and still have the option to record (in much lower definition).	1
	the variety of inputs is relatively robust, and this model does still include an s-video input on the side (note, the newer model samsungs do not have s-video inputs).	1
	oh well, the tv doesn't work yet anyway, and i'm sort of hoping samsung can't fix it so i can return it to amazon and buy another panasonic (no i don't work for panasonic, either).	1
	update:  samsung finally got back to me about fixing my tv.	1
	they said i qualified for in-home repair, which they would arrange.	1
	then the repair person called me and said that they don't do in-home repair, so i'd have to box up the tv and bring it in to their shop.	1
	since i was boxing it up anyway, i called amazon and they said to ship it back for a replacement or refund.	1
	i chose the refund because i plan to buy a better tv.	1
	"5 stars for amazon, no stars for samsung.           		"	1
	somewhat disappointed.	1
	i was very disaaaponted in this tv.	1
	i had searched around for some time looking for a samsung that provided an excellent picture and some extras, specifically pict.	1
	in pict.	1
	while this tv is advertised with this feature, it is never mentioned anywhere that it only works with an analog signal.	1
	now analog signals are are no longer going to be available and in some cases they have already stopped transmitting them.	1
	i also contacted samsung and their response was that is the way the set is designed.	1
	also the function is buried about 3 layers down in the menu.	1
	not very convenient.	1
	in addition the remote for this tv only works if you were directly in front of the set.	1
	"excellent picture but very poor sound.           		"	1
	worth the wait.	1
	i have searched like many of you and also waited for the prices to drop.	1
	the 550 42 inch samsung hdtv is the best that i have seen for the money.	1
	it is a clear, trouble free tv.	1
	although i have only had it for 6 weeks i have enjoyed evry minute.	1
	"i strongly recomend it.           		"	1
	purchased it as a gift.	1
	it was for my brother, i wanted something that inexpensive and cool.	1
	i don't know what to say, the quality is amazing, and he did not start using hdmi until a month ago.	1
	all i have to say for that price, you can't go wrong, and its dropping.	1
	a year ago it was $1,049.98 with free shipping.	1
	"you can't go wrong with this you just can't.           		"	1
	very satisfied.	1
	i purchased this tv for my daughter's new apartment.	1
	she is totally                      happy and with an amazing picture, i am also satisfied.	1
	"the delivery                      person was very friendly and professional.           		"	1
	love samsung products.	1
	bought the samsung 46' last year and when i was looking for a new lcd for the bedroom, did not hesitate to order this one.	1
	picture quality is great (and we have a lousy cable company), all in all, a good choice.	1
	my only complaint is with amazon.	1
	"a week after i received the unit, they lowered the price another $40!           		"	1
	great tv, a must-buy.	1
	i have own this tv for 4 months now and i can say that it is my best buy on amazon ever.	1
	i haven't had any single problem with it yet and love everything about it!	1
	i would like to say something about the price since it seems like our review are based on a product performance and the amount of money we spend to get that performance.	1
	"had i spent $200 more on this tv, maybe i would have expected a lot more from it : maybe for a better sound for example but for the price i bought it ($850 or a little less) i think i feel comfortable able investing in a home theater to get the most out of the hd experience!           		"	1
	samsung ln40a550.	1
	the product is more than i ever expected.	1
	i'm using it in a second home and only have a small digital/hd antenna.	1
	the picture quality is exceptional.	1
	can't wait to have satellite input to expand it's capabilities.	1
	the hd by airwave is unbelievable.	1
	"no doubt the best tv i've ever owned.           		"	1
	great tv at a great price!.	1
	just before christmas, our 6 year old panasonic projection was dying a horrible death, so the hubby and i decided to start looking for its replacement.	1
	we had been to several electronics stores, checking online, comparing pictures and prices of many sets.	1
	we decided on a samsung 40 inch, but the prices were out of our range.	1
	we kept looking and kept waiting.	1
	finally, i found this model at a price we could afford and jumped on it ([...]).	1
	once it arrived (love the free shipping through pilot!)	1
	i was able to hook it up within a matter of minutes while hubby was at work, and my son and i were watching television.	1
	wow!	1
	the colors are bright and no matter where you sit in my living room, you can see the screen clearly, unlike our old projection.	1
	i agree with other reviewers about the sound quality being lackluster, so we will be purchasing a surround sound system in the near future.	1
	overall, i highly recommend the samsung brand and, in particular, this television to anyone looking to purchase an lcd hdtv.	1
	"i am so glad we purchased this great tv, and we are planning on enjoying it for a long time!           		"	1
	turns on and off by itself.	1
	i bought this tv a little more than month ago from bestbuy.	1
	i was very impress with the picture quality, my eyes were glued to the screen, the clarity and color was amazing after i change around the picture setting.	1
	until a few weeks ago the tv turned off by it self and it turned on again after about 2 seconds.	1
	i thought i did something wrong with my set up.	1
	i went over the set up all over again according to the manual, but it is still happening.	1
	until one night it happened twice about 30 minutes apart, and i decided to exchange it with the same exact model.	1
	however, after about 2 weeks it happened again!!!!	1
	twice in a row two different tvs???	1
	are you kidding me??	1
	i thought samsung tv suppose to be one of the best???	1
	i took it back and bought samsung ln40b530 instead, a lower model but newer.	1
	so far, it works just fine, and picture quality is just as amazing.	1
	don't buy this tv, save your time and money for other model!	1
	"!           		"	1
	i can get some satisfaction.	1
	i've been looking at hd tv's for  a year.	1
	i was weary of discussing pros and cons with sales people who seemed weary of their jobs and provided little info.	1
	luckily, my daughter's significant other took the time to sit with me and go over the pros and cons of various tvs and which bells and whistles did i need and which were overkill.	1
	then he told me what a great experience he had buying from amazon.	1
	so i tried it and i was thoroughly impressed.	1
	my 40' samsung                      is terrific, delivery was quick and efficient, and there was no shipping charge!	1
	"now, if we could just get our government to run as effeciently as amazon...           		"	1
	totally satisfied: great t-v, great price, great service.	1
	after months of indecision, amazon's great price and free shipping got me off the dime on this and i'm so glad.	1
	i have hdtv service from my time-warner and made connection with hdmi, and am absolutely delighted with the picture.	1
	the sound is very good from the t-v, much better than average, and more than  adequate for news, talk, etc., but for other content i crank up my home theatre.	1
	performance out of the box was very good.	1
	as i tweak a little here and there, we've moved up to excellent.	1
	absolutely spectacular picture on hd source, and much better on sd than i had expected.	1
	amazon's free shipping provided a lot more service than i had anticipated.	1
	i expected the box to be dropped in my co-op's receiving room and that i'd have to do the rest.	1
	instead, these guys made a delivery appointment, brought it up to my apartment, unpacked it, and got it going.	1
	they were polite and efficient.	1
	a lot more than i expected for free shipping.	1
	a major bricks-and-mortar retail chain wanted $300 more for the same t-v and $100 more to deliver it.	1
	way to go amazon.	1
	this is my first big-ticket purchase from amazon and i can assure you they have won me over.	1
	"amazon is not just for buying books any more.           		"	1
	very nice hdtv for a great price!.	1
	i researched all over and was set on a 40' v- series sony.	1
	went to a store to see it in person and this samsung 40' 550 was $400 cheaper and stole the show.	1
	then looked online and found a great deal here.	1
	my only gripe was the shipping took about a week longer than promised.	1
	"but this deal and tv is worth the wait.           		"	1
	disappointed, frustrated, and upset.	1
	developed orange and red streaks after 3 months covering half the screen.	1
	serviceman says something must have hit it from outside but no outward sign                      of damage -not a scratch.	1
	still samsung will not repair or replace.	1
	they say physical damage is not                      covered under warranty.	1
	"i swear that we did not do anything to it but they                      don't care so i'm out a thousand dollars.           		"	1
	excellent price - good tv.	1
	i ordered on a friday morning, recieved the tv via pilot air frieght on the following tuesday.	1
	delivery was no-hassle and on time.	1
	tv looks good out of box after i did some tweaking (thanks avs forums!).	1
	i got this deal when amazon briefly lowered the price so it was a hell of a deal.	1
	i did a lot of research before buying a tv, and this one had great reviews on cnet and various other sites.	1
	one thing i found out later was that samsung sends these reviewers panels that are made in the samsung factory called 's' panels.	1
	these are usually far superior to the panels that samsung outsources to third parties, 'c' and 'a' panels.	1
	sadly i got a 'c' panel, and it definaltey doesnt have the clarity of the 's' panel on display at costco.	1
	while i got a great deal on this tv, and the picture is still good and i'm happy with the purchase, i'll probably not buy another samsung tv because of this issue.	1
	its basically a crapshoot on what kind of panel you'll get, and no way to tell until you take the tv out of the box.	1
	"if you're on the fence about the ln40a550 vs. tv x i would go to youtube and search 's' panel vs 'c' panel and look at the demo that was created and you get the idea.           		"	1
	excellent low budget lcd.	1
	been looking for a lcd 40-46' for almost a year...waiting for a great deal on a lnxxa650 or higher model.	1
	came across this ln40a550 when comparing screens and options at a local retailer and decided that i would be willing to save some $$ to replace our old standard tv.	1
	delivery was great.	1
	they helped unbox and gave a few pointers as well.	1
	waited a few hours and powered it up.	1
	what a great picture!!	1
	the size was perfect for our room.	1
	just simple plug and play setup.	1
	"definitely would recommend this to others looking for a low cost lcd with lots of features.           		"	1
	samsung lna40550.	1
	beautiful picture, lots of features.	1
	great television!	1
	great service from vendor.	1
	product was in my home a week after ordering.	1
	white glove delivery - television was brought into my home and he helped me get it into place.	1
	he waited to make sure it was working correctly before leaving.	1
	"would definitely purchase from this vendor again!           		"	1
	i am loving it!.	1
	graduated from a sony wega 24' to this tv, so obviously am mighty impressed.	1
	the picture quality is amazing on hd tv channels and watching movies is a pleasure on this tv.	1
	the tv itself looks great even when off, is light weight and the swivel feature is nice.	1
	love the support for almost all type of inputs - hdmi, co-axial, vga, optical, s-video  etc etc.	1
	what could have been better is the overall sound quality and close captioning support through hdmi (not sure if this is a tv constraint or hdmi constraint).	1
	amazon's shipping (outsourced to third party i guess) was amazing.	1
	they called to confirm delivery time and were punctual, neat and set up my tv in a matter of minutes.	1
	"overall - great value for price i paid!           		"	1
	tv works great, shipping was the worst experince i've ever had.	1
	the only reason there are 2 stars removed from my review is the nightmare on the shipping end of this transaction.	1
	after purchasing this item i recieved a confirmation email and one that said the estimated delivery date was a week later which was fine, then that weekend i checked the tracking of my purchase with the link provided in the confirmation email , the link had shown that it was attempted to be delivered to my house the day before( at a time when i was home and there was no attempt).	1
	after phone call after phone call and being told it will be delivered tomorrow over and over it finally showed up 4 days after the estimated date.	1
	"other than that the tv works great , sound is good quality w/ even just the tv speakers that are on the bottom edge of the tv ( we mounted ours on the wall so speaker 'muffle' is a non issue).           		"	1
	very pleased.	1
	sports have never looked so good, even live!	1
	the samsung is living up to the excellent reviews with these exceptions: the sound is not good, so i purchased a pair of speakers which make a huge difference.	1
	also, if you're not looking at the picture from right in front, the color looks washed out, but i understand that goes with lcd (vs plasma).	1
	"i originally looked at 32' and 37', coming from an old-fashioned 27' analog model, but i'm glad i stepped up to the 40'--the perfect size for the room and the distance to the sitting area.           		"	1
	great tv, but....           i purchased the ln40a550 through amazon.	1
	shipping and delivery was very smooth and without incident.	1
	i am very pleased with the hd picture through a hdmi connection to my cable box and also the component connection to my dvd player.	1
	i have watched a bunch of hockey games in hd and the picture holds up well with the fast pace of the game.	1
	i especially like the pre-programmed picture settings for sports, movies, etc.	1
	the settings seem to be endless.	1
	you could customize the picture any way you want.	1
	the remote is backlit, great for low light operation.	1
	i have not experienced any hdmi issues that other reviews have indicated.	1
	many reviews have given the sound quality a poor rating.	1
	i agree the audio could be a lot better, but using my audio system most of time the tv audio does not affect me.	1
	when changing channels that have different resolutions (ie.	1
	720p to 1080i) the screen goes black for a few seconds.	1
	one problem that has bothered me since i hooked up the tv is the white light 'leak' at the corners, which is only visible on dark scenes or when i use 4:3 to watch standard def programs.	1
	for a company that has been making lcd's for a long time i wouldn't expect this type of problem.	1
	my 26' maxent lcd that i have had for over 3 years never had this type of problem.	1
	"i have contacted samsung and will post their reply when i receive it.           		"	1
	great value - nice looking tv!.	1
	we purchased this tv and amazon's shippers ceva set it up on april 10, 2009.  the shipping company was 2 hours late but that's for another review!	1
	this tv looks really nice!	1
	i recalibrated the settings according to avs forum so i could compare, but i have to say the factory settings are very nice too.	1
	they are just a little bright.	1
	the tv hooked up in seconds.	1
	we do not have hd in the house yet and the standard coaxial cable still looks very nice.	1
	dvds look outstanding.	1
	previous reviews state the sound it bad, and it is...really bad.	1
	it is hollow sounding.	1
	i hooked up to the surround system so no worries.	1
	i think we got a great deal for less than $800!	1
	"i look forward to using this tv for many years!           		"	1
	great experience.	1
	the samsung ln40a550 40' is great.	1
	the picture is incredibly sharp and the colors are perfect.	1
	also, the experience of ordering through amazon (free shipping-hooray)and delivery via pilot was perfect.	1
	pilot calls ahead to arrange a convenient date for delivery and 2 very nice guys brought it in the house, opened the box and waited for us to inspect before leaving.	1
	"i highly recommend this tv and ordering through amazon.           		"	1
	excellent tv!!.	1
	the samsung ln40a550 is an excellent television.	1
	"after doing a lot of research i decided to purchase this tv and it is exactly what i expected.           		"	1
	samsung ln40a550.	1
	i just got this and love it.	1
	getting it here was a mess as i live in montana, it took 15 days and i had to travel 120 miles to pick it up.	1
	if i didnt make the trip it was going to take an additional 7 days to get it delivered.	1
	this is my first hdtv, i only have std cable and i'm very impressed with the qualilty of the picture.	1
	i cant wait to see what it will do with upconverting or blue-ray.	1
	i have read several reviews that said the sound is sub par.	1
	"i have found that if you do some adjusting its just fine.           		"	1
	great picture but not so good sound.	1
	i have been using the tv for just 2 days.	1
	here is my first impression.	1
	picture - excellent for hd content like over the air hd channels.	1
	it is also excellent when connected to my 1080p up-converting panasonic dvd player using hdmi.	1
	not so good for standard definition tv channels that transmit 480i.	1
	audio - good for over the air channels.	1
	poor when dvd player is connected (i haven't tried to adjust the bass/treble though.	1
	i will have to find out if there is a way to adjust those)                      physical appearance - not very impressed.	1
	just plain styling.	1
	wide frame.	1
	remote control - very good.	1
	easy to operate.	1
	shipping from amazon - excellent.	1
	got 3 days earlier.	1
	got in 5 days with free standard shipping.	1
	"misc - haven't got a chance to connect pc and use usb port.           		"	1
	awesome.	1
	first off, i have to congratulate amazon on their prompt and superb (i repeat-superb) service.	1
	tv came earlier than the earliest projected delivery date, and the delivery man helped me up to the third floor and offered to set it up.	1
	he even refused the tip!	1
	tv was perfect.	1
	no dead pixels/screen cracks/anything.	1
	the clarity is incredible.	1
	the size is also larger than i anticipated.	1
	i'm actually on my pc (which i now have multiple monitors on, thanks to a dvi to hdmi converter [also bought on amazon]) writing this review.	1
	the setup was painless and it automatically detected all available channels.	1
	the speakers aren't that bad unless you're audio-obsessed.	1
	i'm going to hook the tv up to my surround sound when those cables come in the mail.	1
	i have a wii and ps3 hooked up to it.	1
	both look absolutely outstanding via the hdmi cable for the ps3 and component cables for the wii (yet again, also ordered on amazon).	1
	the blacks are deep and the color is acute on every source i've tried.	1
	the panel is clear and the frame is not distracting like some of the touch of colors can be.	1
	the remote is responsive and feels well-constructed (comes with batteries included).	1
	personally, i don't like 120 hz because it kind of just hurts my brain to look at it, so i saved money and am happy with the results.	1
	"this is a great buy... so buy it.           		"	1
	samsung hdtv is tops.	1
	i could not be more pleased with my new samsung 40-inch lcd hdtv.	1
	i had no trouble setting it up, and it was beautiful from the very first moment i turned it on.	1
	then a week later i had at&t;'s u-verse fibre-optic service installed replacing my cable service.	1
	"the picture is even more incredible than i ever thought it could be.           		"	1
	wonderful tv.	1
	i have been watching this tv on amazon for the last 3 months and finally ordered it and received it 4 days later.	1
	i couldn't decide if a 40 inch would be too big for a small sized bedroom but after unboxing it and setting it up, i couldn't be happier.	1
	the picture is great.	1
	the sound is what i was expecting and i am not at all disappointed.	1
	tried watching regular dvd's and they look great.	1
	xbox 360 games look amazing.	1
	waiting on my hd receiver to be delivered today and i probably won't be leaving the bedroom for the next few days.	1
	the price and features can't be beat even by sony which this tv is now replacing.	1
	"from the bad reviews i have read about this tv, most seem like user error and/or inexperience with new technology.           		"	1
	very good tv.	1
	the picture is excellent.	1
	the sound needed some adjusting to sound decent.	1
	if you plan on connecting your own speakers you should be fine.	1
	"overall an excellent value for the price.           		"	1
	great for the price.	1
	this tv is as good as i expected.	1
	picture quality is great.	1
	some said that the sound was bad, but i have no problems with the sound quality.	1
	"it looks great and works well in a smaller living room.           		"	1
	awesome picture.	1
	arrived 3 days earlier than estimate.	1
	delivery guy offered to help me set it up, but i just took it out of the box (which had no apparent damage) and made sure there was no damage to the set inside.	1
	beautiful picture.	1
	not enough superlatives to describe it.	1
	watched the masters golf on it and was just blown away.	1
	had it hooked up to my surround system and running through its set-up in about 10 minutes.	1
	all i had to do was plug it in and plug in the hdmi cable from my satellite receiver.	1
	cabinet looks great.	1
	some people have too much money to play with.	1
	why would you pay a couple of hundred more to change the piano black to red touch of color?	1
	played with some of the settings so that it looked good to me.	1
	if i couldn't make it look better left the factory settings.	1
	will be tweaking them further later.	1
	like the swivel base as i have bought a corner entertainment center for it to sit on instead of wall mounting it.	1
	i paid 799.98 which was one cent cheaper than best buy but i would have had to make 120 mile round trip to pick it up.	1
	amazon....free shipping.....no brainer.	1
	buy it, but get the price at what you want to pay for it.	1
	i watched the price go up and down for two weeks before it finally dropped to what i clicked on.	1
	went from 799.99 all the way up to 925.00.  newer model already out.	1
	it's more expensive and has more bells and whistles.	1
	i liked this models oval base better than the newer ones square (rectangular) one.	1
	not sure the new base swivels.	1
	"doesn't matter if you are going to hang it on a wall.           		"	1
	great tv.	1
	this tv is a great value for the money.	1
	the menu system is easy to use.	1
	the colors are vivid.	1
	"it has a nice variety of useful options.           		"	1
	pure cap.	1
	if you like the sound gong off, or the picture going off, or thr whole thing dying completely, then this is the boat anchor for you.	1
	complete trash, and they won't back it up.	1
	"stay away from samsung rip-off artists           		"	1
	great tv.	1
	i waited for a good deal on this and picked it up 2 weeks ago for $760.	1
	can't beat the price and the tv is great.	1
	"delivery was faultless too.           		"	1
	great tv.	1
	"this is an excellent product, and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a television!           		"	1

	"simply amazing                      ps3 looks good                      watching tv looks good                      with that being said this lcd comes highly recommended           		"	1
	excellent tv!.	1
	this tv is fantastic.	1
	samsung is the way to go if you go for lcd.	1
	warehousedeals had an amazing price and since it's through amazon you know it's reliable.	1
	the delivery was fast and thorough.	1
	"just a pleasure overall!           		"	1
	t.v..           i am enjoying my new tv.	1
	"could not be happier with the speed and personal touch when it was delivered to my home.           		"	1
	hdtv.	1
	this is an excellent product.	1
	amazon was amazing.	1
	delivered when promised in perfect shape.	1
	"i'm extremely satisfied.           		"	1
	great tv for the price.	1
	first, i have to give 5 stars just to amazon for their excellent service as always (fully supports their great review in a recent businessweek issue).	1
	the tv shipped quickly and was in my bedroom within 5 working days (the attitude of the delivery person left something to be desired, but i'll leave that out).	1
	this tv is for the bedroom and the first day our eyes were hurting thanks to the bright, sharp and vivid picture.	1
	we are used to a 42' in the living room which was a dlp, so this took some getting used to.	1
	after turning down the backlight, it was perfect.	1
	i have to admit that i have seen slightly sharper picture, but its usually in tv's that cost at least $400 more (for same size), but for our bedroom it is perfect (and huge).	1
	i prefer to watch tv on this one than my sony dlp which is also a very high quality hdtv.	1
	after doing a lot of research online and seeing the tv in stores, we finally decided to go for this one and glad we did.	1
	"you will not regret getting this tv and amazon has the best price.           		"	1
	very pleased.	1
	excellent tv.	1
	delivery and setup was on time, quick and professional.	1
	amazon rocks.	1
	you can't beat amazon's price, especially compared to traditional brick and mortar stores.	1
	"i will say that i'm a bit overwhelmed with all of the calibration options on the tv -- i'd appreciate guidance (from samsung or whoever) on the best way to tweak these options...           		"	1
	looks great, works great.	1
	i replaced my 37' olevia with this samsung model and after one month, have been extremely pleased.	1
	1) the lcd screen is vibrant and sharp, using a progressive scan up-converting dvd player or hdtv broadcasts.	1
	i haven't felt the need to invest in blue-ray yet as i am completely satisfied with my current picture.	1
	2) the dtv tuner works much better than the old olevia (i use a simple rabbit ears to pull in  crystal clear hdtv broadcasts).	1
	3) channels change quickly, though it is good to go through and siphon out unwanted tv stations from the channel list after scanning as this box will pick up a few dozen digital broadcast tv stations.	1
	4) the delivery service that amazon contracts carried the box in, set it up, and verified that it works, quickly and without problem.	1
	5) the hdmi connection works great with both my sony and denon up-converting dvd players.	1
	"i've tried both.           		"	1
	lcd tvs have bad color!.	1
	here is the summary:                      1.  amazon delivery service was awesome!	1
	2.  samsung makes probably some of the best lcd hdtvs you can buy, but...                      3.  if you are coming from a crt edtv or hdtv, you will be dissappointed.	1
	lcd tvs don't have near the color accuracy of crt (the best), or even plasma tv (very good).	1
	no matter how much time you spend calibrating the color with signals, and test disks, and test images from computer, etc, etc, you will at best get a picture that has about 30-50% correct color and the rest will be a slightly 'off' hue which will forever distract your mind in trying to figure out, but it won't quite be able to.	1
	i compared by watching the same content on this tv after i calibrated it as well as possible (samsung has some very good controls for calibrating the tv unlike other brands), with a 2 year old panasonic plasma (720p) and the plasma blew the color accuracy doors off this lcd.	1
	nothing i could do to make the lcd even close.	1
	the plasma has a true '3-d' look to the image, they look life like.	1
	the lcd images just look flat, and ink blotchy.	1
	despite all my calibration, once in a while an image will come on the lcd which shows some signs of color banding.... just terrible.	1
	"unfortunately no one makes a plasma tv smaller than 42' so i had to choose this lcd.           		"	1
	this recent purchase worth every penny.	1
	yes, this is one of the best purchases i made this year.	1
	the price for the size and quality can't be beat anywhere.	1
	it's perfect for someone like me who watches a lot of sports.	1
	my wife is saying i'm not doing anything but watching this tv.	1
	how can i help it?	1
	"i'd give this product 10 stars if i could.           		"	1
	horrible shipping company, great product..           the television is gorgeous and works very well.	1
	the audio quality of the tv, which has been an issue for some review writers, is really not an issue unless you are an audiophile, in which case you probably have surround sound and it really becomes a non-issue.	1
	the sound quality is completely adjustable if you feel you need to tinker with it.	1
	as for the shipper, ceva promised that my tv would arrive on a certain day and then it did not.	1
	amazon was willing to compensate me 10% of the purchase price in an amazon gift card.	1
	i ended up getting it a week after it was supposed to be there.	1
	"not amazon's fault, but they took the fall.           		"	1
	done with sony.	1
	two cameras, two computers and 50' tv manufactured by sony in the last 3 years all had serious defects.	1
	sony did repair free.	1
	this samsung tv is fabulous.	1
	easy to setup and use.. plus it was less costly than sony tv of similar specs.	1
	"we are totally pleased with samsung.           		"	1
	samsung has done it again.	1
	i shopped around for a long time, but finally came to the conclusion that with all variables taken into account (size, contrast ratio, response time, cost) a full hd, 1080p samsung with 30,000:1 contrast ratio at the price you can find this at (less than $800 if you look around) is simply outstanding.	1
	bottom line: the price to product ratio for 40' samsungs is 5-star.	1
	"the price differential for televisions even slightly larger just isn't worth it.           		"	1
	samsung 40' lcd, model ln40a550.	1
	the product is great and your delivery service was great.	1
	i have had the set for about a month and i can't be more pleased.	1
	"now my wife wants another one but she will have to wait.           		"	1
	best for the buck.	1
	there's a lot of talk about 120 herz, etc.	1
	at 40' you're not going to notice any difference between this and newer models except the $500 you didn't spend.	1
	with a 1080p uploading dvd player or blu-ray, your picture will be better than most movie theaters.	1
	it's got plenty of ports, and you can play with the picture settings, should you desire.	1
	on an hd satellite or cable box, you will notice 'paisley' blacks on the non-hd channels, something not as noticeable if you are just using a regular box.	1
	"at $900, it's the best deal on tvs in the spring of '09.           		"	1
	excellent purchase.	1
	considering it was already on sale, no shipping and handling, and no taxes, you really can't beat buying this tv on amazon.	1
	the tv itself is incredible.	1
	beautiful picture.	1
	perfect for watching dvd's and playing video games.	1
	"if you're in the market for a solid '40 inch hdtv, look no further.           		"	1
	awesome tv.	1
	this tv is really worth the money and has great definition.	1
	"if you are debating on which tv to buy this one will not disappoint.           				"	1
	wonderful tv!!	1
	great service from amazon and pilot delivery.	1
	i ordered the tv on a friday and received it the following tuesday.	1
	the delivery company is great...ken patiently waited while i was delayed in getting home by a slow train.	1
	he was not in a hurry to leave and made sure i had no questions or concerns before he left.	1
	this is my first large order from amazon.	1
	the 40' fit perfectly in my 41' width cabinet.i have cable and the coaxial cable hook up is satisfactory, but i think i'm going to get the hd box in order to get the best picture.	1
	however, the current picture is amazing.	1
	the sound/audio is very good, no complaints.	1
	i strongly recommend ordering this tv from amazon, even if you live in a tiny town far from a big city.	1
	i was most concerned about delivery and set up, there was no need for concern,it was perfect!	1
	thank you for making this so easy.	1
	3/31/09: added hd box and the picture and sound improved dramatically, it's amazing.	1

	outstanding product.	1
	i purchased this samsung tv after reading the very good reviews in consumer reports.	1
	it was rated near the top, and especially in the price range.	1
	i received the tv in about 5 days from order, and was amazed at how well it was packed.	1
	within 15 mins.	1
	i had the system up and running, and i'm actually very technically challenged.	1
	the picture and sound are outstanding -- i'm on a time warner hd system.	1
	"i would recommend this tv to anyone.           		"	1
	good tv for the money.	1
	this is a great tv for the money.	1
	"free shipping really helps too.           		"	1
	excellent tv.	1
	excellent tv for the price!	1
	i just purchased this tv.	1
	after reading many, many reviews and making comparisons, i believe that we found the best hdtv on the market.	1
	we were looking for an hdtv that would provide reliability.	1
	i currently have a smaller sony and ever since its purchase, i have been unhappy with the color and tones and no matter how much i tweaked it, i still cannot get it the way i want.	1
	i thought that ordering hd service would help the sony, but it is not any better than it was with standard service.	1
	here are some pros and one con:                      pros: excellent picture even without a converter/cable box.	1
	we have hd service, but have not used a hd cable box with this tv--just standard service.	1
	menu for tweaking is really easy to navigate and, of course, i tweaked away.	1
	view from any angle is really good--not blurry like other flat screens.	1
	great for playing my wii games.	1
	color and clarity are really nice.	1
	con:                      manual could be a little easier to read.	1
	i had trouble figuring out how to set up the wii (i guess i am tv or manual stupid).	1
	others have complained about the sound, but i must have a 'tin ear' because the speakers sound fine to me.	1
	overall, very pleased with the purchase.	1
	p.s.	1
	don't be surprised if you don't receive complete white glove service because our delivery driver brought the tv in, put in on the floor and 'beat his feet' out the door before i could ask whether or not he was supposed to set the tv up.	1
	it didn't really affect us because we took it right out of the box and hooked up cable.	1
	my sister ordered a size up from this one and her delivery people came in, set it up and made sure it was working before they left.	1
	all depends on the carrier.	1
	"shipping was much faster than anticipated from amazon and we did receive a call from the carrier to let us know when to expect our tv.           		"	1
	backlighting issues.	1
	we had two shipped to use (one was a replacement) and both had backlighting issues.	1
	the corners would be overly bright (as in white).	1
	pressure issue?	1
	not sure.	1
	normally during darker shots it was unavoidable to notice.	1
	i would recommend getting one series newer.	1
	"hopefully they resolved the issue.           		"	1
