	i've now own my genesis 3.8 tech for nearly 6 months.	1
	no problems so far, fit, finish, ride remains top notch.	1
	the exterior design is even better than first thought while the mileage slightly less (lots of city driving) than before.	1
	the integrated bluetooth is used extensively and all autos should have them for safety in today's cell phone culture.	1
	the navigation even easier to use once you know all the short cuts i've had no problems with the suspension and the ride remains a nice balance between soft and hard.	1

	!suggested improvements:cool the front passenger seat.	1
	the dvd will soon be allowed to play during driving for passengers (tech as already been developed for this).	1
	make genesis a sub luxury brand.	1
	all genesis should be sold with wings on hood, trunk and wheels.	1

	i feel very confident on the road.	1
	highway driving is really fun actually with this carsuggested improvements:the rims are a little plain.	1

	i'm kind of a person that likes to buy based on value.	1
	of course, hyundai was the ticket.	1
	though, i was a bit skeptical about the hyundai brand, the genesis shattered my perceptions about the brand.	1
	i can not say how classy the car remains even after a few months of ownership.	1
	put a genesis badge and the car is not that much different from a bentley imo.favorite features:steering wheel has a nice soft touch.	1
	the stereo controls are a simple and intuitive.	1
	the amenities galore, wow.suggested improvements:change the badge to something artistic and symmetrical.	1
	though, i get the two people shaking hands thing with the slanted h, most consumers will not get that esoteric art.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.1....htmlrides too rough.i bought my pre-owned 3.8 from a man who is known to be less than frugal who really 'unloaded' this beauty upon me.	1
	it is a gorgeous car, but after i drove it 850 miles it reminds me of the gorgeous, brainy woman who can't boil water.	1
	only the bmw 318i that i just sold rode worse.	1
	the suspension system is horrible.	1
	when the tires are cold you can feel every tar strip in the highway.	1
	the guys who designed the suspension should not be allowed to graduate fro high school this year.	1
	the steering is also numb and it becomes very tiring to be driving with the intent to find a good centerline feel and have that suspension fighting me.	1
	there is too much road noise being transmitted into the car.favorite features:the design statement, interior feels great.suggested improvements:redesign the whole suspension system.	1
	it rides about as bad as the bmw.	1
	the cup holders are too few in number and poorly placed.	1
	it could use a bluetooth that will download my entire address book.	1
	the one in there is a bit low tech.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.1....htmlworth every pennyi got a genesis for my wife's birthday.	1
	she couldn't be happier with the car.	1
	it was a 3.8 l with plenty of luxury accouterments.	1
	she certainly will drive this baby for the next ten years or so.	1
	it is snowy in michigan, can this thing last in snow.	1
	well, the good thing is that the genesis was fitted with winter tires.	1
	hopefully, the rwd architecture will handle the icy conditions.favorite features:navigation is a breeze to go through.	1
	the styling is classical but understated.	1
	the eight airbags and overall safety features is a + for the wife and kids.suggested improvements:the seats are a little too stiff for my liking.	1
	i generally like plush seats, as in my old american cars.	1
	but that complaint is more of a nitpick.	1
	i'd like to download more media files onto the hard disk of the onboard computer.	1
	the dvd player should play when driving.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.1....htmlhappy with cari needed a new car, since i drive pretty often in the new york metropolitan area.	1
	found this beauty of a car.	1
	the 3.6 l v6 with technology.	1
	i can not find a negative quotient or facet where this car lacks.	1
	it's plenty big, plenty strong and comfortable for the long trips down route 80 and i-95.favorite features:steering feel is ver precise for a hyundai.	1
	the sensitivity of the wheel column makes the driving experience much easier.	1
	the back lit nights during long trips make it look very chic.suggested improvements:heated and cooled seats for both passengers is a suggestion of mine.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlbeginning of a beautiful relationshipyou know, things aren't always what they seem.	1
	i've been driving caddy's for a quite a while in my life time.	1
	i'm an ol timer, not too old.	1
	but i gotta say that this vehicle really took me by surprise.	1
	seeing the way how korea has become a modern country.	1
	i can not be surprised to see the level of development in their car manufacturing.	1
	i got this 3.8 for about 37,500 at iowa city.	1
	it is a great deal.	1
	it reminds me of 1988 all over again.favorite features:the general clean and acceptable interface of the car design.	1
	the outside is bent on telling a person that, i am one serious driving machine.	1
	the inside is a place of nice diversion.	1
	where i can listen quietly to high end classical music.suggested improvements:the ride, as some people say is on the stiffer end.	1
	i lowered the pressure on my tires to improve the ride.	1
	i do insist on hyundai to listen to more customer input regarding ride comfort.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlit's a great vehiclegot this beauty for 38,000 with the tech package.	1
	i couldn't be any happier.	1
	the thing moves and is very nice to be inside.	1
	looking forward to future hyundai vehicles.	1
	especially the equusfavorite features:the heated and cooled seats: rear window shades: cup holders for back seats: luxo-like ride, especially in the back: 293 bhp: 25 mpg in the highwaysuggested improvements:the style is a little derivative.	1
	i like the mercedes like front grill.	1
	but the back looks too much like a bmw.	1
	get some creative s.korean designers to draw the back end.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlthis car is a contenderi got this car yesterday after test driving this vehicle.	1
	i certainly can say that the genesis has a one of a kind personality.	1
	though the car feels much more expensive, with luxurious appointments, the price paid was only 41,500 with all the options laid out.favorite features:bluetooth for multi-tasking and a very easy navigation system.	1
	the car is very comfortable.	1
	and, the back-seat drivers feel chauffeured to their way a destination.	1
	the interior size is truly a nice thing to appreciate extremely safe car.suggested improvements:ummm...... maybe i should have waited for the 2010 genesis.	1
	hyundai is developing a state-of-the-art 6 speed transmission which will be butter smooth.	1
	as well, as more fuel efficient.	1
	the break feel can improve a slight touch.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlincredible car for the moneyhave had mine for only 3 weeks but i am loving this car.	1
	i am constantly being stopped in the parking lot to find out what kind of car it is.	1
	it is roomy, powerful, and luxurious.	1
	i drove lexus e350, infiniti m35, bmw 535 and this.	1
	bought the hyundai the next week and have no regrets.	1
	it stands out in the crowd of those cars on the road and is much less expensive.	1
	the ride quality is excellent in my opinion.	1
	i ride normal roads, some good and some bad, but i don't see where people are coming from in saying the ride quality is bad.	1
	this is a helluva car.favorite features:ac seat, rear camera, lexicon sound system is incredible, powerful engine,quick braking, telescoping headlamps.suggested improvements:address book sync for bluetooth enabled phone.	1
	larger cup holders.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlhomerun of a deali got my 3.8 with the technology package and i can not say enough about the car.	1
	i also deflated the tire pressure to improve passenger comfort.	1
	it is interesting to hear people complain about the suspension, when in fact hondas, mazdas, and now fords ride give me a backache every time i drive one.	1
	the dealership experience was solid.	1
	it felt like i was getting a luxury car at a costco.	1
	there was nothing wrong with the dealers at hyundai.	1
	they treated me well, they knew the details about the genesis.	1
	as well, they did not rush me or push me to make a purchase on the hyundai.favorite features:good interior appointments and bluetooth/mp3 integration.	1
	the navigation system is a breeze to use.	1
	and the car is truly spacious.	1
	good handling car with that independent five link suspension.	1
	the doors slam with a solid thud.	1
	as well the car is very well built.suggested improvements:soften the ride a little bit.	1
	the hyundai engineers should figure a way to create a 2 mode suspension system to give the option to customers for a rider's car or a lounge/cruise car.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlgreat all aroundyou just can't get more car for the buck than the genesis.	1
	i wanted an entry full-size luxury car for a little over $30k, and so my options were limited.	1
	shopped against toyota avalon, a few buick models, ford taurus, even the hyundai azera, and there's no contest here.	1
	of course one can get a used lexus or something, but i wanted a new car, plus hyundai has the great warranty.	1
	and even if i could afford a new lexus es or gs, i'd much rather save the money for gas and go with the no-name genesis.favorite features:ext and int styling.	1
	nothing original, but it's just a good looking car.	1
	also, the engine (v6) is powerful, quiet, and has surprisingly good fuel economy.	1
	also, there's just nothing pretentious about driving a genesis, and i like that.suggested improvements:ride can be a little smoother.	1
	rear- visibility isn't that great, but it seems like the trend these days with smaller windows.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlgreat car.i really love this car.	1
	the price was great.	1
	i got every option you could purchase and it is alot of fun to drive.	1
	the nav system is superior.	1
	i think the nav system is overpriced but worth it for me.	1
	the only complaint i have is about the road noise.	1
	i could really tell the difference between this car and my old car when i went thru the car wash. it was much louder.	1
	my old car was a lincoln ls.	1
	to get a comparable lincoln i would have had to spend about $10,000 more.favorite features:nav system is great and very very easy to learn.	1
	headlights turn with me.	1
	rear camera system.	1
	i have trouble backing up any other car without it.	1
	it is amazing how fast you get use to it.	1
	interior colors get many compliments.	1
	(black and brown) car price was great.suggested improvements:sun visors feel cheap.	1
	less road noise.	1
	everything else is great!	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlsuspension is the problemi just got my car on aug 6th 2009 (manufactured date: july 7th 2009).	1
	in general, i love this car lots.	1
	only thing that ruins this car is its suspension.	1
	it is fun to drive but it is not comfortable with its crappy suspension design.	1
	the 7-speaker system is good.	1
	and trunk, glove box and handrest box are big but no partition at all.	1
	there is no way to organize the items, quite a mess.	1
	many people starred the car while driving.	1
	and it brings some talks with friends and strangers while parking.	1
	water came into trunk when open.	1
	please and please fix the suspension in all effort for the pioneer (who bought the first year genesis) as the compensation.favorite features:1. hid 2. the look (inside and outside) 3. super quiet, loved it so much (hope no rattles in future) 4. cheap insurance (bcos it is hyundai i guess) 5. good value with this kinda price.suggested improvements:1. hyundai should fire the suspension design team or at least the team lead.	1
	2. backseat cannot be folded 3. water comes into trunk when open (i don't believe it, but yah, what a dump design) 4. back to #1, suspension ruins the whole car comfortability.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmla follow up reviewa follow up since my last review back in may.	1
	i now have 2500 miles on it and it is still doing just fine.	1
	this piece of advice may help with those complaining about the hard ride, i just spoke with my hyundai service manager about softening up the ride.	1
	he told me that the car comes from the factory with a hard rubber tire, and that if it had a softer rubber tire on it, it would ride better with less bumps.	1
	i'm not complaining, i still have all the luxury, i still have over $25,000 in my pocket vs owning one of those other high end luxury brands,its cheaper maintance, and everyone still walks around the car admiring it.	1
	i'm just waiting on hyundai to appreciate us genesis's ownersfavorite features:everythingsuggested improvements:no passenger cooled seats	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.2....htmlincredible driving machinei love this car.	1
	i was in the market for a bmw 535i (also considered audi a6 and infinity m35) until test driving the genesis 4.6 with tech package.	1
	power and acceleration are great, delivered smoothly and eagerly.	1
	handling is also very capable considering the large size of the car.	1
	the car is extremely quiet, even with sunroof tilted, making it easy to enjoy the 17-speaker lexicon stereo (with cd/dvd-audio player and mp3/ipod inputs).	1
	fit and finish is excellent, and i really like the clean, intuitive layout and controls.	1
	technology is well integrated and works well (bluetooth, voice recognition, etc.	1
	).favorite features:power and performance, quietness and refinement, fit and finish, lexicon stereo, technology and navigation system, build quality, lots of luxury features (to many to name!	1
	)suggested improvements:a few minor tweaks would make this an even better car: cooled/ventilated seat for passenger (not just driver), address book transfer over bluetooth, and power-folding (not just power tilting) side mirrors.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.3....htmlhigh hopes now back to bmwnothing but praise for the first few thousand miles then occasionally starting goes to about 400 rpm and runs rough.	1
	had to shut down.	1
	access steering would run halfway down and would have to manually reposition it.	1
	rear air would intermittently go to full hot (so much the the center console and side of the drvr seat was hot to touch).	1
	these's a tech order out on the heat but the dealer is not allowed to change the part unless they can duplicate the problem.now the 'new' tau engine is knocking for the first few minutes after start indicating a possible internal lubrication problem (dealer not sure if problem).	1
	first start of the day get out and listen.favorite features:nav system ease of operation and ride comfort.	1
	interior fit and finish.	1
	cockpit control locations.	1
	sound system second to none.suggested improvements:get the engineering right before putting on the mardet.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.3....htmlamazing vehiclei have to admit, i thought i would never buy a hyundai but i just bought one of these and wow, i am amazed by the fit and finish of this car.	1
	i just sold my lexus so i am used to a nice ride but this takes the cake.	1
	the way the car excellerates and handles is very impressive.	1
	i love the quality of this car both in and out.	1
	the controls are very will thought out and every one of them seems to be placed where it needs to be.	1
	i think i am going to enjoy this car for years to come - thank you hyundaifavorite features:it is all in the ride and feel of the car when driving it.	1
	the power of the engine and the quiet ride make this car worth every nickelsuggested improvements:i do have a couple of suggestions for improvement but they are so minor they are almost not worth mentioning.	1
	the passenger seat should be height adjustable.	1
	the front cup holders should be further apart.	1
	there should be a compartment for eyeglasses.	1
	the genesis logo and 6 cd changer on base model.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.3....htmlthis car is sick!hyundai went above and beyond with this car.	1
	too much fun!!!	1
	for the money, there is not a better value on the market, period.	1
	i love the fact that this car is indeed a hyundai, which appeals to a person like myself who wants luxury without the cliche of owning infiniti, mercedes, bmw, etc.	1
	the surprise that comes with the discovery that it's a hyundai is priceless.	1
	i've had a few issues with the afls (adaptive front lighting system) and she was in the shop 3 times in about 2 weeks.	1
	eek!	1
	but that's been the only issue, and considering it's a production model i was expecting a lot worse.	1
	true, it's been less than a month but i don't care, she's here to stay!favorite features:push button start, surround sound, voice activated controls, gps with a yellow pages built into the system so that my car can find my a hotel, restaurant, anything and just take me there; interior, sun roof, auto rear shade, exterior - i love this car!suggested improvements:adaptive cruise control would be a nice perk but overall this is a wonderful car.	1
	would be nice if the phone was able to read text messages aloud (maybe it can and i just haven't discovered it yet...)	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.3....htmlvery poor suspensionthe plain truth about the 2009 genesis is that it has a horrible suspension and rides like an old truck.	1
	you can feel every bump in the road.	1
	i think you could run over a fishing worm and feel it.	1
	this severe defect is not immediately noticeable during a short test drive.	1
	the dealer states that this is designed into the car because it is a high performance automobile.	1
	it is fairly smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets.	1
	the ride is the most important element of a car and it fails my expectations.	1
	i'm not alone in my review of the suspension.	1
	read the hyundai genesis web site for more.	1
	the car is a beautiful car in all other aspects it is fantastic.favorite features:the car's quietness, and the pep of the v8 engine are noteworthy.suggested improvements:replace the suspension system.	1
	it will be the downfall of an otherwise fantastic automobile.	1
	it doesn't rate the title of 'north american car of the year' because of its ride.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.3....htmlluxury at a bargain pricei have had my v6 3.8 purchased with all available options for 4 months (7k miles).	1
	i love this car.	1
	i not had any issues and it is a great value.	1
	i am averaging 23 mpg in mixed driving.	1
	my friends with more expensive cars (e- series, lexus ls, etc.)	1
	cannot believe the bargain.	1
	in fact, my boss just traded in his infinity m45 on a v8 genesis.	1
	claims he saved over $150 per month on his lease and gave up very little in luxury or performance.favorite features:what i like best: - luxurious and roomy interior - the lexicon sound system and the tech package are absolutely awesome.	1
	- the price - quiet ride - the lexicon system (worth repeating- it's that good!suggested improvements:- ability to import phonebook into bluetooth - adaptive cruise control - blind spot monitor - put all features on the passenger seat that come with drivers seat - adjust suspension to reduce bounce at low speeds on uneven roads - improve the dealer experience -not on par with luxury car dealers	1

	i thought it was a new bimmer.	1
	but, to my surprise, it was a hyundai, out of all cars.	1
	that car i saw provoked me to look at the genesis.	1
	i test drove the darn vehicle and i never looked back.	1
	i can say for certain that, like other posters, test driving the genesis is a sure fire way take the hyundai into your garage.favorite features:eerily quiet ride.	1
	i can hear a pin drop on the mat.	1
	the level of strength in the chassis makes it look like tank.	1
	but the surprising revelation is to realize the big genesis is a hauler.	1
	and it can handle like smaller car.	1
	something a bigger car should not be able to do.suggested improvements:i agree with one of the posters here.	1
	some people actually snickered at me, when i told them that it was a korean hyundai.	1
	little do they know that hyundai is a well respected #1 shipbuilding manufacturer.	1
	soon they will climb in the automotive field as well.	1
	change the luxury marque.	1

	the dark secret is that it has horrible suspension and rides like a truck.	1
	this severe defect is not immediately noticeable - the suspension has a dual personality.	1
	it is beautifully smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets.	1
	it is horrible to drive and i regret leasing it.	1
	i am deeply disappointed.	1

	the way it looks, interior appointments, fit and finish, lots of features, lots of room and peppy performance with the refined v6 although it could have a more sensitive throttle.	1
	i love everything about this car, except having to drive it.suggested improvements:if hyundai wants to become a serious player, they need to fix the suspension now.	1

	it's quiet, comfortable, and tons of power.	1
	my only complaint (reason for 9 in comfort) is road noise from the dunlops and a little stiffer ride than i would have expected.	1
	aside from this, it's still one of the quietest cars i've been in.	1

	i don't think it has quite the acceleration of the chrysler, but way more than enough for the traffic situations i drive in.	1
	the hyundai exterior design is not as impressive as the chrysler, but the interior is beautiful.	1

	boy am i glad i bought this instead of the lexus ls 460. same car for 30-40k less.	1
	while the lexus ride is smoother, genesis matches most everything else.	1
	why pay more?	1
	i put the korean badging on it and enjoy watching the rubber-neckers wonder what type of car it is.favorite features:tech package was the best of all the cars i looked at.	1

	my last car was a cady cts and was nice car but way overpriced imo.i got the 6cyl genesis after testing both i went with the 6cyl and its got plenty of power 4me.i got the package that has everything except backup cam and gps,4me it wasn't worth the extra money.i find this car so much fun to drive and am amazed at how many ppl stop me and ask questions,i could be a salesman due to my high praise for this car.after buying cars for 40 years this is the first car i have been so fired up about.cant say enough good things and only have very minor dislikes.favorite features:really hard to say but i guess comfort,style,and sound system is tops.suggested improvements:i live in arizona desert so maybe a higher fan speed on ac.	1

	it's worse than the 1980's gm cars.	1
	the car restarts itself - people really laugh at me when that happens.	1
	the nav sends me into lakes.	1
	the transmission clunks.	1
	the engine stalls pulling out into traffic, which is terrifying.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.5....htmlit is a pleasure to drive this carwe bought this as a second car to our first one being mb gl550 and i have to tell you from interior and performance perspective it is comparable but from technology perspective this car is years ahead of mb.	1
	ride is great, acceleration is awesome - mixed freeway, in-town driving is giving us 18.5-19.5 mpg with only 450 miles on it so farfavorite features:1. technology - bluetooth, navigation 2. comfort feature - where when you turn the car off, seats move back and steering wheel moves us but then when you start it comes back to the last position 3. while reversing, the lines it shows which help you guide through the surrounding is simply greatsuggested improvements:1 would have liked an option to switch between comfort and sports ride as right now it only gives you sports ride 2. ability to sync phone book between phone and the car	1

	the genesis has the exterior styling of much more expensive bmw and lexus sedans and the interior is roomier than the town cars and the q. the back seat leg room is amazing and without skimping on trunk space.	1
	the trunk is half again larger than the q. the v6 has plenty of power and the transmission is as smooth as can be.	1
	my mileage depends on the brand of gas, and i get 29 mpg on brand name regular, and 25.5 on off-brand, a 10% trade off.	1
	the q was 20 mpg on premium.favorite features:the comfort & ride, the power, the mileage on regular gas, and the luxury looks inside and out.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.7....htmlso far extremely satisfied...i have owed a volvo s-80 2002 purchased that year and wanted to change it for a 2009 until i saw the comments written on edmunds, about the genesis.	1
	my wife and i went on a test drive and we enjoyed so much the drive and the comfort that we bought it when we got back to the dealership and at a price nearly 16000.00 less than a volvo s-80 2009.i'm being congratulated continuously by people seeing it for the 1st time.	1
	the value of this genesis is outstanding.favorite features:stereo, backup cameras and parking sensors and most of all comfort.suggested improvements:replace ashtray by something else.	1

	the 3.8 has great acceleration and should satisfy most drivers.	1
	the gas mileage, well i have to keep checking it to make sure it is right!	1
	my wife drives mostly in town with a few highway trips and is getting 24 mpg on average.	1
	a quick 300 mile trek jumped it up to 28 mpg.	1
	i see other complaints about the suspension but we are pleased with our car; the wind and bumpy roads do not affect the ride that much and is an exceptionally quiet ride.	1
	my inlaws dumped their 2 year old lexus after riding with my wife on that 300 mile trip.	1
	if you just have to have the snob appeal and want to pay 20-30 grand more for the same lux then have at it.favorite features:tech package, the nav system takes us to the front door of most places and the lexicon stereo rocks...literally rocks the car when the woofer is cranked up!the most fav is all the folks looking at the car when i come out of the store and say...wow, what is this?!	1
	white satin paint is flawless!suggested improvements:the technology package is not user friendly and the books could be more intuitive!	1
	put ac in the passenger seat.drivers seat can use more bolstering and a tad more adjustment for us big guys.	1

	quality is good.	1
	the only problem i have noticed so far is the tracking at highway speeds is a bit loose - that is, it wanders off desired track easily and steering is a little twitchy, especially in even a slight cross wind.	1
	i haven't driven it enough to develop an opinion about the gas mileage, reliability or other operation aspects.favorite features:suggested improvements:for luxury items : i would like to have onstar and collision mitigation system rather than back up camera.	1

	waited a couple of days went to test drive it again and was still stunned how well it drove and how great it made me feel.	1
	i just had to have it, a total no brainer for me - got the 4.6 tech.	1

	personally, i think it is close to perfect.	1
	i find most luxury cars too soft with the handling and this car corners flat with predictable handling while not losing a luxury feel.	1
	it does have a tendency to porpoise a bit and there is room for improvement there.	1
	the thought given to this car and what is important to the driver is exceptional.	1
	i love most of the interior except the seats and headroom.	1
	i am 6' 5' and i feel the seat needs to be lowered or have some padding removed.	1
	the seats should also be bigger offering some lateral support.	1
	overall this is a winner for hyundai and if they listen to consumers it can only get better.favorite features:handling with predictable and responsive driving.	1
	aluminum and leather interior (need more of this).	1
	ipod, aux, and usb inputs.suggested improvements:fix 'porpoising', needs bigger seats w/lateral support, seats need the ability to lower more (headroom issues), trunk should automatically open *completely* like a mercedes, gas cap door is made of flimsy plastic, more wood and less leather for the steering wheel	1

	it is a great car and excellent value for the money compared to mb,bmw and lexus.	1
	i've put 6500 miles on the car and the only thing that i don't like about the car is the jittery, bumpy ride on uneven roads, it is fine on the highways and on smooth streets.	1
	i live in south florida and the secondary roads here are pretty good compared to areas that get bad weather, however any imperfection on a road and this car goes into convulsions.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.8....htmlterrible rideat first glance it looks like a lot for the money but on closer inspection the interior is cheaply constructed, you cannot transfer the phone book from your cell phone and the seats have no real lateral support.	1
	but all of this pales in the face of the terrible suspension.	1
	the ride is rough and jittery with a tendency towards porpoising on almost all surfaces, even those that appear to be smooth and or recently paved.	1
	i would test drive the heck out of a potential purchase and if you experience the slightest bit of what i have described, pass on it and look at something else.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.9....htmlfirst week of owning new genesishaving owned virtually every german and japanese make on the market, i decided in today's economy, practicality should win out over creature comforts and german engineering.	1
	after owning a genesis 3.8 for just one week, i am convinced that while my decision was certainly practical, i will not lose out on creature comforts, performance or quality.	1
	this car is an absolute winner and every time i get into it, i smile knowing that it will cost me less than half the cost of my e320 over the life of the car and i can honestly say that it has better features, comfort, style and performance.	1
	this car is a winner and if hyundai can get the suspension right, they will really be on to something big.favorite features:tech system navigation is second to none, sound system and bluetooth handsfree system is far superior to toyota and benz.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.9....htmlit's a keeper!only having the car for less than a week makes it difficult to offer critique that might affect someone's buying decision.	1
	however, i am so impressed with how this car feels and performs that i am compelled to write something.	1
	prior to making this purchase, i checked every available review, both professional and consumer, and i shopped every available source.	1
	when it became clear that this car was one that i should strongly consider, i agonized over whether i would buy a 3.8 or 4.6 variant.	1
	for the difference in price, i am happy with my choice although both cars are winners.	1
	i have owned a stable of fine cars over the years, and, hyundai just didn't appeal to me...until now!favorite features:the lexicon stereo system melts the senses.	1
	the fuel economy for such a heavy, high-horsepower vehicle is absolutely amazing.	1
	the absence of noise of any kind is a true delight, and, the way this car 'feels' its way around the road is eerily similar to a porsche i once owned.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.9....htmlbeware a bumpy ridei just leased a base model genesis a week ago.	1
	sadly i like everything about it except the suspension.	1
	when i first test drove it, i noticed it was a bit bumpy, but i thought maybe it was because of the road i was on.	1
	i also noticed a few reviews mentioned bumpiness.	1
	but when i test drove it the second time it felt ok so i went ahead and leased it.	1
	after i took it home, i started feeling that the bumpiness was quite pronounced and at times jarring.	1
	i often find myself getting bumped up out of my seat, akin to the feeling of airplane turbulence.	1
	the vehicle has an odd combination of soft and hard ride.	1
	it feels cushy on a perfectly smooth road, but imperfections make the ride feel very bumpy.favorite features:attractive inside and out; good fit and finish; good smell; nice instrument panel; big trunk; smooth transmission; quiet; good safety features (not too many cars have both head curtain and airbag for the rear seats); spacious front and back seats; temperature control panel for rear passengers.suggested improvements:suspension needs big improvement (see comments above); water leaks into trunk when open wet trunk door; base model steering wheel should also telescope; volume control on radio should be continuously adjustable (lowest volume increment is not low enough); seat uncomfortable (due to lack of depth?)	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.9....htmllisten to my wordsgreat car, much greater than my previous avalon.. actually, uncomparable..., im sorry.	1

	it is a very stylish car and the interior is beautiful.	1

	there are a few kinks that still have to be worked out with mine.	1
	after having the tires balanced it is still rough on the interstate.	1
	the brakes still screech when i back out of the garage.favorite features:the responsiveness of the v8, the expensive looking body style, the tech package, and the interior make this an enviable car.suggested improvements:many of the cars it is capable of competing with have all wheel drive, it should also.	1
	the side view mirrors are so high that they block the view of cars at an intersection and make left hand turns very hard to judge, frankly i'm surprised it passes safety tests.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlmy genesisi tinted the windows and added blind side mirrors on both exterior mirrors as i like to switch lanes quickly.	1
	this car is the best car i have ever bought.	1
	i compared it against the cadillac, maxima, lexus es350 and acura tl and like this car the best.	1
	my kids wanted me to buy another chrysler 300c but was sold on the rear leg room once they got to go for a test drive in my genesis.favorite features:love the smooth acceleration, the sound system and heated/cooled seats.suggested improvements:give us the option to remove the h on the trunk.	1
	i am glad the superbowl commercial made this car seem high end and changed the perception of hyundai.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlbest valuei bought v-6 in october 2008. i drove mb & lexus in the past.	1
	this is absolutely much better car than mb and lexus if you take the price into consideration.	1
	if you are willing to pay $ 20 or 30 k more just for the brand, go ahead but i really recommend this car why you waste hard earned money, especially under a current economic situation.	1
	again, this car is equal to or better than mb or lexus in all respects except for a hugh price difference.	1
	i am telling you that if your are looking for a new car, buy this car, you will nor regret.favorite features:engine is so quite and v-6 is powerful enough.	1

	everything you would want in a large sport luxury carsuggested improvements:ability to hold gears in manual mode (sport shift)	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlnice, but definitely doesn't comparei recently purchased a 4.6 genesis for my wife, and i'm not too impressed.	1
	an impulse buy really, but i'm beginning to see why the car is so much cheaper than my bmw.	1
	the engine is pretty nice, but in no way compares with my 550i's v8 (torque curve, etc).	1
	i'm pretty particular about my cars, and it's the little details with the genesis that turn me off.	1
	the materials just feel inferior, and it just seems like hyundai stole design features from all of their so- called 'competitors', down to the fake idrive and 5-series exterior styling cues.	1
	i think the buyers of this car will realize over time that this car is just a flashy attempt at producing a true luxury car w/o any substance.favorite features:ride similar to my wife's old lexus; sound sys.	1
	is better than any equivalent toyota.	1
	i can definitely see choosing this car over say an acura or lower end lexus, but just don't see how they say it competes with the german luxury makes or top- end lexus sedans.suggested improvements:market these cars against their true competitors, like the toyota avalon, camary, acuras, etc.	1
	this car is not in the same league as audi, bmw, mercedes, and lexus.	1
	simple fact: the car is made with cheaper components, therefore will cost less.	1
	interesting marketing ploy on hyundai's part though.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlgenesis is a winner!	1
	!i just passed 1200 miles and this car is a winner for hyundai.	1
	drives well in erie pa snow.	1
	there is a luxury about the genesis that 'drove' me to it.	1
	everything so far is excellent... as with all new model cars there maybe an issue or two that comes up.	1
	genesis provides the higher cost models (lexus/bmw/acura/mercedes, etc) a true run for the money.	1
	the 5 year btb is one of the key components for the purchase.	1
	hyundai's decision to extend the extra year was a thoughtful and calculated one.	1
	i agree with all previous comments from other owners.	1
	i did research for at least 6-9 months prior to purchase and i am glad i did.	1
	the service is key to post purchase and success to hyundai.favorite features:agree with all previous comments.	1
	as hyundai builds the 2010 genesis i am sure they will incorporate the features that most 2009 owners have strongly suggested.	1
	i am waiting for a direct call from either the regional or national hyundai office to discuss the issues for improvements.suggested improvements:again, i agree with previous comments.	1
	if there are ways to correct some of the discrepancies now for the 2009, ex: a coin tray to replace ash tray.	1
	that would be a benefit and shows response to the consumer/owner.	1
	i strongly suggest that dealerships do not place the front license plate on front.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlvery surprised...never thought i would ever buy a hyundai but i am truly satisfied.	1
	traded in my 540i which was breaking down for a much faster and smoother car.	1
	it doesn't handle like a bmw but still pretty nice.	1
	people tried to discourage me from getting a genesis and now they are the ones who are thinking about it after riding my car :)favorite features:375 hp, huge trunk space.suggested improvements:- all wheel drive model - touch screen navi - softer suspension	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlgreat car but....i have been a hyundai owner for about 5 years and have always been impressed with the quality of the cars for the money you spend.	1
	the genesis is absolutely no exception.	1
	i went in for an oil change on my old elantra, test drove the genesis, and got it that day.	1
	at least once a day i have someone comment on how much they love the look of the car.	1
	the solid performance rounds out a really great package.	1
	be careful though if you live in colder climates, the car is a real wheel drive which is great when it is nice out, and even in the rain but when it snows, the car struggles for traction (i spent 35 minutes today stuck on the side of a slightly inclined road while other cars passed)favorite features:the styling, ride, acceleration, and interior size (the trunk is tremendous and the back seats are very comfortable)suggested improvements:all wheel drive...the car handles horribly in the snow (especially from dead stops or on hills) and the stability control provides little help in those situations.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.10....htmlluxury car benchmarki am only 19 years of age but i know cars.	1
	my parents have leased several bmw's which i have driven.	1
	i decided to purchase the genesis because of all that you get for the money.	1
	the 4.8 genesis has 7 series luxury, 5 series performance, for a 3 series price.	1
	the pickup is better than the cadillac cts, bmw 3 and 5 series, mb c, e, and clk class, and lexus is, es, gs, and is even compared to the ls, 7 series, and s-class.	1
	this car will be remembered for years to come.	1
	a true collector's item an the age where collector cars have died out since the 1970's.	1
	i will definitely keep this car looking good and running well to keep value high.favorite features:rolls royce stereo (lexicon) suede leather seats nav, xm, backup camera, dvd playersuggested improvements:engine.	1
	there is nothing wrong with the 4.6 at all, but i would love to see a supercharged v8 or a v10 as used in the korean bread hyundai equus, which is american bound in late 2010 or early 2011.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.11....htmlgreat job, hyundaii've had my genesis for two weeks now and cannot say enough about this car.	1
	i also own a 2005 infiniti and the build quality on the genesis beats the infiniti hands down.	1
	the acceleration on the v8 is amazing.	1
	given the fairly similar fuel economy to the v6 and all the small extras you get with the 8, it's definitely worth the few extra bucks.	1
	i've driven an ls 430 several times and can say that this car knocks the lexus out of the ballpark.	1
	anyone who owns any of the major luxury brands and is in the market for a new ride should not discount this car simply because it's a hyundai -- and if they do, it's their loss.favorite features:remarkable acceleration, whisper quiet interior, decent balance between ride and handling; tech package is a must.	1
	ipod integration is a huge plus.suggested improvements:hyundai should consider having it's own dealer network for this car.	1
	if this is any indication of what hyundai can do from a luxury standpoint, a separate genesis division would surely be a home run for them.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.11....htmli can't take my eyes off her :-)i did a lot of research, checked out the competition (cadillac, infiniti, etc.)	1
	and the genesis out performs them by far.	1
	the fit and finish of this car is amazing.	1
	i find myself just stopping to admire her beautiful lines inside and out.	1
	everyone is surprised when you tell them its a hyundai.	1
	hyundai hit the nail on the head when developing this great luxury automobile.favorite features:lexicon 17 speaker system, nav system, loads of room, high quality leather interior (even on the doors), heated and cooled seats, comfort amenities galore, ton's of room, - the boys from detroit need to take note.	1
	too many favorites to mention.suggested improvements:make the korena market geneis wing logo standard on the car.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.11....htmli love this car!before i bought it i test drove infinity g35, m35 and acura tl.	1
	i even brought infinity m35 to hyundai dealership, parked both cars next to each other, opened all doors and trunk and almost compared each inch of the cars.	1
	i am waking up every morning and thinking: 'i will be driving genesis today again!'	1
	incredible car!.	1
	some previous reviewers seems like didn't read car manual.	1
	side mirrors reverse tilt down can be switched off, trunk has push button right above license plate (slightly to the right).favorite features:memory seats, backup camera, front and rear sensors,suggested improvements:	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.11....htmlyou'll be surprised !i have only just purchased this car, and i must tell you, it is fast.	1
	i have been driving an mb e500 and it is faster off the blocks and seems to have the same feeling that there is no end to how fast the car can go.	1
	it has all the high tech gadgets which are remarkably easy to operate especially by someone like me that eschews reading instructions and following complicated manuals.	1
	do not test drive the 4.6 unless you are prepared to buy this car when you return to the dealership.favorite features:premium leather seats, acceleration, quietness of highway ride, huge trunk, technology package and of course, the lexicon stereo.suggested improvements:sun visors should be more substantial and it would be nice to be able to remote start the car.	1

	the quietness on the freeway!	1
	the heated seats are awesome.	1
	the stereo is unbelievable!	1
	given the car is basically my office the huge trunk is a major plus!suggested improvements:darker tinted windows, an easier option to search songs on the ipod..using the dial starting at a to get to z is a bit ridiculous - it needs a quick search button or something.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.11....htmleven better than all the hype!never thought i'd buy a hyundai.	1
	but i gave up my bmw 3-series for the genesis, and i am extremely satisfied.	1
	far more luxury and better craftsmanship.	1
	the extra cost of the bmw is only for the slight handling edge on the track and for the bragging rights; i need neither.	1
	i put 3,000 miles on my genesis in just two weeks.	1
	every mile adds to the satisfaction.	1
	absolutely no complaints.	1
	if the genesis's reliability is closer to that of the modern-day sonata and azera rather than the '86 excel, that's all i'll need!	1
	had just spent 3 months in seoul, and was impressed with the koreans' fast- developing economy, technologies, and mentalities.	1

	as we age and not into status or snob appeal any longer value,reliability, warranty coverage, and styling are important.	1
	brand cachet was certainly not a consideration when we bought a 2006 sonata lx (loaded v6).	1

	superb gas mileage for a 235 hp v6 and plenty of good features.so when the genesis made it's debut in the lux arena we bought a white satin pearl 3.8 w/tech package as it came off of the truck.	1
	a year of due diligence in the form of technical research, auto magazine and critical reviews sold me on another hyundai.	1

	bmw, mb & lexus look out for the new kid on the block, hyundai hit a grand slam with this one.	1
	i also have an 06 lexus ls 430. this car is nicer in every way.	1
	looked at the new ls460 with all the toys and except for a few minor touches the genesis is a steal at 25k less.favorite features:technology package, ride,handling, fit and finish, awesome engine performancesuggested improvements:drivers seat extender, cooled passenger seat,power folding outside mirrors, underseat front storage drawers, bigger console storage, power trunk opener	1

	drive it.	1
	do the math.bought my hyundai 4.6 last week.	1
	my first impressions are this is a great car for the price.	1
	if you are reading this and are thinking of buying a bmw, lexus or mb you need to drive this car.	1
	traded our volvo s60 r for this car and i couldn't be happier.	1
	the steering is not as tight as a bmw or mb and the ride is softer but thats okay for my driving habits.	1
	i had a deal for a nicely optioned 2008 bmw 535i that fell through.when all was said and done we financed $17k less for a fully loaded genesis 4.6. more reviews to come as i get more acquainted with car, but at first impression this car is great value for the money.favorite features:value, comfort, ride, sound system, power, too much to list.suggested improvements:chrome rim option, wood package option.	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.13....htmlgood and badi have been impressed since the first ad i saw.	1
	visited the dealership just to see the interior and i was amazed with the fit and finish.	1
	bought a v6 with all the bells and whistles the next day.	1
	2 weeks, 500 miles later i was at the repair center because the stereo was wigging out.	1
	they replaced the $4k head unit which made no difference.	1
	now they are replacing the amp hoping that will fix it.	1
	the alignment has been pulling to the left since i bought it and they supposedly fixed that too.	1
	nope, still pulls left.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.13....htmlgenesis for a genesismy company name- genesis, so my wife kept suggesting that i buy... a genesis.	1
	for the fun of it, we did a test drive and fell in love.	1
	the dealership was sensitive to the upscale nature of the car and us being informed buyers.	1
	it has been big fun so far with the head turns (there are only 3-4 in tyler tx (our home) so far.	1
	and we are adding all of the 'wings' extras to personalize it from kai.	1
	the trim is the premium plus with the technology package.	1
	we wanted the v8, but.. they can't keep them on the lot!	1
	i was ok with the power of the v6, but missed some of the trim that is only available on the v8.	1
	but, we're adding most back in.	1
	love it!favorite features:for the first shot out- hyundai got so much right.	1
	i love the quiet ride at 90+mph (shhhh).	1
	attention to serious features.	1
	the sound system- wow!	1
	and i'm picky about sound in my car.suggested improvements:build in the ability to enhance the dis (driver info system) for a fee.	1

	-- in mid-july this year and have been extremely happy with it to date.	1

	on our first 1100 mile trip with mileage divided 80/20 between interstate and local/city, we averaged 29.4 mpg.	1
	the comfort level is beyond any other car we've owned.	1
	the engine is nearly silent and very strong -- it loafs at 75 mph on the interstate.	1
	would strongly recommend a test drive to anyone who is looking for a very high level of comfort, features, and performance.favorite features:power tilt & telescope steering wheel, 6-speed auto/manual shifter, rear window shade.suggested improvements:add cooled seats as an option to the lower package levels.	1

	eventually i made my way to the sticker and realized this model cost 6k less than other similarly styled cars.	1
	i arrived in a '07 altima se and drove home in the same genesis that afternoon.	1

	(with lexus, all i have to do is just pull & open the door) at low speed transmission is a bit jerky (heard this goes away after a month or so) steering is a bit difficult when parking or at low speed i like to have a coin box: not ashtray.	1

	two issues,,the speedometer reads about 10% fast.	1
	i hate doing math while i drive and i don't like knowing the odometer showing 10% more miles than actual, not to mention the gas mileage indication is also overstated.	1
	i also hear a faint 'knocking' sound at 1900 rpm just before shifting.	1
	seems to have changed somewhat after the recall reprogram.	1
	dealer has been unable to assist with either problem.	1
	anyone out there having similar issues?favorite features:love the size and ride of this car.	1
	i've owned plenty and this is excellent.suggested improvements:	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.14....htmlgreat ride for the road warriori was looking at maxima and cts and heard about the genesis---took a look, a drive and was sold.	1
	throttle is a bit sluggy off the line, but punch it a little and she zooms up to speed with very smooth shifting and great tracking- sound system is superior, hand free phone at hwy speed sounds great to callers, this is a great car and a great value- time will tell if the abundance of plastic parts will hold up and i noticed that the rear wheel wells are lined with some type of fibrous cladding- hope it holds up well to chicago winter- all in all, this has been a joy to drive, and i am constantly getting the thumbs up from other drivers- this car is becoming the hot ride of the season.favorite features:interior design, dash and cabin lights, leather wrapped everything, sound system, handling, braking and overall style- did i mention sound system??	1
	this baby rocks!	1
	hyundai badge is fine with me, this car announces that they have upped the game.suggested improvements:more interior cubby holes, deeper center console, fully fold down back seat, rain drip guides to keep water from drizzling into open trunk, a bit more thigh support for us tall guys would be great	1

	i'm riding in first class with a coach ticket.	1
	you can't beat that price.	1
	thanks hyundai for the genesis, i don't have to pay a mortgage payment for a ride in luxury.favorite features:techno package ,the paint job, and the quiet ride.suggested improvements:my suggestion isn't about the car per se but the marketing strategy.	1
	i think comparing the genesis to the lexus,benz,and bmw is stating that they are the benchmark.	1
	make the vehicle that consumers want and let hyundai's name sell for itself stop comparing and set a precedence yourself.	1
	it's time	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.14....htmlmakes a long commute a joythis is my first luxury vehicle, just coming out of a 96 maxima se.	1
	test drove the 2009 maxima, 2008 acura tl, and the genesis.	1
	the genesis outclassed them all, so i ended up buying a v6 w/tech package.	1
	the features on this car are an incredible value even though i still shudder when i think about how much higher my loan is on this car.	1
	great ride - kind of similar to my father's 2001 bmw 528i, but more smooth overall.	1
	definitely not as mushy as a lexus, but not as punishing as a beemer.	1
	great looking car, too - i've gotten a lot of rave reviews of the car's looks and disbelief when i tell them 'it's a hyundai.'	1
	all-around excellent car.favorite features:the stereo - beats the bose in my wife's murano hands down.	1
	truly extraordinary.suggested improvements:would like to see the cooled seats added for passenger (my wife is way envious).	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.14....htmlbest luxury sedan availablethe genesis is actually the best stereo you can buy that that delivers you to your destination in fine luxury and comfort.	1
	the balance between comfort and being close to sporty is outstanding.	1
	car & driver and road & track can gig the car for sportiness - not all of us like the taut, firm ride of the bmw's and audi's.	1
	the gas mileage is better than expected, especially cruising at 75. as mentioned by many, dealer support for a luxury car needs to be better.	1
	hyundai does stand by there warranty.	1
	our dealer gave us 2 years worth of oil changes and car washes, and has a very good reputation.	1
	i would advise finding a good dealer when buying.	1
	the value of this luxury car is outstanding.favorite features:stereo!	1
	stereo!	1
	and stereo!	1
	the ride is out of the world, and the backlit dash at night is out of this world.	1
	the warranty is outstanding, and the other luxury sedans can't compete in features and amenities for the price.	1
	and it fits my 6'4' frame, something that lacks in the bmw and mercedes.suggested improvements:back seat needs to be collapsible for complete pass thru.	1
	cool seats on both sides.	1
	much needed dealer training and support to get them into the mentality of how a luxury car should be delivered and give same aspect of value as bmw and others.	1
	overall, this is a grand ride, and hyundai has a hit.	1

	my first tank of gas averaged 27.4 mpg now that i like.	1
	of course it's not a v-8 but we have to give a little somewhere.favorite features:pros love the seats with a bad back can still drive for hours.	1
	the backup camera and parking sensors i really as i have new garage doors.suggested improvements:a 2009 car that has a gps that is so out of date.	1

	i am serious.	1
	i see no reason why they want to identify this as a hyundai.	1

	the leather wrapped dash, ac seats, sound system, adjusting headlights, i could go on and on.	1
	i personally have never owned a luxury car but most of my friends do, and they cannot believe the features this car offers for under 40k.	1
	it is unbelievable how many lexus, bmw and mb driver approach us, telling us how beautiful the car is and cannot believe it is a hyundai.	1
	i would recommend this car to anyone, and do.	1
	i am looking forward to what comes next with hyundai.favorite features:the push button start, ac seats, gps system, driver memory seats, the rain sensor wipers, 18' wheels, rear window sun screen, back up camera and the side mirrors turn down when backing up.suggested improvements:the material use for the headliner seems on the budget side, the rear seats do not fold down, the trunk is opened the water drips from the exterior into the trunk area.	1

	closest until price is compared.	1
	at about $10k less, it's the automotive bargain of the year, perhaps decade.	1
	like others i looked at and drove bmw, mb, audi, lexus, infiniti and others, all of which are a lot more money.	1
	believe me, none are quieter, more comfortable, more solid feeling, or handle better in every day traffic.	1

	they built a first ever rear wheel drive car that is quiet, has an incredible sound system and everything you would expect in a $60,000 car except that it cost 40. i realize that this is a first year model but as of now,hyundai hit it out of the parkfavorite features:to long to list, push button start, rear wheel drive, 6 speed, 8' nav, heated and cooled driver seat front and rear sensors and back up camera ( are you kidding) and the most incredible stereo i have ever heard.	1
	it does have some things that hyundai needs to address.	1

	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.16....htmlincredible value for $$$!moved from 2006 azera ltd to this.	1
	other cars currently owned are 2006 bmw 'm' roadster and 2008 infiniti m35.	1
	prior vehicles (since 1994) -- 1998 mercedes sl600, infinity q45(2), lexus es(300 & 330), a 2002 porsche turbo, and a vw phaeton.	1
	it is our experience that the 2009 genesis is absolutely the best value of any of the above cars - there is no comparison versus what hyundai packs into this vehicle for $40k when fully loaded.	1
	we could have chosen any car we wanted and yet opted for this because of our prior excellent experience with the azera and the fact that the genesis offers far more features and performance for much less money than any of the autos we have owned.favorite features:the fact that genesis has managed to pack in bluetooth, an ipod connector, a 6 cd changer and a nav system into the same vehicle which no other auto maker seems to have figured out how to do yet.	1
	either you get one or another but not all.	1
	in addition, lexus bluetooth is a known nightmare --suggested improvements:trunk on the azera is bigger and the azera's rear seats fold down to facilitate a large pass through.	1
	azera's rear seat room is also much more ample.	1
	but, when compared to lexus or our infiniti, the rear seat room easily beats them all.	1
	in net, about as good as it can get at any price!	1
	/hyundai/genesis/2009/consumerreview.16....htmlhyundai should be at the top of the listlike many others here, i too can't believe i even looked at hyundai, let alone getting one!	1
	i began researching this car early in the year.	1
	i was coming to lease end on a 2006 m45 sport and wanted something much less expensive, uses regular fuel and gets better gas mileage.	1
	i liked the handling dynamics of the m45 and was worried that i took a big step backwards in handling.	1

	i have found myself taking the same turns and curves in the hyundai that i did with the m45 - at the same speeds - and the hyundai is just as 'planted' as was the m45.	1
	obviously the m was quicker, but i enjoy everything about the hyundai better.favorite features:nice roomy interior, large trunk.	1

	when i did a little research on the models at the new york autoshow, i ran across this hot looking hyundai.	1
	when i examined the details i scratched my head and said wow !	1
	hyundai, might of just hit the jackpot.	1
	it sure looks great on paper                                so i think it's very important to start discussing one of the most important launches in automotive history.	1
	if this car is a winner, it could send shock waves around the globe.	1
	one could buy a lexus at toyota, prices has been quoted.	1
	i as a very loyal gm, fan love the design of this future great automobile.	1

	long time coming... i haven't posted here in a while, but it seems things have been pretty busy at hyundai.	1
	i, too, like the concept car genesis.	1
	it does resemble the toyota camry in a way, but it's more luxurious.	1
	i also like the front end of the new concept opened at seoul.	1
	i forgot what it was called, but it totally looks like the future of the tiburon.	1
	if the front end looks anything like it, i'm totally buying it!	1

	i as a gm, fan am terrified of this vehicle.	1
	i think toyota, is fearful also.	1
	a luxury vehicle with a powerful refined rwd v8 at toyota camry prices is something we could predict but always wonder when ?	1
	well it will be here in a few years and it will be interesting to see how the market reacts.	1
	will car prices have to drop ?	1
	can the manufactors using more expensive labor afford to drop msrp's ?	1
	hyundai, is using not only inexpensive south korean, labor but they also buying inexpensive parts to manufactor this vehicle.	1
	will it be 'toyota' like in the luxury department or will it have content that is also found on lexus class of vehicles ?	1
	if they can give it above average gadgetology aka creature features then this car will steal lots of sales from a lot of segments that want to upgrade without having to pay the high stickers !!!!!!	1

	yes bumpy, i am drooling over this hyuyndai.	1
	the veracruz looks to be about as nice.	1
	it's a poor mans lexus, and if i wasn't so prejudice about buying a foreign car i would line up for one (genesis) in the near future.	1
	anyway, the genesis is set to be the second coming of the ls400.	1

	the bh (the platform code) is already the size of a bmw 7-series, and there's an even larger version (vi) in the works.	1
	it's going to kick the snot out of all luxury cars in my estimation.	1
	i did not know the platform could stretch to those siszes.	1
	i still think hyundai, should offer the delphi magneride suspension as a option on the 'limited-ultimate'                                rocky       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/6#msg6re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [snakeweasel]        snakeweasel, if it's enough to get me to like it that pretty much tells you they have a hit.	1
	i'm pretty picky and conservative on my car choices.	1
	you won't see my driving a aztek, like vehicle ever.	1
	i like smooth lines.......                                rocky       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/7#msg7re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [rockylee]        rocky, i like this concept.	1
	but i don't think it will be anywhere close to camry in terms of msrp.	1
	as of now, sonata is not much cheaper than camry anyway.	1
	let's say, sonata is 5%~10% cheaper than camry.	1
	let genesis be 5%~10% cheaper than the v8 rwd toyota (ls460), subtract another 10% for not using an up-market brand name.	1
	that will still be at least $50,000 for the starting msrp.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/8#msg8re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [killerbunny]        what ?????	1
	did you not watch the video on this car ?	1
	it won't even hit $40,000.	1
	most estimates have a well loaded version 'limited' v8 being no higher than $35k                                the 'ultimate' genesis is only expected to be in the upper $30k range if it's even that high.	1
	the 2008' veracruz limited-ultimate package is the highest priced hyundai, ever with a $37 and change msrp.	1
	i don't expect the genesis, ultimate to be much if any more than that.	1
	so $50k isn't going to happen unless they make a 7-series/s-class competitor which as bumpy said could happen someday soon.	1
	rocky       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/9#msg9re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [rockylee]        in that case, the genesis won't be anywhere close to ls460 in terms of performance and quality.	1
	after double checking, hyundai is not a company owned by god himself.	1
	they cannot create a super luxury car out of thin air.	1
	the sonata, being a 5% better value than the camry, is already an achievement.	1
	the genesis will be the same, 5% better value than a car of same quality.	1
	after all, being a 5% better value is all you need to capture a market.	1
	that's how lexus beats the crap out the mb in north america.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/10#msg10re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [killerbunny]        like i said i can't make absolute factual comments on a car that isn't out yet but on paper i think it's realistic to say one will beable to own a cadillac sts/lexus 460/mercedes e-class/bmw 5 series, like mixture of vehicles for entry brand money.	1
	i don't know how you can justify saying that hyundai, won't have a very competitive offering ?	1
	one of their targets was the bmw 5 series in handling.	1
	i'm not saying this thing will carve up roads like a bimmer, but in should be able to equal what the infinti m45 is able to do which also had the 5-series as a target.	1
	you also are forgetting the difference in labor rates.	1
	the south koreans, aren't exactly making are wages levels thus they are able to keep those costs down helping them undercut the competition.	1
	they are essentially not going to make the margin of profit on having a luxury brand name but they will still make a good profit and give the customer one hell of a vehicle for his buck.	1
	i checked out the sonata vs. camry and it appears you are taking a loaded out sonata and comparing it to a base camry                a loaded out camry can touch well into the $30k range something a sonata, won't even come close to.	1
	rocky       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/11#msg11the veracruz is really the start but the genesis is going to change it all!	1
	hyundai is merely doing what lexus did 20 some years ago: offer a luxury car to battle the entrenched and over-priced marques at a budget price.	1
	hyundai is selling 90% of its azera's in the limited and ultimate package option which puts that at about $30k.. so this things could just fly and fly off the floors fast.	1
	naysayers are claiming 'noone is going to buy a luxury hyundai' because it doesn't have the prestige factor.	1
	and lexus had prestige when it arrived.'	1
	did in the 80's?	1
	no, it didn't.	1
	lexus invented and marketed themselves and the segment was redefined.	1
	remember the lexus add that changed it all.	1
	'from question mark to benchmark'                look, the market is totally ready for a newcomer to shake things up.	1
	hyundai is the cinderella story of the automotive world and we know people love those stories.	1
	check out what the  washington post said:                                'it is a threat to anyone making cars, economy or luxury.'	1
	'it(hyundai)can topple general motors.	1
	it can upset toyota.	1
	it already has bypassed nissan and honda in global vehicle sales.	1
	it is as determined as any company to rank no.	1
	1 on the world's automotive stage.'	1
	'consider the matter of engineering.	1
	the veracruz comes with an easy-breathing, 260-horsepower, 3.8-liter v-6.	1
	it uses regular unleaded fuel.	1
	the engine is linked to a remarkably smooth six-speed automatic transmission.	1
	the comparable rx350 comes with a 3.5-liter, 270-horsepower v-6 that requires premium unleaded fuel.	1
	that engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission.	1

	the elite marques don't even need to offer reliability or quality but just offer the perception and marketing of such.	1
	i recall a recent car and driver article which noted engine failure in several of their long-term tests of bmw's below 50,000 miles.	1
	people who buy a bmw don't care though because the perception of the marque is greater than the reality of its failures.	1
	hyundai has the opposite: the reality of their quality and durability is less than the perception of its previous failures and therefore prevents many customers from experiencing just how good recent hyundai's are.	1
	our family was loaded up with hyundai's at one time and had so few problems that we were shocked and amazed that people thought we were driving 'junk'.	1
	we were alomost evangelistic to try to tell others just how good they were.	1
	this is what many hyundai owners experience, partly due to low expectations, and why hyundais return customers % is  rapidly rising above other brands.       	1

	i read recently that hyundai is already planning on 5 liter variants of the 4.6 and direct injection and twin turbo applications that will make the genesis over 500hp from the  plant!	1
	not taking that serious?	1
	noone is taking the genesis as a serious contender to the bmw or lexus but neither did they take lexus serious either.	1
	by the way, for anyone who thinks this could not measure up, hyundai has already spent 5 years on the development of this and they know it has to meet or exceed expectations..that is why they keep changing and revising this thing.	1
	also, hyundai has the money to throw into this because its their 'halo' car that will catapault them to new heights of brand recognition and sales.	1
	this one car could change everything when it arrives.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/22#msg22re: where [paisan]        i don't think you read my context correctly.	1
	i'm interested because if it's built here, it will sell even better.	1
	if not built in us, if its content is parts built here, i.e., a motor, and assembled elsewhere, that's better for them.	1
	i don't know where hyundai has plants and builds what currently that might become genesis production plants.	1
	that's what i was asking.	1
	i didn't ask about clothing, tvs, shoes, etc, since that's off topic.	1
	as someone who shopped sonatas recently, i find this an interesting upscale for hyundai.	1
	the only item i really didn't like on the sonata was the lower profile, larger diameter tires.	1
	i want the old-fashioned 16-inch 60 profile or taller tires for what i consider a better ride.	1
	yes, i know i'm out-of-fashion on that one.	1
	other than that the sonata could get my dollar.	1
	the azera might even make it as a lesabre replacement.	1
	as toyota loudly advertises its us plants building cars, i believe the hyundai has an even better chance of giving honda/toyota a run if the car is built in us or has a good content.	1
	i am in favor of hyundai making a competitive car for competition with the cache the other two have built.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/23#msg23re: where [imidazol97]        sorry for that, i was verbally attacked by a ford representative yesterday at nyias as to the fact that i drive a nissan and that i'm hurting american workers etc and that ford is supporting them etc.	1
	it irritated me that she couldn't see the fact that i'm going to buy whatever is the best product for my money.	1
	hence the clothing reference because it's the same analogy of buying them from overseas due to the price/value being significantly higher than domestically produced goods.	1

	it is possible to come close, and even exceed, performance and quality for less money.	1
	cost does not always equate to performance and quality.	1

	i don't think hyundai needs the prestige factor, its going to battle it out on price.	1

	that is a fact and is the basis for competition.	1
	-i'm guessing                that lexus, acura and others will seek to offer an equivalent or better car for at least an equivalent price                                 -i know                that the consumer is going to be able to get more car for less money once hyundai seeks to enter this market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/30#msg30do you think....        do you all think hyundai will take an outfitted variant of the  veracruz, the i30 or velostar, azera, genesis concept and develop a luxury line out of them.	1
	hyundai has a number of concepts in the pipeline and has the production capability with new plants coming on-line to be able to put together a luxury bran with a new name.	1
	what do you think?	1
	imagine how much of a shake up it would be if hyundai showed up in 2008 with a 4 vehicle line-up that was $10-$25k cheaper than anything lexus or others offered.	1
	hyundai is really going after toyota/lexus so i would bet you would see a vehicle line-up to mimic that brand:                                lexus offering     hyundai offering                                is250/350          variant of i30, velostar comcept or c'eed                gs 350             azera variant w/new suspension;sh'tmetal                rx 350             veracruz variant                lexus ls 460       hyundai i70 (genesis concept)       	1

	lots of good posts.	1
	well i do guys think it's a good idea to try to buy american, but when ford, is building cars like they built my detroit lions team for the last 5 or 6 decades the consumers get tired.	1
	gm, has pushed the brand i love 'cadillac' to prices that people making my middle class wages can't afford them even if they save.	1
	ya know what imidazol97, that surprises me you were shopping a sonata.	1
	well the same can be said about me with looking at this genesis.	1
	i'm getting pissed that the big 3 are bringing a lot of their new cars from australia, or like the new saturns will be built in mexico, like the astra.	1
	perhaps maybe you and i should be like everyone else and say screw it and buy what's best for our wallet as cars are getting way to expensive even though they have cut production costs by more than 60% in the last decade to decade and a half with out sourcing.	1
	i do try to buy american made clothes, shoes, etc, but cars are going up faster than my raises.	1
	the genesis, will be on my radar when it comes out and so will the evo-x.	1
	the caddy sts will be out of reach cuz gm, hasn't ran any specials on the v8's as far as leases go.	1
	ford, at least does this time to time to move these expensive cars.	1
	my gm, discount will not eat enough lease cost to make one afordable.	1
	i can lease a navigator limited for the same money $150-$200 a month cheaper as an example than a sts and i will save $7k on a sts with my discount.	1
	i checked into it on a 05' when they came out.	1
	it was $780 a month with my gm, discount.	1
	i assume my 09' cts-v will run around $60k so that is out of the question probably also and knowing gm, i will have to wait months for them to offer gm employee elgible people a discount like they did when the first cts-v came out i was looking into.	1
	that's when i bought the 1 yr. old 02' seville sts.	1
	so just maybe a genesis, will fit the bill.	1
	we will see.	1
	i do like iluv's lancer, thus i will have to check out those evo's also.	1

	hyundai needs a new luxury division called genesis badly.	1
	current hyundai dealerships are still upset hyundai isn't making $8000 cars for their poor customers.	1
	they have no clue about how to sell a luxury car and their customers can't afford it.	1
	just the name hyundai is one of the worst, hard to pronounce, and offputting names for a company in the english language.	1
	hyundai owners are going to have to say 'hyundai' a lot in their daily life, many if not most people don't even know how to pronounce it and wouldn't want to if they could.	1
	and equus??	1
	genesis is an ideal name and isn't a made up cheesy word like acura, infiniti, or lexus.	1
	seriously, kia sounds cool but if i was hyundai i would consider changing the name of the whole brand just like datsun became nissan years ago.	1
	and tell whoever's planning on selling ssangyong cars from korea to stop smoking crack, one s might be doable but 2??	1
	hyundai dealers claim they can't even give away azeras now that hyundai stopped advertising it.	1
	nobody's going to want to buy a hyundai costing $35-40,000 with options.	1
	i know i wouldn't want it because of the hard to pronounce and unpleasant 'hyundai' name alone.	1
	instead of calling it the hyundai genesis, it should be the first car in a new luxury genesis division and be called simply the genesis m luxury performance sedan.	1
	the different engines would be distinguished as the genesis m 4.6 or genesis m 3.8. the number denoting engine size wouldn't be officially part of the name much like the audi a4 3.2 or 1.8 or whatever is still called just the a4.	1
	the genesis name would be centered between the taillights, 'm' would be above the left taillight, and 4.6 above the right taillight.	1
	a lot of people would consider buying an awd loaded genesis m 4.6 since it's basically an ls460 or next generation m45 for less than the price of an es350 or g35.	1
	reshape the m's camry-like grill and come up with daring designs in the future, hire some italians.	1
	future genesis models could include the s for a smallish sports sedan to compete against es350, g35, bmw 3, etc.	1
	an even smaller r sedan might not be necessary but could compete against the is250, bmw 3, audi a, etc.	1
	a large l sedan could compete against lexus 600hl, bmw 760il, mercedes s class, etc.	1
	g coupe and c convertible hardtop and maybe b hardtop roadster could appeal to sports luxury buyers.	1
	a genesis x crossover suv should be sold immediately alongside m as a rebadged and slightly restyled veracruz with additional luxury features like real wood trim, navigation system, etc.	1
	potentially a real offroading trucklike suv could be sold as a v class or they could use v as the name for the 2010 portico large minivan/suv.       	1

	this might force honda to redo the acura rl and come out with a v-8/10.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/46#msg46re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [killerbunny]         rocky, i like this concept.	1
	but i don't think it will be anywhere close to camry in terms of msrp.	1
	as of now, sonata is not much cheaper than camry anyway.	1
	let's say, sonata is 5%~10% cheaper than camry.	1
	let genesis be 5%~10% cheaper than the v8 rwd toyota (ls460), subtract another 10% for not using an up-market brand name.	1
	that will still be at least $50,000 for the starting msrp.	1
	1) it's not meant to compete with the camry.	1
	as noted, the sonata is.	1
	2) the bh (codename, no official name has been given yet) will likely start under $30k in the us, with the v8 version estimated at low-to-mid 30s range.	1
	3) feature-wise, what you see is what you get.	1
	i've been told everything listed in the pr would be available on the production model next year (e.g.	1
	nav, xenon).	1
	also, hyundai will likely become to first non-luxury nameplate to offer hd radio.	1
	4) good news for the power fans - the v8 will put out a lot more than 300 horses, hyundai has always estimated conservatively.	1
	upwards of 340 or more is possibly a slightly precise estimate.	1
	5) few changes in the front and the rear, otherwise, this is the car coming to the showroom next year.	1
	6) msrp and comparably speaking, the sonata is a good 10%-20% cheaper, depending on trims, packages and options.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/47#msg47i'm confused        if the genesis is supposed to start 'well under' $30k (v6 version), what happens to axera?	1
	is this azera's replacement?	1
	if the v6 genesis is in the high $20's, the v8 would be $5-7k more?	1
	around 33-35k?	1
	i don't have a problem with hyundai building a luxury marque.	1
	if they are meeting/exceeding sales goals for the former xg350/azera, then go for it.	1
	genesis is a better name for a company than a car.	1
	they will definitely need another vehicle to start a marque with.	1
	i'd build a coupe.	1
	personally, i'd get people comfortable with considering hyundai as a 1st-rate full-line marque, which most people haven't realized yet.	1
	i don't see what the rush is?	1
	but now might be the time to pounce!	1
	acura continues to struggle, and infiniti is working on a very slow upswing.	1
	lincoln is all but dead.	1
	audi isn't setting the world on fire, after countless opportunities.	1
	i think they're getting ahead of themselves, and should wait until the fall of 2010, at the earliest.	1
	and i agree, producing a couple of studly models for the naias, and announcing in the fall a new brand will emerge is definitely the way to do this, as lexus did.	1

	no i feel that hyundai is good for everyone involved in the auto industry.	1
	will the genesis be the end all?	1

	the point is just the car itself forces honda into rwd v-8 scene and for me that is a good thing.	1

	you cannot remain competitive in the auto industry by sitting still.	1
	the only segment where they try to compete is in huge suv's and full size truck segment.	1
	which is losing them market share and not really helping them at all.	1
	in the town where i live the amount of hyundai and kia's on the road is constantly increasing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/52#msg52re: i'm confused [drfill]        i really don't think hyundai is currently interested in building a new marque.	1
	hyundai is building a name for building a high quality, high content car for less and its working for them.	1
	i feel that they will continue with this strategy.	1
	building a new luxury marque will go against that strategy as one builds the name as a status symbol.	1

	the azera is hyundai's fwd flagship at the moment, but the genesis will bump it down a notch in the pecking order.	1
	the azera is slated to get the sonata 3.3l v6 as an option (the 3.8l v6 is the only current engine), which would put in solidly in the mid-$20s range, while the top-end azera would cost about as much as the base v6 genesis in the $28-29k neighborhood.       	1

	let me tell you that the azera is luxurious and has 'boulevard manners' and my sonata is like a frisky colt.	1
	my azera is competitive with the avalon and the lexus ls, and i have driven in both of those cars.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/78#msg78re: i'm confused [snakeweasel]        i disagree that hybrids are 'far more complicated' - at least toyotas - and even where they are different that is no basis to make the statement 'that means more likely to break down.'	1
	my toyota highlander hybrid is in many ways the same as the ice highlander - same v6 ice, most other components the same.	1
	differences include several electric vs engine mechanical systems (power steering, air conditioning, etc.	1
	), a cvt that has more than one drive component (the ice and an electric motor that doubles as a generator) - which is different but not necessarily more complicated than any other type of transmission, and the electric/battery parts of the hybrid systems which absolutely are unique.	1
	these may be different but that doesn't make them more complicated than their counterparts in non-hybrids.	1
	electric motors have been around as long as engines, and they are extremely reliable and very simple in their operation (their required control systems are also different but not necessarily more complicated either - and many components today are electronic rather than mechanical so again, different but not necessarily more complex).	1
	charge circuits and batteries likewise are different and unique, but not all that complicated.	1
	and most of the rest of the components on the highlander, at least, are the same as the non-hybrids.	1
	the really big difference is they are drive by wire, and managed by a computer to a greater extent than your standard ice vehicle (which today typically pretty computer controlled anyway), but i'd suggest this makes them more reliable, though a failure means they _might_ not be able to limp in for service.	1
	a well-designed, electronic system can be no more complicated (aside from the programming) than a mechanical system, but more precise and, especially compared to the mechanical cars of old, much more reliable.	1
	sure, technically the computer is doing lots of things when, for instance, it switches from power to charge to regenerative braking, but the actual execution of it is really pretty simple, different but no more complex than an automatic transmission shifting while the engine accelerates or when the brake pedal is pushed and the mechanical brake mechanisms using friction, hydraulics and other components along with the downshifting transmission slow the vehicle down.	1
	but there are ways they are less complicated.	1
	no serpentine belt, pulleys and other components to run the alternator (there is none), power steering, air conditioning.	1
	just electric motors.	1
	and those motors will probably last the life of the vehicle.	1
	ever lose a serpentine belt on the highway?	1
	sure, cheap to replace if one fails, but i'd suggest a well-designed collection of electric/electronic components is more reliable than the combination of similar components driven by that serpentine belt (i don't have statistics here to back this up, just a hunch based on experience with standard cars and reliability of electrical/electronic components).	1
	i'd really like to see statistics that back up the likely to break down statement.	1
	anecdotally, after almost 2 years of driving the highlander, and with friends who drive priuses and a new camry hybrid, my informal survey and personal experience says these are reliable, especially compared with my experiences in 35 years of driving any number of vehicles that were problematic.	1
	yes, there have been reports of failures, but there are failures in all products, some design flaws but more often individual problems.	1
	the only recall i'm aware of for the highlander had to do with an interior trim piece that could affect the accelerator - on hybrid and ice models.	1
	yes, the average driveway mechanic can't work on the hybrid components of hybrids, but with most vehicles being more and more computer controlled, you can't work on them, either, when it comes to the electronic components.	1
	but compared to the last 2 vehicles i've owned, i have a feeling the highlander hybrid will continue to be absolutely trouble free by 25000 miles while each of the last 2 had to have service for problems - and they were run of the mill vans that in the long run had significant failures in 'proven' systems that ended up costing significant $$ and, with the last one, would have cost thousands more had it not been we bought the hybrid.	1
	initial cost of the highlander was higher than the ice version, over the life of the vehicle our tco will probably be similar to the ice version, so overall it's a wash.  but we'll also have saved about 20% of the gasoline an ice version would have used, we will have polluted less, and our overall experience would have been similar with excellent reliability and comparable maintenance costs.	1
	check with me in 10 years/150k miles and we'll see if i'm right, but i suspect the reliability of the hybrid components will be better than had we had an equivalent ice vehicle, based on their being electronic rather than mechanical.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/80#msg80re: i'm confused [jdkahler]        i have no doubt that hybrids will be fine mechanically for 5/100k miles, but once they move beyond that, my feeling, no stats here, are that the batteries will start to hold less and less charge, meaning the 'hybrid' part of the car will start to do less and less work, thereby making it even less fuel efficient than a decent gasser.	1
	also since there is a small market for hybrids with all different components, you are looking at extremely high replacement costs on parts when the time comes to replace those parts that are unique to the hybrid portion.	1
	again these are all just my own opinion not based on any 'facts' or stats.	1
	to keep this on topic, i'd still like to see more diesels come over here, especially in a hyundai.	1
	-mike       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/81#msg81re: i'm confused [jdkahler]         i disagree that hybrids are 'far more complicated'                                you may disagree but the facts present a different view.	1
	with a hybrid you have two separate power sources working to power the same set of wheels either together or each on its own.	1
	it is impossible to do something like that without it being more complicated than one power source.	1
	it requires more moving parts, the ability to shut off and turn on power sources automatically.	1
	its far more complicated.	1
	a cvt that has more than one drive component (the ice and an electric motor that doubles as a generator) - which is different but not necessarily more complicated than any other type of transmission,                                while the transmission itself is not more complicated the linkage to the two power sources are.	1
	anecdotally, after almost 2 years of driving the highlander,                                2 years is nothing, get back to be in 10 years when you have 200k on the car and shelled out $5k on batteries alone.	1
	i suspect the reliability of the hybrid components will be better than had we had an equivalent ice vehicle, based on their being electronic rather than mechanical.	1
	but you see its not either ice or electrical it is both.	1
	when you combine the two it becomes far more complicated than either one combined.	1
	your typical drivetrain on a hybrid has more than twice the number of parts that a ice engine has.	1
	you cant sit here and tell me that it is not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/82#msg82my thoughts on the genesis        1. no way this car will be starting at 'well below' $30k like hyundai stated.	1
	i will make a prediction that a base v6 will have a msrp of $28,999 and top of the line v8 at around $40k.	1
	mark my words.	1
	even at these prices, if the genesis could live up to its hype it'll still be a great value.	1
	2. the v8 better has well more than 300hp, it should be at somewhere around 330 - 350hp range.	1
	the v6 will be adequet at around 270hp.	1
	3. although it's most graceful looking hyundai in its short history it is still a combination of rip-offs from other brands.	1
	headlights from acura, grill from nissan, front facial from lexus, side profile from infiniti, tail lights from aston martin and tail profile from bmw.	1
	however, there is nothing wrong with that since the first ls was a complete rip-off from mb s-class anyway.	1
	4. i would never buy this car since it's too big in size for my taste (mid-size is the largest i'll go, prefer something like 3er, is or g).	1
	however, would i recommend this car to my friends/relatives?	1
	you betcha.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/83#msg83your guarantees and hyundai's intentions        hyundai usa execs emphatically state that the genesis will not top out at $40k.	1
	they are stating it would defeat the very purpose to trying to gain a foothold in the luxury segment.	1
	let's face the fact that hyundai can put anything on the msrp sticker and then sell otd $5k less.	1
	so they can sell it for anything they want as they attempt to get the attention of those they are targetting.	1
	could we admit that the loaded azera, which sells nowhere near $30k is one of the bargains of the automotive world?	1
	the genesis will follow suit.	1
	i guarantee that.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/84#msg84re: your guarantees and hyundai's intentions [prosource1]        i drive the 'loaded' 06 azera and it is one of the best bargains i have ever owned.	1
	this in addition to giving excellent performance and offering superb quality.	1
	i find it a joy to own, and drive.	1
	i think the genesis will be similar in all aspects.	1
	my only question is will the hyundai dealers be prepared to sell such a car and how will they handle a car that is in an upper price range, at least for them?	1
	the dealerships have to be upgraded, in my opinion.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/85#msg85re: your guarantees and hyundai's intentions [drdonrs]        i read hyundai has been putting the hammer down on some poorly performed dealers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/86#msg86re: my thoughts on the genesis [louiswei]        if hyundai genesis arrives with what they promise and starts at $30k and v8 models well under $40k then, yes it                will be a great value.	1
	when lexus first came out, it was a true bargain compare                to bmw and mercedes.	1
	now depending on which model, i don't                think they are bargains anymore.	1
	it took many years to                establish themselves in that segment.	1
	for hyundai, it's probably not right time to create a                second brand like lexus or infiniti.	1
	it costs lots of                money and those costs have to be passed on to consumers.	1
	if genesis project is successful, someday they might have                a second luxury brand.	1
	in the near future, we might see some low-end cars from                china.	1
	it seems smart for hyundai to capture different                market than just low to middle segment.	1

	if it wasn't for lexus                or infiniti, other high-end brands would be charging more                or come up with lesser quality vehicles.        	1

	this genesis looks like its going to be the industry nightmare to all the other car makers!	1
	it's going to offer just about everything that mid to high vehicles such as lexus, bmw, m-b,  the like offer!	1
	especially the u.s. car makers, gm, ford,  chrysler; boy they better watch it!	1
	and one thing that i haven't seen mentioned here is the fact of hyundai's ever touted warranty of 10yrs.	1
	- 100k miles!	1
	something none of the other car makers ever make a claim to!	1
	those higher end cars never tout a warranty of that length!	1
	with those type of cars being built on  by the standard that they are, they should at the very least have that type of coverage offered from the gate, not as option to buy as most of them do.	1

	no way.	1
	this genesis looks like its going to be the industry nightmare to all the other car makers                                that's what they were saying about the ls400 back in 1990. mb looks to me are still doing pretty good these days.	1

	it's going to offer just about everything that mid to high vehicles such as lexus, bmw, m-b,  the like offer                                but with the hyundai badge...                                 hyundai's ever touted warranty of 10yrs.	1
	- 100k miles!	1
	something none of the other car makers ever make a claim to                                that's the case for sonata vs. accord/camry/altima as well.	1
	but last i checked, the camcords are still the segment leaders in sales (camry) and comparo (accord).	1
	those higher end cars never tout a warranty of that length                                because they don't need such a warranty to sell.       	1

	[louiswei]        your ever so right on your comments.	1
	i have an accord, 98'  i've had one previous, so i know what you mean.	1
	but, i feel even though t/h/n make very reliable cars, a warranty of that nature wouldn't hurt as i know you can get 300k miles easily from them.	1
	its just peace of mind.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/104#msg104us-korean free trade agreement        speaking of the global economy and the world getting smaller: here's something that just became effective (in the works for about a year but now apparently 'final'):                                04/02/2007                                washington dc  the united states and the republic of korea yesterday, april 1, successfully concluded a free trade agreement that will create economic opportunities for their people and enhance their economic and strategic partnership.	1
	this is a historic moment for our two countries.	1
	the united states-korea free trade agreement (korus fta) will provide u.s. farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service providers exciting new market opportunities in a growing, dynamic country.	1
	it will contribute to koreas successful transformation to a 21st century economic power,' said u.s. trade representative susan c. schwab.	1
	(for the 'average joe', you got to sell it first as a good thing for the us)....                                historically, korea has been one of the most protected agricultural markets in the world.	1
	the korus fta will create highly valuable new export opportunities for american farmers and ranchers by eliminating and phasing out tariffs and quotas on a broad range of products.	1
	under the agreement, over $1 billion worth of u.s. farm exports to korea will become duty-free immediately.	1
	most remaining tariffs and quotas will be phased out over the first ten years the agreement is in force.	1
	(note the phase-out of most over the first ten years)                                the korus fta will eliminate discrimination in engine displacement-based taxes, long a significant impediment to market access in korea.	1
	the agreement contains strong commitments to addresses the specific standards-related concerns raised by u.s. auto manufacturers ....                                (good for the us car manufacturers)                                industrial goods and consumer products                                nearly 95% of                 bilateral                trade in consumer and industrial products becomes duty-free within three years of entry into force of the agreement, with most remaining tariffs eliminated within 10 years                                (i think there is a 2.5 percent duty on korean cars being imported into the us, so that should go away... coincidentally there is a 40 percent duty on us beef going into korea.	1

	[chiefload]        how about renaming the entire hyundai brand 'genesis'?	1
	the genesis sonata and genesis azera could be differentiated from the 'luxury' branch of the genesis brand by giving simple letter names like genesis m luxury sedan to the proposed hyundai genesis.	1
	maybe there should be a genesis luxury brand, and kia could become the name for both the hyundai and kia brands and all their cars.	1
	would that work, i don't know much about the cheap cars both brands make.	1
	i'm guessing not, since kia probably makes similar cars to hyundai just slightly cheaper.	1
	in addition to midsize m, genesis luxury cars could include s small sedan to compete primarily with the great new g35 (genesis/hyundai and everyone else needs to look at the new g35 dashboard center console to learn about ergonomics and elegant design), l large sedan competing with s550/ls600hl/760il, g coupe, c convertible competing with c70/335ci, x for a more lux version of veracruz crossover suv competing with rx350/mdx/srx, and possibly r very small is/a4 type sedan, f small coupe, b roadster competing with z4/clk, v or y for offroading suv or portico minivan/suv, etc.	1
	anything short of creating a separate luxury brand probably wouldn't work, luxury buyers have an ego, all over the world, they demand a pure luxury brand.	1
	that's partly why acura with their cheap front wheel drive cars doesn't do so well in sales or with auto reviewers or with brand prestige, and the rl bombed.	1
	genesis luxury cars should stay away from fwd like the widely hated es350 and tl or rsx, and concentrate on rwd and i would suggest awd available across the entire line like audi (or infiniti?)	1
	to distinguish themselves as the asian audi only with better quality like the korean lexus and unbeatable value.	1
	the best thing would be to create a separate luxury genesis brand, it worked for toyota/lexus, and hyundai is trying to copy and beat toyota/lexus in everything it does.	1
	there's a huge difference between lexus dealerships which supposedly pamper and have the best customer service in the industry and toyota dealerships which just try to sell high volume and can be pushy.	1
	hyundai is the furthest thing on earth from a luxury brand and hyundai luxury cars will never be accepted or sell, isn't that obvious?	1
	i'm frankly stunned that hyundai is considering let alone planning on selling such a world class luxury car to compete with lexus' top of the line ls460 as a hyundai.	1
	that would be a disaster talked about in business schools for decades.	1
	are they crazy, do they know nothing about luxury customers?	1
	genesis/hyundai/kia should be like lexus/toyota/scion or lincoln/mercury/ford.	1
	except maybe change the hyundai name to something completely original and cool sounding, any ideas?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/112#msg112re: genesis: hyundai's new luxury division; change hyundai name?	1

	it's much pleasure to read your great posts and see how enthusiastic all of you are about the car.	1

	in korea, the car's usually referred to as the new dynasty, which is a step down from the flagship car equss.	1
	i drive santa fe (2004, diesel vgt model, 2.0).	1
	if hyundai follows snakeweasel's idea to name their luxury division genesis, not only they can use each book of the bibiel, but they could also use people's name too!	1
	like delilah for instance!	1
	absalom, nebuchadnezzar, and so on.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/113#msg113re: genesis: hyundai's new luxury division; change hyundai name?	1
	[nycdc911]        hyundai has been following the toyota/lexus playbook during its rise in quality and respect, why stop now?	1
	the biggest success toyota had was when they created a brand new lexus brand with the v8 ls400 in 89, which cost $35,000 or about $15-20,000 less than the competition.	1
	the genesis m starting a new luxury division would be the same thing and it would work for hyundai just like it worked for toyota/lexus.	1
	with rwd and awd, hyundai is aiming to top bmw's 5 series in handling and refinement so auto journalists should love it like they loved the ls400, maybe even more.	1
	a genesis brand would revolutionize the auto industry like lexus did, and could eventually rise to the top, at least among asian luxury brands.	1
	if they still decide to call this a hyundai genesis, where do they go from there with a future luxury division?	1
	with a 4.6l v8 and 197 inches long, it's the exact length and engine size as new lexus flagship ls460, supposedly interior room will be even bigger.	1
	ls460 has 380 hp and costs $60,000+.	1
	so would hyundai's first luxury division car have a 400-500 hp engine and cost $50,000?	1
	that should be the top of the line genesis luxury line model fighting the 7 series, s class, and ls l.  some people say hyundai should test the waters with a hyundai veracruz and genesis then come out with a luxury division with the second generation of those models.	1
	but why would luxury buyers who already turn their noses up at hyundai or even acura want to buy a rebadged second generation hyundai?	1
	i don't think hyundai can start a luxury brand with a car that's worse than a top of the line hyundai, wouldn't make sense.	1
	and this car is so good the only way to top it is with a car too expensive for their target market to buy.	1
	i'm planning on buying a loaded 08 infiniti g35x in about a year for msrp $41,000 negotiated to $38,000.	1
	if hyundai decides to start a luxury brand i'd consider a loaded awd v8 genesis m sedan just for the value and to be one of the first to get in on the brand even though i don't need a car that big.	1
	however there's no way i'm moving from my old lexus es300 to a hyundai genesis no matter how good it is or what kind of bang for the buck it has.	1
	shallow?	1
	maybe, but that's just the way luxury car buyers are, even at the entry level.	1
	do you think even one bmw 3 series buyer would consider any hyundai?	1
	hyundai is no infiniti let alone bmw or lexus, and it never will be and shouldn't try to be.	1
	they'll sell less than half as many cars if they call this a hyundai instead of starting a genesis luxury brand.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/114#msg114re: genesis: hyundai's new luxury division; change hyundai name?	1
	[nycdc911]        agree that hyundai should create a luxury brand.	1
	as matter of fact i think the production genesis should debut with the announcement of the luxury brand.	1
	the name genesis for the brand sounds a little bit cheesy but it's better than nothing.	1
	to start a new luxury brand hyundai needs 2 more models to go along with the genesis, which can be easily accomplished by hyundai today.	1
	here's the initial lineup i have in mind for it:                                entry level sedan: rwd, v6, around 280hp, about the size of a 3-series, sharing platform with genesis.	1
	starting msrp: $25k                mid size sedan: the genesis.	1
	starting msrp: $34k                mid size suv: take veracruz out of hyundai, load it up and plug it in here.	1
	starting msrp: $30k                                as one can see, 2 of the 3 models are already in place and the only work to be done here is to design the sheetmetal, interior and modify genesis' platform for its baby brother.	1
	genesis luxury cars should stay away from fwd like the widely hated es350 and tl or rsx,                                agree that the hyundai luxury division should be all rwd but neither the es350 and tl are 'widely hated' like you stated.	1
	as matter of fact, both of them are the best sellers for lexus and acura.	1
	asian audi                                i think acura is trying to become the asian audi by implementing sh-awd to all models in its lineup.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/115#msg115re: genesis: hyundai's new luxury division; change hyundai name?	1
	[louiswei]        wouldn't hyundai need to decide soon about starting a luxury brand since they'd need to build or convert new dealerships, hire and train staff, etc., before the launch of the genesis in late 2008?	1
	the genesis luxury brand could start with just 2 cars, that's how acura (legend sedan and integra coupe), lexus (ls400 and es250 which was a rebadged camry), and infiniti (q45 and a shortlived coupe) started.	1
	especially if those 2 cars are as diverse as a genesis m luxury sedan with either 3.8 or 4.6 liter engine, plus a rebadged and upgraded veracruz suv with real wood, navigation system, hard drive, etc.	1
	think about it, nobody was going to buy both the ls400 and es250 sedans back in 89, but people might actually go in and buy both the genesis m sedan and x suv within a short period of time.	1
	both the rebadged genesis and veracruz could be ready for the planned launch in the last half of 2008.                                i didn't mean the es350, tl, and rsx don't sell, but auto journalists hate fwd and a lot of luxury purists think they cheapen the brand as a fancy camry or accord.	1
	rwd cars with awd options on every car should satisfy everyone, and get the positive reviews that would be critical for the success of the new genesis luxury brand.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/116#msg116so...........        some think hyundai, couldn't emerge into a major player in the luxury field.	1

	i think it's a waste of money to spend the extra money for a emblem when i'd rather have the better product for less.	1
	hyundai, will find lots of buyers for it's cars as i still think their is huge market for people looking for a lexus, but can't afford or don't want to spend there hard earned cash just to have a emblem.	1
	hyundai, imho could be the biggest automobile company in the world by 2025, if not a lot sooner                 if                they can maintain this trend.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/120#msg120re: so........... [rockylee]        i agree with what you say here.	1
	hyundai has built a name of providing a lot for much less.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/121#msg121re: genesis: hyundai's new luxury division; change hyundai name?	1
	[nycdc911]        you are right.	1
	you likely will not be able to bring many present bmw, mb, lexus owners to take a hyundai, regardless of whether it comes with the hyundai badge or a hyundai-assocaited badge, as their next luxury car.	1
	but... you have a big group out there that is now and in the future upgrading from middle of the road type cars to entry level luxury to eventually full luxury vehicles.	1
	some of them will got for the old brands, some undoubtedly will (with hyundai having a good track record) be 'sensible' and go with what they consider to be best bang for the buck.	1
	i'm due to replace my current car with another set of wheels.	1
	i'm looking at the azera and various other mid-size cars, just below 30,000. i could see myself though driving the present car another year, just to wait for the genesis.	1
	that would then be my entry into the luxury class.... and i don't think i would be the only one who sees himself entering the luxury class via a hyundai/whatever badge.	1
	there is some question in my mind why i would shell out 10 - 15,000 extra for the 'brand'... no doubt that lexus and infinity produces extraordinary cars with very good reliability.	1
	but is it worth to me personally to spend that extra money...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/122#msg122the name hyundai has a poor image        i come from an extended family of lexus, bmw and acura owners.	1
	they would not be caught dead owning a hyundai.	1
	some have serious 'image' concerns.	1
	can you see an attorney driving clients around in a hyundai?	1
	no way.	1
	they all love my azera and when we have gatherings or dinner appointments, they always choose my azera over their higher priced cars (well .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	maybe they just want me to drive).	1
	anyway, they have nothing but praise for my hyundai azera.	1
	however, the 'image' of that car company steers them away.	1
	i think it would be a mistake to keep the hyundai name for their luxury line.	1
	they need to break off.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/123#msg123luxury brand        while i would like to see hyundai's luxury brand, i can see why in near-term hyundai vehicles continue to be badged under the hyundai nameplate.	1
	despite the past baggage (which is quickly disposed), it is still more recognized than a new brand.	1
	regardless, you have to start somewhere to build equity, timing, however, is critical.	1
	there are other issues such as dealer network which need to sorted and worked out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/124#msg124re: so........... [rockylee]        i disagree.	1
	i just don't see kia with that kind of brand clout for many years.	1
	when shopping for my new azera, i looked at a dozen or so cars from most manufacturers - altima and maxima from nissan, camry and avalon from toyota, accord from honda, sonata and azera from hyundai, and some of the luxury entry levels - acura tl, infinity g35, volvo s60, and lexus es and is.	1
	never once did i ever consider the amanti or optima.	1
	if hyundai is going to do the luxury brand, it's gonna have to be under a new nameplate.	1

	i think hyundai is trying to promote the same more for less that they have been in the past.	1
	imho hyundais target market with the genesis is not the lexus, mb and bmw buyer but the avalon buyer who wants more but will not or cannot shell out the money to buy a lexus, mb or bmw.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/132#msg132re: hyundai image [floridabob1]        i absolutely don't see hyundai going ubber luxury.	1
	i see them more taking on the middle class and upper middle class demographic that wants a 'luxury' car but doesn't have the means to pay for the 'luxury' brands such as lexus, acura, mb, bmw, caddy and don't really care about the 'service' provided by those brands such as the free loaners, and the doting over the customer that we see from those high-end brands.	1
	essentially they want something luxury and a middle of the road price.	1
	this is where i think hyundai can shine and really make themselves into the only player in a niche market.	1
	i know myself not having enough loot to buy into the 'luxury' class of vehicle would jump on something like this in a heartbeat.	1
	i don't need to have the sales guys or the service guys give me a latte when i bring it in for service, nor do i need a loaner car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/133#msg133genesis luxury division        rockylee, you seriously see hyundai 'beoming a lexus like brand with hyundai like prices'?	1
	what are you smoking??	1
	hyundai makes the cheapest cars in the world along with kia and still has a bad reputation among the vast majority of people, and you think they're going to be the absolute pinnacle of luxury like lexus?	1
	when people think lexus the company or even lexus the word, it is the very definition of luxury, because toyota planned it that way from the start, as a luxury only brand.	1
	you say you 'think it's a waste of money to spend the extra money for a emblem when i'd rather have the better product for less'.	1
	what extra money?	1
	hyundai will charge $29-40,000 for the upcoming genesis sedan whether it's a hyundai or a new luxury division car with a name like genesis m.                                the only difference is a new luxury division will appeal to both luxury car owners as well as economy car owners looking to move up, while keeping it a hyundai will only appeal to economy car owners.	1
	even the economy car owners would rather have a genesis luxury brand car for the same price compared to having the same car called a hyundai.	1
	so really, hyundai/genesis could sell 4 times as many of these cars if they created a luxury brand.	1
	so the downside of calling it a hyundai is huge, and there is no downside to creating a new luxury division which hyundai is definitely going to do anyway.	1
	it wouldn't make sense to make a car this good and not make it part of the inevitable luxury division.	1
	calling it a hyundai would lose a lot of money and sales and market share.	1
	would anybody here who currently drives a luxury car buy a hyundai instead of another luxury brand car?	1
	i know i wouldn't because the new g35x is an almost perfect car.	1
	well the number of luxury car owners even looking at this thread is a tiny fraction of the total number of luxury car owners, and most of them wouldn't even think of considering a hyundai.	1
	think of the 95% of the rest of luxury car buyers, a genesis luxury car company could sell to them just like lexus does.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/134#msg134re: so........... [burneedog]        i never said it was going to be a over night thing.	1
	i'm looking will into the next decade.	1
	toyota, nor honda, had the clout when they came to the states.	1
	they won customers by under cutting the compeitition.	1
	they gave you a lot more car for a lot less money.	1
	they presently feel they can charge whatever they want and get customers still.	1
	i think there is a bunch of people in this world who could care less about a emblem.	1
	they want the best damn car for their buck.	1
	that's how the millionaire next door made his money.	1
	he wanted luxury but wasn't going to spend his hard earn cash on mark-ups.	1
	it would be like throwing good money down a drain.	1
	if hyundai, can continue to build better kia's to match toyota's offerings at a cheaper price and if hyundai, can build lexus, like vehicles at toyota, prices you will see success in the long-term in my estimation.	1
	rocky       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/135#msg135re: genesis luxury division [nycdc911]        you are smoking something believing that by creating a seperate luxury brand which btw will cost perhaps in the billions to do is going to get luxury car buyers out of there lexus's, acura's, mercedes, cadillac's.	1
	i suppose a small fraction would look at the genesis luxury brand or whatever you want to call it if it was expensive enough.	1
	i think by creating a seperate luxury brand would be a huge mistake at this point.	1
	they do not need three brands.	1
	so you aresaying eliminate kia, and call them hyundai, and have hyundai/genesis as the two brands.	1
	kia, sells a lot of inexpensive automobiles and makes a good profit doing it.	1
	i think kia, can build themselves up and also offer nicer cars that will go head to head against camcords.	1
	hyundai, can get away with moving slightly up market but still remain inexpensive to under cut the competition.	1
	i respect you perspective but i feel right now and in the near future this isn't the time to make a seperate brand.	1

	you'd be laughed out of every business school in the country if you said something like that, lexus has been a tremendous success.	1
	just because you personally would like a $40,000 hyundai doesn't mean anybody else would.	1
	you don't drive a luxury car do you?	1
	nobody who drives a luxury car would consider a hyundai.	1
	while both luxury car drivers and economy car drivers would consider a new luxury division genesis car and even the economy car drivers would prefer that it be called a genesis luxury division car instead of a hyundai.	1
	i never said get rid of kia, what does that have to do with starting a luxury division?	1
	kia sounds much cooler than hyundai, and having 3 divisions genesis/hyundai/kia is fine like lexus/toyota/scion or lincoln/mercury/ford.	1
	i think you may be looking 15 years into the future and thinking of your wallet instead of hyundai's profits.	1
	when toyota first started lexus, the original ls400 undercut the competition by $15-20,000 and still was considered a superior product by many.	1
	nowadays a lexus is just as expensive, the ls 600 hl will start at $104,000.	1
	so i think rockylee fears that if a new genesis luxury division gets as much praise and sales as everyone knows it will, then it will follow the path of lexus and prices will go up to the point that he won't be able to afford them anymore.	1
	well too bad.	1
	hyundai/genesis is trying to make money, not save you money.	1
	that's the way corporations work, they want to make the most money possible, and starting a new luxury division will do that, obviously.	1
	calling it a hyundai would lose a lot of money, sales, and market share, nobody can deny that.       	1

	you'd be laughed out of every business school in the country if you said something like that, lexus has been a tremendous success.	1
	i never said that.	1
	toyota, has been very successful starting up lexus, and at one time the lexus, brand under cut cadillac, mercedes, bmw, but when the brand first started not all of them were great cars.	1
	what was the first camry clone lexus, made ?	1
	it was a camry with a lexus emblem on it.	1
	at least today they look a lot more different even if the lexus, model is a rebadge toyota.	1
	i think hyundai, can be a lexus brand with careful planning.	1
	yes it will take time and money to get the appeal but the most important thing is for hyundai, is to not go head to head with lexus, mercedes, bmw, cadillac, in pricing themselves high.	1
	i think if they can keep the blue- collar lexus image going they will win a lot of buyers because like paisan, said we middle-upper middle class want the luxury but don't have the loot.	1
	just because you personally would like a $40,000 hyundai doesn't mean anybody else would.	1
	you don't drive a luxury car do you?	1
	let's see i've owned 2 cadillac's and 1 acura tl, but currently no i don't own a luxury car but more than likely my next car will be a luxury performance car.	1
	nobody who drives a luxury car would consider a hyundai.	1
	well i disagree because some would rather save there money than waste it on a emblem.	1
	rich people who worked for there money didn't get it by being wasteful.	1
	i also don't think hyundai, is after those buyers anyways as i'd be willing to bet 80% of there sales come from blue collar americans that want to reward themselves with a affordable luxury vehicle.	1
	while both luxury car drivers and economy car drivers would consider a new luxury division genesis car and even the economy car drivers would prefer that it be called a genesis luxury division car instead of a hyundai.	1
	i honestly could care less.	1
	i don't need a emblem to judge a car whether it's worthy or not.	1
	i will judge the product not the name.	1
	only a fool will spend more to get less or the same imho !!!!!	1
	i never said get rid of kia, what does that have to do with starting a luxury division?	1
	kia sounds much cooler than hyundai, and having 3 divisions genesis/hyundai/kia is fine like lexus/toyota/scion or lincoln/mercury/ford.	1
	scion, is on life support.	1
	i've only seen two scion's since the brand has came out.	1
	it might be successful on the coasts but they are a rare find in the midwest and southern states.	1
	lincoln ford, mercury, isn't a sucess.	1
	mercury, ford, and lincoln, have to many rebadges.	1
	ford, has thought about killing off mercury for years as the brand is too much like ford.	1
	lincoln, has the mkz, which is a milan, with a upscale interior.	1
	you gotta be kidding me.	1
	i think you may be looking 15 years into the future and thinking of your wallet instead of hyundai's profits.	1
	when toyota first started lexus, the original ls400 undercut the competition by $15-20,000 and still was considered a superior product by many.	1
	it took them 5 years before they starting showing signs of being successful.	1
	the original ls 400 was a disaster with problems.	1
	sure now it's a icon in the luxury field but it wasn't all good at the beginning.	1
	they did gain sales by under cutting the competition like you said but now they have moved so far up market that young kids buying toyota's are more than likely will never own a lexus ls.	1
	they would have to settle for a rebadged camry in the es 350, or a rebadged highlander in the rx 330, and the is, is so small only the 'little people' from the 'wizard of oz' can drive them.	1
	nowadays a lexus is just as expensive, the ls 600 hl will start at $104,000.	1
	so i think rockylee fears that if a new genesis luxury division gets as much praise and sales as everyone knows it will, then it will follow the path of lexus and prices will go up to the point that he won't be able to afford them anymore.	1
	that is somewhat true but then i can afford a cadillac, sts.	1
	my point is then another luxury brand will come along and replace hyundai.	1
	i think the luxury brand field is to crowded as it is now let alone place another one in the market.	1
	i feel there is a place for a niche brand like hyundai, to be the working mans cadillac.	1
	i do think over time if hyundai, stays in this segment of being that you will see some price cuts from the top.	1
	if hyundai, builds a 500 hp bmw m5 genesis, for lets say $49,000 why would any one in there right mind go waste $30-40k to own a m5, unless you have so much money you don't care.	1
	well too bad.	1
	to bad for who ?	1
	i have not seen hyundai, annouce they are going to have a luxury emblem to satisfy your insecurity.	1
	what you think if you buy a hyundai genesis, you won't be invited to the cocktail party's ?	1
	i personally don't want to associate myself with people that are that arrogant.	1
	i like down to earth folks.	1
	hyundai/genesis is trying to make money, not save you money.	1
	they will make money by saving me money.	1
	if they overcharge like the other luxury emblems why would i bother buying a genesis, when i can buy a lexus for the same money ?	1
	lexus, has a reputation for superb customer service and i could get a latte in the service department while i wait.	1
	see where i'm getting at ?	1
	probably not !	1
	that's the way corporations work, they want to make the most money possible, and starting a new luxury division will do that, obviously.	1
	calling it a hyundai would lose a lot of money, sales, and market share, nobody can deny that.	1
	i think your proposal would be a disaster, thus i'm denying it.	1
	i think as hyundai, management said they want to make the genesis, as the millionaire next door will buy.	1
	they don't want to charge you a obscene price for a emblem.	1
	if hyundai, sticks to this philosophy, they could easily be one of the automotive giants by 2015. i mean be in the top 3 is sales volume.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/147#msg147re: so........... [rockylee]        these posts are getting too long.	1
	the main point is, a genesis luxury division would appeal to both the luxury car owners, and the economy car owners looking to move up, let's say there's 15,000 of each of those 2 groups that would buy a genesis m luxury division sedan.	1
	a hyundai would only appeal to economy car owners and some of those 15,000 economy owners that would have opted for a luxury division genesis won't want a hyundai because they want to move up from a toyota to an infiniti or lexus, not move down to a hyundai no matter how good it is.	1
	so with a luxury genesis division, 30,000 of these cars are sold.	1
	calling it a hyundai, 10,000 are sold.	1
	the genesis is much better than anything acura or infiniti sells and is the equal of lexus' 380 hp flagship ls460 in length and engine size and plans to be roomier and sportier.	1
	hyundai plans on eventually starting a luxury brand, well if they don't start one with this $40,000 car, what the heck are they going to start it with??	1
	a $50,000 car with 500 hp??	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/152#msg152luxury is not a bad word        i think one of the main benefits of hyundai creating a 'luxury' division/brand would be more about having a new factory dedicated to producing these cars rather than making all the cars at the same factory.	1
	i think you would get a higher quality car with that type of production facility.	1
	luxury cars are not just about name plates and prestige, most people are not millionaires or status seekers, they want to buy the best car they can for the amount of money they can afford to spend.	1
	if you can afford to pay 40-50k for a car you want to feel like that money is being spent on a car that is appreciably better than a car that costs 30-35k.	1
	at least that is how i think.	1
	i don't care if someone says, look he's driving a lexus, i care about knowing that i bought a quality car that will hold its value and perform the way i expect it too.	1
	i also want to get the best deal i can and, yes, if i can get a car with equivalent quality/amenities for less money i always will.	1
	for a lot of people, resale value is important and cars with higher quality, or most likely higher perceived quality, have higher resale value.	1
	a 40k hyundai is still a hyundai and in 3-5 years when i go to trade it in it will not have the same value as a lexus regardless of the actual quality of the car.	1
	just remember whatever you save on the front end you end up losing on the back end when you trade it in.	1
	unless you plan on keeping the car for 10 years or more.	1
	in which, case god bless you and best of luck with your extended warranties and repairs.	1
	for these reasons, i don't think creating a luxury division is a foolish thing to do, and does not detract from the buying experience.	1
	you can always feel good about paying 20k less for a luxury hyundai (whatever name they choose) than you would have for the equivalent lexus.	1
	plus, you can feel a little better knowing that car was produced at a state of the art facility with more skilled workers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/153#msg153re: luxury is not a bad word [docrw]        are the nissans and infinitis produced at the same plants?	1

	-mike       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/154#msg154the bottom line is...        if hyundai intends to make genesis a luxury sedan then they'll need a luxury brand.	1
	if it is only going to be a full size rwd performance sedan (like the 300 and upcoming g8) then they don't.	1
	luxury cars won't sell with a mainstream badge and vw learned that lesson the hard way with the phaeton.	1
	there is no 'blue-collar' luxury or 'blue-blood' luxury, the only luxury existing in the auto industry is 'luxury brands' and spin it all you want, hyundai ain't anywhere close of being one.	1
	heck, some people still having the perception that hyundai isn't on par with toyota/camry/nissan and we all know that none of those 3 are 'luxury brands'.	1
	just ask yourself:                                would you pay $50 for a steak dinner at macdonald's?	1

	i think the answer is very obvious...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/155#msg155re: the bottom line is... [louiswei]        i would however pay $35k for a rwd v8 300hp+ full size luxury car from hyundai, without the latte and white-glove service.	1
	i see it as that hometown bar and grill that has a great steak.	1
	where you can wear jeans and a polo shirt.	1
	i much rather chow down on that steak than going to smith and wolenski's or peter lugers, where it will cost me a lot more for the same steak, but they put my napkin on my lap for me etc.	1
	maybe i'm in the minority, but i think this is a niche market that isn't as crowded as the luxo area but could be the next hot market.	1

	as an attorney who make 6 figures a year and driving an infinity.	1
	i purchased the azera over the g35, tl, accord, bmw 5 series, avalon and lexus.	1
	why?	1
	because i like the way the car drives.	1
	the fact that i bought the car fully loaded for $24,000 out the door, it was a no brainer.	1
	nobody cares that it is a hyundai.	1
	most don't know until they ask.	1
	then they look again and say, what a nice car.	1
	i could afford any of the above cars, but it made no sense to purchase any of them.	1
	hyundai won me over.	1
	i don't see why other would not eventually follow.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/157#msg157captvege sums this whole thing up very well...        and i echo his thoughts.	1
	only my purchase case involves the 'bottom o' the barrel' cars, the civic's and sephia's and sentra's.	1
	i read kia's competitive literature about the sephia and bought one when they didn't have the long-haul warranty.	1
	kia advertised the sephia as the car college students could put through the wringer and it would come out ticking time after time.	1
	my '99 kia sephia started me on this asian car route i'm still on.	1
	i loved the fresh new styling of the sephia and still think it blows the civic's styling to smithereens.	1
	i loved our next kia just as much, our '01 sportage 4x4.	1
	i noticed good build in both vehicles for less cost.	1
	hyundai does the same but appeals to even more buyers than kia.	1
	but the above post spells it all out, if the car drives right and you like it, who cares about an emblem?	1
	hyundai can call this new luxury car a genesis or a hyundai genesis and it will be a hit and sell in big numbers.	1
	i know they will design and build it right up front.	1
	captvege learned what i learned in the late 90's, hyundai and kia are smart businessmen and great car builders and they have a need to succeed.	1
	they stated they wanted to be number 5 top automaker in the world by the year 2010. they're number 6 right now                 with a bullet.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/158#msg158re: the bottom line is... [paisan]        i doubt if genesis will make much an impact on the market.	1
	1) despite years of trying, hyundai's biggest sedans, sonata and azeri, are not major players in their segments.	1
	when toyota and honda launched lexus and acura, camry, accord, civic and corolla were already major league players.	1
	toyota and honda already proved they had what it takes.	1
	hyundai hasn't proved it yet, in the us.	1
	2) toyota and nissan had years of experience making rwd cars before lexus and infiniti.	1
	remember supra and 240z.	1
	the earliest corollas were rwd.	1
	has hyundai ever made a rwd?	1
	i'm not saying they can't learn, but they might not pull it off right away.	1
	3) the luxury segment is tough.	1
	rl sales are abysmal, a6 is not much better.	1
	even gs sales are skidding.	1
	in that segment, price is not a priority, more people are willing to pay for a badge they prefer.	1
	if acura and audi have trouble, can hyundai do anything?	1
	4) my guess is genesis will end up competing, in price and segment, against 300c, g8 and avalon, rather than 5 series, c class and infiniti m.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/159#msg159where do you draw the line?	1
	how much is too much for a hyundai?	1
	i personally say $25k is the limit, since you can buy plenty of excellent luxury cars for $30k+, with the luxury marque and service to match.	1
	is the argument 'i want the luxury features (frills), but i don't want the luxury badge (another frill).	1
	i want the luxury power, but i don't want luxury service.'	1
	how many people fit into that niche?	1
	not me.	1
	if the car ends up being a 545i for $30k less, than you have something.	1
	my bet is the car is not a success unless it sells 3k a month.	1
	lexus es and acura tl sell 6k a month.	1
	i don't see it, also considering the azera and sonata v6 will dilute their own customer base for this type of vehicle.	1
	much ado about nothing.	1
	build a marque, then talk to me.	1
	it's no chrysler 300.                                                 drfill        	1

	[drfill]        hyundai is considered a luxury car in many parts of the world.	1
	after spending the last 15 years overseas it is a lesson in perception to read these forums.	1
	in korea, a u.s. car is junk and in many parts of the world for that matter.	1
	hyundai is a luxury car in many countries just not here because americans have been conditioned into believing hyundai is miles behind toyota, honda, etc...  the fact is they are not; they build quality cars and can do so cheaper because of their labor structure.	1
	in the states people just don't get it, which is a direct reflection of our very own car companies.	1
	the azera has been around in korea for a long time, under a different name.	1
	it has been the top luxury car for a long time until recently when samsung, that's right, samsung put out a more luxurious car.	1
	people here are concerned with social status and a bmw or lexus etc... is part of that status.	1
	it isnt about a good quality car; it is about what everyone else thinks.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/170#msg170re: genesis luxury division [gamleged]        time and history puts brand conscientiousness in perspective.	1
	for example, i remember when i, and other sailors, started bringing back national, and other asian brands, hi-fi components and electronics back from japan in the early '60s.	1
	during that time, ge, philco, rca, magnavox, admiral, etc.	1
	were american brands, all made in plants in the usa.	1
	everyone scoffed at national (read: panasonic), sony, and other japanese brands were brought into the country.	1
	junk, junk, junk - everyone said.	1
	exactly the same thing occurred when toyota, nissan, and honda first hit these shores.	1
	most americans laughed at them, and never perceived them as 'real' vehicles.	1
	look who's laughing now.	1
	the gentleman from korea has a very valid point and observation regarding us - the american consumer.	1
	every american consumer should travel to other parts of the world to observe product perception and acceptance.	1
	our arrogance and gravitas is well known worldwide - we could learn a lot from listening to and observing others.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/171#msg171re: so........... [nycdc911]         vw phaeton didn't sell, hyundai genesis won't sell.	1
	unless you're a fortune teller, this is speculation at best.	1
	the fact a new luxury brand would have zero brand recognition initially, and, there would be no guarantee the brand would do well and able to sustain.	1
	on the other hand, the hyundai brand, despite its past history, has done a great job on becoming where they are today.	1
	don't be surprised how many units hyundai would be able to move, especially considering its favorable pricing against the competitors.	1
	the pricing, however, would probably adjust upward under the luxury tag.	1
	keep in mind also, the initial target has not been set very high - 20k units/year iirc for the north american market.	1
	as noted earlier, i do believe hyundai should and will setup its luxury division, but not in the near-term.	1
	hyundai is doing a great job and has made dramatic improvements in a short time.	1
	hyundai should keep doing what they are doing right now, and everything will fall into its place.	1
	setting up the luxury brand at this point will neither harm nor benefit the automaker anymore than its current position.	1

	re: phaeton vw made an incorrect assessment in the us, as few purchased a $60k+ phaeton; however, i'd predict there are going to more than a few purchasing the $30k bh/genesis (check the azera demographics, and one would agree consumers are ready for a 30k+ hyundai).	1
	hyundai is copying toyota in everything it does, just look at the camry grill on the genesis!	1
	to me, it bears little (actually, no) resemblance.	1
	in person, the car is what the camry should have been, truth to be told.	1
	hyundai did not go back to the drawing board after they saw the camry last year.	1

	of my last 4 brand new cars i've bought, i've spend a grand total of 5-6hrs at the dealership and most of that was when i was buying them.	1
	any warranty repairs i've done (few and far between) have involved an after hours drop off and pickup, and most 'working' folks do it that way.	1

	i'm not sure what the pricing was on the w8 passat, but i think it was priced fairly high, also they were marketing it as a fwd vehicle to people who were in the passat market, these folks liked relatively fuel efficient fwd cars who if they were spending for the w8 would jump to the a6 or a bmw 5 series rather than stick with a vw fwd vehicle.	1

	you will spend a few hours at the dealership when you buy the car as opposed to hundreds of hours a year inside the car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/178#msg178re: paisan [snakeweasel]        vw's w8 passat bombed recently and cost $37,900 in 2003 with virtually all amenities including awd standard.	1
	hyundai needs to learn from vw's mistakes with the w8 and phaeton.	1
	after all, people refused to buy a luxury vw even though they knew vw/audi had years of experience making great luxury cars like the well reviewed phaeton/a8 and touareg/q7.	1
	vw as a well respected european brand had a much higher chance of success than hyundai, much joked about new korean brand that's still known for making the cheapest cars in america.	1
	rockylee and paisan think blue collar working class people will somehow be able to afford a $35,000 car, and that hyundai can become the same thing as lexus, i think there's no way either of those things happens.	1
	others on this thread think hyundai can only sell a car costing up to $40,000 with a new luxury brand.	1
	so let's say both groups of people are right.	1
	the luxury brand advocates won't buy an expensive hyundai while the working class luxury shoppers if they exist will buy it.	1
	so then calling it a hyundai is only selling to a fraction of the potential market.	1
	nobody on here has said that they'd refuse to buy this hyundai genesis if it dropped the hyundai name and was called something different as part of a new luxury genesis brand.	1
	and why would they, owning a luxury brand car can only be a positive, even to the so called blue collar luxury shoppers.	1
	so a luxury brand genesis m sedan would potentially sell 30,000 cars a year: 15,000 to luxury owners and 15,000 to economy owners looking to move up.	1
	calling the same car a hyundai would only result in 1/3 the sales, 10,000 among economy owners looking to move up but also considering true luxury brands and outstanding cars like the g35x.	1
	the real question is, why would hyundai want to sell 1/3 as many cars by calling it a hyundai instead of a new luxury brand like genesis?	1
	and following the lexus formula, with a luxury division hyundai/genesis can jack up the prices quickly if the car is a big hit and make even more money, while obviously hyundai would never be able to do that.	1
	so not only would they sell 1/3 as many cars calling it a hyundai, they'd be making far less profit per car in the future with no hope of growth.	1
	also calling it a hyundai would be killing off any hope of a future luxury division since there'd be no way to top the genesis while still keeping the first luxury division car affordable to their customers.	1
	let's not be naive, this isn't a discussion about what's best for a certain rare consumer like rockylee or paisan.	1
	what's best for the company's profits, what should hyundai do for its shareholders?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/179#msg179re: paisan [nycdc911]        vw's w8 passat bombed recently and cost $38,000 fully loaded                                iirc the w8 passat fully loaded was well north of 49 grand, thats a lot for a car with basically 2 v4 engines attached to it.	1
	that had a lot to do with the demise of the w8.	1
	plus it was a wv passat.	1
	rockylee and paisan think blue collar working class people will somehow be able to afford a $35,000 car                                they buy them all the time.	1
	a top of the line avalon will be close to 35 grand and those are sold all the time.	1
	calling the same car a hyundai would only result in 1/3 the sales, 10,000 among economy owners looking to move up but also considering true luxury brands and outstanding cars like the g35x.	1
	your logic is flawed but i have no time to enplain it now so remind me and i will talk about this later.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/180#msg180re: paisan [snakeweasel]         http://www.europeancarweb.com/longtermers/0308ec_2003_volkswagen_passat_w8/                                'european car drove the passat w8 last year, and the first sentence out of staffers mouths was 'what a great car.'	1
	the second was 'can we have one?'	1
	much to our delight, the answer was yes.	1
	our long-term 2003 passat w8 recently arrived fully loaded, as do all the w8s.	1
	its $37,900 msrp may take many aback (a $38k vw?	1
	), but once you tally up all the features you get, the price seems right on target.'	1
	well according to multiple articles, a fully loaded w8 passat cost $37,900 and nowhere near 50 grand as you claim, but please post a link to this 50 grand vw passat or admit your mistake/lie and refrain from posting falsehoods again.	1
	even those advocating hyundai not start a luxury brand admit that luxury owners will not buy the genesis if it's called a hyundai and the luxury brand advocates agree with that.	1
	however a new luxury brand like genesis could attract many entry level luxury owners, especially from acura, infiniti, lexus, cadillac, lincoln, saab, volvo.	1
	and obviously calling it a new luxury brand name like genesis will not prevent any of the so called blue collar luxury shoppers from buying it if they would have bought it as a hyundai.	1
	if it's the same car they're getting, everyone would prefer it have a prestigious luxury division name instead of a hyundai which sells the cheapest cars in the civilized world.	1
	so 15,000 luxury owners could buy a new luxury division genesis m, plus 15,000 economy owners moving up.	1
	none of the luxury owners would consider a hyundai, and of the 15,000 economy owners moving up, 5000 will choose the added prestige of a luxury brand with outstanding cars like the infiniti g35x.	1
	so that's 10,000 cars in a year, 1/3 the sales of calling it a luxury brand name.	1
	also, let's look at future pricing.	1
	since journalists are already going crazy over this car and hyundai is planning on making it better handling than bmws with same engine size but roomier than lexus' flagship ls460 for a fraction of the price, reviews should be outstanding.	1
	sales should be great if it's the start of a new luxury division which in itself will cause tons of press and excitement.	1
	calling it a genesis m will allow hyundai/genesis to increase prices quickly within the first few years while hyundai won't be able to do that.	1
	lexus launched ls400 for $35,000 in 89 and in 94 it cost $50,000.	1
	if genesis lux brand does the same, extra $15000 means 3-4x as much net profit per car.	1
	along with 3x the sales, hyundai/genesis would make ten times as much money compared to calling it a hyundai.	1
	and also remember that 95% of luxury buyers are completely uninterested in this thread and any hyundai, so don't be fooled just because there are a few people here who think a $40,000 hyundai will sell.	1
	there are a number of people on this thread alone who disagree and have history and common sense on their side when they advocate a new luxury brand, and 20 times as many people who are luxury buyers not even bothering with an economy hyundai thread agree since they'd also only buy luxury brands.	1
	hyundai wants to make money.	1
	a hyundai genesis would flop just like vw's $37,900 w8 passat or phaeton.	1
	obviously the best way to succeed is by starting a luxury division but selling cars for $20,000 less than the competition like lexus did, buyers will flock to a new genesis luxury brand just like with lexus, it's a proven formula for success.	1
	history tells us what flops, and history tells us what works.	1
	a basic understanding of human nature and the auto industry tells us the same thing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/181#msg181re: paisan [nycdc911]        i think the biggest issue of starting a new division is the cost and time.	1
	i'm not opposed to it, but the cost to start a new dealership network i would think would outweigh the gains.	1
	you aren't going to get any of the bmw/mb/caddy folks to buy a hyundai even under the veil of a 'luxury brand' so i just feel it's a waste of cash.	1
	if however this car takes off and really is a hot seller, at that point they should look at spinning off the car and launch a brand.	1
	i think we are all generally on the same page here despite some people feeling strong on one side or the other.	1

	kia and hyundai have way too many cheap cars that compete against each other in the same price range like the failing gm and ford/mercury.	1
	kia/hyundai should simplify their product line like toyota, nissan, honda, and other successful car companies.	1
	not only do kias compete against hyundais, hyundais compete against hyundais, and kias against kias.	1
	just check out how many different cheap kia suvs have the same price, it's insane.	1
	slowly they could phase out excess models and save money, then just combine the two brands under the kia name.	1
	hyundai is just a horrible and hard to pronounce name, it sounds way too much like honda except worse which is what people think of hyundai's cheaper products.	1
	even hyundai's logo looks like a honda logo that got run over and mangled.	1
	kia is actually the oldest car company in korea, and the name sounds cool like korea without the 'or'.	1
	kia means 'rising from asia' and it goes well with a luxury brand named genesis.	1
	new logos could be made out of an oval or diamond surrounding a k, or a g that looks like an almost closed circle with a radius line.	1
	kia/genesis could be like toyota/lexus and be positioned to become the world's #1 carmaker.	1
	kia motors wouldn't even need a lower priced line like scion since it's already cheap.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/183#msg183re: paisan [paisan]        again history shows us the right path.	1
	hyundai can't spin off the genesis into a luxury brand after it becomes a hot seller.	1
	lexus introduced a brand new car ls400 that revolutionized the auto industry.	1
	the ls400 wasn't a second generation toyota and lexus wouldn't have succeeded if it was.	1
	nobody cared about the es250 which was a rebadged camry and gone in 2 years.	1
	the genesis is the second coming of the ls400, a rwd/awd v8 top of the line luxury sedan for $20,000 less, history tells us it can't fail if it is the beginning of a new luxury brand.	1
	and history tells us a hyundai genesis will fail like the w8 passat and phaeton, nobody even knew those cars existed, and yet another hyundai would get lost in the shuffle and completely ignored by luxury buyers.	1
	creating a whole new luxury car company generates an incredible amount of buzz and excitement, and would more than triple sales.	1
	genesis v8 rivals lexus' flagship ls460 and blows away anything by acura, infiniti, lincoln, saab, volvo, their customers will flock to genesis for a better car at a fraction of the price, along with intelligent bmw/mb buyers and toyota/gm/ford owners moving up.	1
	since hyundai is eventually going to spend money to start a luxury brand, what's the point in delaying it other than losing a ton of sales, profit, and market share for the genesis?	1
	hyundai would have to top its genesis to start a luxury brand later and that would be damn near impossible, they can't sell a 400-500 hp car for $50,000.	1
	hyundai has some of the worst dealerships around, that's why they're being dropped left and right.	1
	hyundai and kia customers don't have money and the salespeople have no clue how to sell luxury cars.	1
	they should just convert or build new genesis dealerships and hire experienced luxury salespeople or train the best ones to sell the new genesis m sedan and x suv (rebadged veracruz).	1
	like i said, they should eventually combine kia and hyundai into just kia motors along with the genesis luxury division.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/184#msg184you basically agree with me        hyundai is selling this concept as if it were a new merceds or lexus model, but it will be a hyundai.	1
	hyundai, and vw for that matter, are two peas in a pod.	1
	they've built there reps on selling basic cars to average people.	1
	they can't just start selling $30-40k cars because they feel like it, and expect it to fly.	1
	they aren't toyota.	1
	avalon is nothing like the genesis.	1
	avalon is a full-sized toyota family sedan, with upscale features.	1
	it is not marketed as a budget lexus, or a discount something.	1
	it is a luxurious full-sized car.	1
	that's all.	1
	hyundai is not toyota.	1
	they are not comparable at this point.	1
	maybe 10-15 years from now.	1
	maybe.	1
	probably not.	1
	the v8 genesis will base price somewhere in the $33-35 range, and commonly msrp south of $40k.	1
	so it maybe $5k less than the passat was.	1
	how much will you spend on a hyundai?	1
	that's the only question that matters.	1
	hyundai sold less than 27k azera last year.	1
	$25k is gonna be the limit for many, many people.	1
	drop the azera, and it will definitely help the genesis!	1
	i don't see how these two could work together.	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/185#msg185re: you basically agree with me [drfill]        genesis and azera work together if they're in separate divisions, genesis should be the first car in a new luxury brand.	1
	azera is the real avalon competitor, a full size fwd car at a cheaper price.	1
	and since avalon is toyota's most expensive model, azera should be hyundai/kia's most expensive model.	1
	to be #1, you have to beat #1, and offering toyota/lexus like products at a much cheaper price is an unbeatable way to do it, and a hyundai is not a lexus like product and never will be.	1
	honestly, i can't even believe we're having this discussion.	1
	a car that's roomier than an ls460 with the same engine size, and better than anything acura, infiniti, lincoln, saab, volvo, has ever made, is going to be sold as a hyundai?!?	1

	i have owned an '85 cressida, and a '95 avalon.	1

	i still have the '95 avalon, and it has 178,000 miles on the clock.	1
	i had a rebuilt steering rack installed and had an engine oil leak fixed.	1
	only my remote entry system has failed, but, as a pre-war baby, i still remember how to use a key to open a door, so i couldn't be persuaded to spend a ton of money for a little thing like that.	1
	i had every intention of replacing the avalon with another one, but after i had walked into a hyundai showroom just on a whim, examined the azera, and had taken it for a test ride, i was just blown away with the build quality, features, roominess, power, etc...and equally importantly, the price !	1
	.	1
	i figure i walked away with a quality purchase equal to or surpassing an avalon for at least $5,000 less.	1
	and, in case you folks haven't looked at the avalon forum, they are still having problems with a quirky transmission, which apparently toyota won't admit even exists.	1
	i've read pages of this discussion about genesis and hyundai in general, and i am appalled at how many contributors are so damned hung-up over a name !!!	1
	suppose the azera had appeared on the market with absolutely no advertsing, no badges of any kind,  and no way in the world of identifying it as a product of hyundai motors.... the only thing to do was to examine it for features, build quality, etc.... what would the folks who are so damned hung-up on a name say then?	1
	these are, i believe, the same people who cheerfully want to see an item of clothing with a 'designer' label on it on their backs, say a $60.00 tommy hilfiger shirt, made in bangladesh by some poor woman who earns 25 cents an hour in a sweatshop, and won't buy one from l.l.	1
	bean for less than half the price, even though the bean garment is every bit as good or better.	1
	i had a chance to buy another toyota, but i'll be damned if i'll spend that kind of dough on something which doesn't give me the quality that i found in my new azera!       	1

	hyundai and kia customers don't have money and the salespeople have no clue how to sell luxury cars.	1
	they should just convert or build new genesis dealerships and hire experienced luxury salespeople or train the best ones to sell the new genesis m sedan and x suv (rebadged veracruz).	1
	like i said, they should eventually combine kia and hyundai into just kia motors along with the genesis luxury division.'	1

	something must be catching in the ny area.	1
	saying 'hyundai and kia customers don't have money .	1
	.	1
	.'	1
	may have been true at one time, but not now.	1
	for example, one of my colleague's husband is a toyota service manager at a large dealership in palm beach, fl (not really an economically-strapped community), and guess what kind of vehicle she drives: a new kia sedona - on his recommendation no less.	1
	my neighbor who is a retired cardiologist drives a hyundai sonata limited, and i could go on.	1
	i know quite a few people with incomes north of $100k that drive hyundais.	1
	and why would hyundai want to be sold under kia motors, since hyundai bailed kia out of bankruptcy some years ago, and owns kia - hyundai is the parent company, not vice versa.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/191#msg191re: you basically agree with me [drfill]        no, hyundai is selling this car for people who want luxury features but can't afford luxury cars yet.	1
	what was toyota in the late 80's when lexus was launched?	1
	a lot of people scoffed that the maker of the corolla was trying its hand at luxury.	1
	but they earned their stripes the hard and smart way, they offered more for less with a very high level of dealership attention.	1
	still, the people who bought mercedes did not jump ship to lexus for several more years, rather it was those who aspired to buy mercedes but could not afford them who jumped on the lexus bandwagon.	1
	lets not rewrite history here.	1
	toyota was not the big dog in the late 80's like they are today.	1
	in fact, hyundai may be in better financial position now then toyota was then.	1
	toyota was able to launch lexus not because their revenues could support it but because they new they would have the support from the japanese financial institutions if things failed.	1
	i'm not suggesting that hyundai can jump in and play with the big boys now, but if they do it right (the lexus way) and aim for those who are buying es's and give them something close to an ls for a little more or the same as that es they could do well.	1
	then as their reputation grows so can their prices.	1
	it might take a decade or more to get to the same level as lexus but if you don't start you'll never get there.	1
	i think you should take a step back and look at the big picture.	1
	things never stay the same and perceptions change.	1
	five years ago, the people who are buying hyundai's now would only buy toyota's or honda's.	1
	hyundai could not sell a car for more than 15k.	1
	now they can sell cars for 30k, the volumes may not be what toyota's are but they are growing.	1
	just remember the race does not always go to the swiftest.	1
	a luxury hyundai division is not the folly you think it may be.	1
	i believe that if you think with your head and not your loyalties you would see that.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/192#msg192re: you basically agree with me [docrw]         toyota was not the big dog in the late 80's like they are today.	1
	toyota didn't have a luxury presence, but was already big back then.	1
	my guess is accord and camry, along with taurus, were already the top dogs in family sedan, and civic and corolla among the top in economy class.	1
	where are sonata and elentra today?	1
	they're nowhere near what accord et al were back in the 80's, despite years and generations of trying.	1
	ford came out with taurus specifically to fight camry and accord.	1
	ditto escort in fighting civic and corolla!	1
	has any car ever had the mission of fighting sonata and elantra?	1
	which hyundai is among the leader of its class?	1
	not one, hyundai hasn't proved it can produce a hit of any kind.	1
	and now it wants a v8 luxury sedan.	1
	i read hyundai had wanted a luxury brand for many years now, and its own dealers told hq in korea to cool it!	1
	so its dealers had doubts.	1
	in many respects, hyundai resembles detroit 3 more than nippon 3.  in residual value, sonata is nowhere near accord/camry/altima territory.	1
	and hyundai sells a much larger % to rentals than nippon.	1
	when mb drops chrysler, there might not be another 300, which borrows some tech from previous e.  any potential buyer should insist mb assist in the development of next 300, which is the lifeblood of chrysler.	1
	that might be a price mb must pay for riddance.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/193#msg193so you basically agree with me too!	1
	apparently, my recent posts were not read by all (shame on you!).	1
	my issue is selling this genesis as a                 hyundai.	1
	hyundai                is the problem, not the car.	1
	the car may be the next lexus ls.	1
	but if you sell it as a                 hyundai                , you got no chance.	1
	as in zero.	1
	and selling ther azera and another vehicle on top of it, one of the cars will suffer greatly.	1
	it appears hyundai sees that handwriting on the wall.	1
	i don't have a problem with hyundai starting a luxury channel.	1
	it probably is the right time, and a smart move.	1
	acura                 refuses                to learn from their mistakes.	1
	and infiniti has always struggled to develop a proper flagship, as has acura.	1
	and cadillac, for that matter.	1
	if hyundai wants to copy the lexus formula, go 'head!	1
	they'll need another vehicle to complement the genseis (not the azera), but, at this point, i'm tired of acura.	1
	they may need a little help with a going out of business sale.	1
	acura has no direction, no focus.	1
	comparing hyundai (today) to toyota (1989) is fair, except for the fact that toyota had built a solid reputation for the previous decade of building quality cars.	1
	they were established as a leader in the industry.	1
	hyundai has had what....2-3 good years?	1
	they're not there....yet.	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/194#msg194underestimation        many of you, unlike toyota and many others, are severely underestimating a company that has increased its sales 320% in the last few years and was the only company to have survived the korean economic downfall.	1
	oh thats right, they not only survived it but they bought up kia (51%).	1
	they have also soared in quality ratings, although controversial.	1
	hyundai's plants are the worlds most advanced and they have very, very deep pockets.	1
	if this works, it works, if it doesn't, it doesn't.	1
	some of you just can't accept the world is changing and the likes of korean companies like samsung, lg, hyundai and kia are poised or already have entered the upper echelon of powerful companies.	1
	i am amused at how entrenched and how opposed to progress many of you are.	1
	what world are you living in?	1
	do some of you even get the idea of change and progress?	1
	do some of you even understand that when a company has a vision and launches out like this, its a good thing.	1
	keep one thing in mind: the genesis and the emergence of a sister marque to hyundai is nothing but good news to me, joe carbuyer.	1
	it forces the marginal companies to either shape up or get out and it forces the dominant players to become even more competitive and reconsider they quality, inflated prices and decontenting policies.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/195#msg195re: underestimation [prosource1]          which hyundai is among the leader of its class?	1
	not one, hyundai hasn't proved it can produce a hit of any kind.	1
	and now it wants a v8 luxury sedan.	1
	i see hyundai as a solid hitter, you know the one who hit's doubles and is a good base runner, as well as a good defensive player.	1
	yeah he doesn't smack the home runs or get all the girls at the china club after the game, but he's a solid player and gets things done.	1
	-mike       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/196#msg196now add to the above the fact        that hyundai is a                 smart player                and                 driven to succeed                and you'll start to understand why hyundai will be successful supplying the luxury car buyer, calling it the genesis or the hyundai genesis.	1
	yeah, i realized how archaeic and slow the american car buying public was to realizing new car making talent when i purchased my kia sephia in may of '99.	1
	it was mostly online commenters that were out-of-touch with reality, thinking that buying a kia was akin to getting incurable tb.	1
	the sephia product was good and the sportage product was even better and hyundai is more popular than kia.	1
	so why is it unthinkable that hyundai moves upscale in product content?	1
	and even if it is unsuccessful hyundai will not vanish from the scene nor will kia motors.	1
	think of them as automotive powerhouses if you're not already and you'll have a cup of sanity back.	1
	been down this block several times or two by now and buying for brand recognition is not only dumb it's way too lemming-like for me.	1
	how about actually comparing the automobiles attributes here and not the brand name?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/197#msg197i hope hyundai        doesn't create a luxury brand.	1
	not right now at least.	1
	i have a feeling hyundai knows their brand image isn't that great right now.. so investing all that money and time and energy into a 'luxury' brand that everyone will see right through will be pointless.	1
	i think the way hyundai is approaching it is perfect.	1
	slowly rebuild your image, prove to everyone that you can make great cars at a great price with great warranties.. and go after the 'i want something luxury but don't want to spend the money on image cuz i don't really care about image' crowd is just fine.	1
	i think hyundai's aim is squarely at the chrysler 300 crowd.. or maybe even the acura tl.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/207#msg207separate dealerships or not        hmm..  ballpark, it probably costs about 3-4 mil to build a nice dealership from square one - if they do the seperate brand.	1
	that will affect car price somehow.	1
	while i would have no issue buying a genesis (if i were not looking diesel next year) i think a lot of luxury marque buyers might not do so.	1

	cadillac's problem is they have priced the sts around $10-15k higher than my 2002 seville sts.	1
	while this generation sts improved it wasn't dramatic enough to charge that much more.	1
	the sts, also has been manufactored cheaper because the uaw workers now assemble the sts in teams and no longer do just 1-3 jobs.	1
	so i think gm, should of held it's end of the 'total value pricing' and kept prices in check while giving the consumer more.	1
	so now cadillac, has to put major cash on the hood in the spring to move these cars which ultimately kills resale value and credibility.	1
	i suppose i could wait for these deals but even with those deals the genesis, will still be $15k+ cheaper unless cadillac, wants to move the 07's.	1

	[floridabob1]        well if your a rich man why bother with the genesis, some will say.....however the genesis, under whatever brand hyundai, decides will sell in huge volumes if they watch the price and offer the consumer as much as they say they will under $40,000 it will do well.	1
	they then should come up with a twin- turbo 500 hp tau v8 version of the genesis, with even more 'stuff' for around $45k or so.	1

	if hyundai actually creates new luxury division just like                infiniti and lexus, it is a gamble,but sometimes you just                have to take that chance.	1
	even though it will cost lots of money for new division, in                my opinion pricing will be critical.	1
	compare to infiniti or                lexus, price has to be at least 15% less than them.	1
	not                because lesser quality or content, but that's the way to                get into the market they never had.	1
	that's how lexus did it.	1
	if hyundai do this project correctly they will be successful.	1
	however it will not be easy.	1
	someone(other luxury brands) will have to suffer.	1
	at least in u.s. there                are many people who wants luxury or very near luxury cars                for $30 to $40k.       	1

	i said north of 40k, there is a big difference.	1
	the sites i read stated it started near 40k.	1
	so unless there were no optional equipment then a fully loaded one would be more.	1
	even those advocating hyundai not start a luxury brand admit that luxury owners will not buy the genesis if it's called a hyundai                                thats because many of us believe that hyundai is                 not                targeting luxury car owners, but those who maybe want more for less.	1
	and obviously calling it a new luxury brand name like genesis will not prevent any of the so called blue collar luxury shoppers from buying it if they would have bought it as a hyundai.	1
	it could very well stop them from considering the genesis.	1
	for the exact same reason they wouldn't consider a benz, bmw or lexus.	1
	that being that it is a luxury badge and they don't want to pay the extra cost for a nameplate.	1
	if it's the same car they're getting, everyone would prefer it have a prestigious luxury division name instead of a hyundai which sells the cheapest cars in the civilized world.	1
	be careful your bias is showing.	1
	iirc chevy sells the cheapest car (read least expensive) car in the us.	1
	hyundai sell good cars for less money.	1
	and of the 15,000 economy owners moving up, 5000 will choose the added prestige                                or those 5,000 will choose an upscale honda or toyota or some other make and not even consider a 'luxury brand'.	1
	or if they choose to go upscale they would more likely take an establish brand.	1
	sales should be great if it's the start of a new luxury division which in itself will cause tons of press and excitement.	1
	yes and guess how much greater it would be with the name of a company that is fast becoming know for providing great cars for less money.	1
	and also remember that 95% of luxury buyers are completely uninterested in this thread and any hyundai,                                and what makes you think they would be interested in a rebadged hyundai?	1
	a hyundai genesis would flop just like vw's $37,900 w8 passat or phaeton.	1
	the phaeton started north of 60 grand which is why it flopped.	1
	a hyundai genesis starting at under half that price will sell well enough.	1
	history tells us what flops,                                yes history does and i wonder if the word 'sterling' ever pops up in the minds of hyundai execs when they think of starting a new luxury division.       	1

	really?	1
	we could afford all but a few cars sold today and me and the wife drives hyundais as our daily drives.	1
	the nearest hyundai dealer to me also sells buicks and saabs so i would think they have some experience in selling luxury.       	1

	creating a whole new luxury car company generates an incredible amount of buzz and excitement, and would more than triple sales.	1
	i am really amazed by your logic.	1
	you're relying on history as almost all of your basis?	1
	somehow if history dictated where hyundai would be today, then i would suggest we go back and re-write history because hyundai has proven history wrong.	1
	point being, it's way too early to write the genesis off, especially from a company called hyundai.	1
	they've got too much success and drive to fail.	1
	many things cannot happen overnight.	1
	for one, there is no guarantee a luxury division would proven with any better success than its hyundai brand, not to mention the complicated process setting up the brand, dealer networks, timing, and other issues which would need to be sorted out.	1
	it's not as easy as 1-2-3, contrary to your position.	1
	hyundai has some of the worst dealerships around, that's why they're being dropped left and right.	1
	hyundai and kia customers don't have money and the salespeople have no clue how to sell luxury cars.	1
	with all due respect, that is one of the most ignorant statements i've heard in a long time.	1
	you really need to do some research before posting incorrect info or criticism.	1
	and, the demographics of the azera owners would indicate otherwise.	1
	no, hyundai customers are not strap for cash, as close to 90% have gone with the top (limited) trim and within, many opted for the ultimate package.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/236#msg236re: paisan [joe97]        i will gross between $60-70k this year.	1

	i sometimes think i am.	1
	brightness04, says that puts me in the top 20% and yes i'm considering a hyundai, as my next car.	1

	i'd rather be wise with my money and apply it torwards investments, spending it on vacations, wife, kids, than on a luxury emblem that means zilch to me.	1

	if i was a business man and saw some slob in a well know luxury emblem i would think this guy either is very wealthy or is living like somebody he isn't.	1

	in korea i drove a samsung sm7 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samsung_sm7), in japan i drove a toyota crown, in kuwait i drove a mercedes, in germany and italy i drove a bmw, etc...  point is i am back in the u.s. now and have 2 cars, a lexus ls 460l and a hyundai azera limited.	1
	the lexus is by far a much more luxurious vehicle and should be, it wasn't cheap.	1
	i could by 3 azera's for the price of the lexus.	1
	my point is that hyundai is a quality built vehicle, is it 83k quality, no... but it is far superior to any american tagged car and a much better value than a bmw, mercedes, toyota, honda, etc...  korea is the 6th largest manufacture of cars and have to date the most advanced manufacturing facility in the world.	1
	americans are easily influenced by commercials and quite honestly far behind in many products available to the public.	1
	take the cell phone; i recently watched an advertisement for a phone that does tv, which has been overseas for a long time, just now coming to the u.s.  the phones overseas are much nicer than here also, even american brands such as motorola sells nicer phones overseas than here.	1
	the fact is we are getting our butts kicked like never before but unless you actually get out of this little world you live in within these boarders you would never know that.	1
	i am not anti-american, i am a proud american who is realistic and have seen what other countries have to offer and i can tell you from my perspective we are behind just about every country i mentioned except russia and peru in so many ways that if i even mentioned 1/100 of them i would need to be in a political forum.	1
	bottom line, hyundai is a solid deal in quality, quantity and safety and quite frankly is a better deal than any of those other brands i have or am driving.	1

	that had a lot to do with the demise of the w8.	1
	plus it was a wv passat. '	1
	in the post above you said the w8 passat was well north of 49 grand, but it actually cost $37,900 fully loaded like the hyundai genesis, and bombed like the phaeton because nobody was willing to pay that much for a vw.	1
	also, mazda's millenia started at $31,000 in 99 after it was forced to slash $4000 off the msrp due to slow sales 4 years after its introduction, and nobody bought it at either price because it wasn't a luxury brand.	1
	by contrast, lexus' ls400 debuted at $35,000 in 89 and sold for $50,000 in 94 because the new luxury brand was a huge success and it wasn't just an expensive toyota.	1
	instead of having to cut prices because nobody wants to pay $35,000 for a hyundai, starting a new luxury division like lexus could lead to increasing prices to $50,000 and 3-4 times as much net profit per car.	1
	if hyundai starts a new luxury brand for genesis, 15,000 luxury owners and 15,000 economy owners moving up could buy the new car.	1
	calling it a hyundai, none of the luxury buyers would be interested, and many of the economy owners moving up want to actually move up to a real luxury brand instead of moving down to a hyundai which is known for making the cheapest cars available.	1
	so only 10,000 would be sold, prices would be slashed, and the car discontinued.	1
	not only would hyundai sell 3 times as many cars by starting a luxury brand, they could make 3-4 times as much money per car in a few years, and make 10 times as much money as they could by calling the genesis a hyundai.	1
	young rich people are way too image conscious to be caught dead in a hyundai, and old rich people wouldn't even know a hyundai genesis existed.	1
	nobody knew the w8 passat existed, it wasn't in any comparison tests with lux cars or mentioned in car magazines.	1
	a hyundai genesis would be ignored and fail, but starting a luxury brand with a catchy and ambitious name like genesis would generate huge buzz and sales, pay huge dividends immediately and could eventually catapult hyundai into the world's #1 carmaker.	1
	kia motors should be the name of kia/genesis after excess hyundai/kia models that compete against each other are phased out over the next few years.	1
	the hyundai name is too similar to honda and so is the logo which looks like a roadkill honda logo.	1
	hyundai sounds unpleasant in western languages just like equus or the ssangyong wz, another korean car which could rival the genesis if it changes the name of the company and model.	1
	bottom line is hyundai doesn't want to make 1/10 as much money as they could make with the genesis, and that's why they're planning a luxury division.	1
	they could start with this genesis m midsize sedan and x rebadged veracruz suv, then add s small sedan, l large sedan, c hardtop convertible/coupe, and v crossover minivan/portico.       	1

	hyundai genesis concept                hyundais global aspirations know no bounds, as concept genesis shows.	1
	genesis, as we know, means birth or coming into being, and this concept is likely to spawn the birth of hyundais as-yet unnamed luxury offshoot brand  think lexus is to toyota as concept genesis would be to hyundai.	1
	this rear-wheel drive, v8-powered concept sedan is eye-catching in the metal, and will be released in production form next year initially in left-hand-drive markets, is designed to demonstrate hyundais rapidly growing design ability.	1
	with a 4.6-litre v8 under the bonnet, the rear-wheel-drive genesis is pitched at competitive sports sedans like the lexus gs, bmw 5-series and audi a6.	1
	while the idea of a luxury sports sedan from hyundai may surprise, the company believes its consistently good results in us and european quality surveys will underpin its entry.	1
	hyundai recently came third in the us jd power quality survey, ahead of many respected brands, while in germany a survey by auto zeitung magazine found hyundai cars had the fewest breakdowns of any marque.'	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/241#msg241genesis and azera        just recall that hyundai has not added back to the azera us model many of the features that were eliminated from the korean version, such as navigation, smart key, lazar cruise control, tilt in reverse side view mirrors etc.	1
	they also have not corrected some of the simple issues such as the requirement to have key in ignition to operate memory seats and including the power pedals into the memory function.	1
	before jumping into a new, even more high tech, model they should complete the azera project.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/242#msg242re: paisan [nycdc911]         in the post above you said the w8 passat was well north of 49 grand,                                sorry it was a typo it should have been 40 ( a fat finger mistake as the 9 and 0 are next to each other and why use such a odd number for an approximation, you should be smart enough to figure that one out).	1
	but it actually cost $37,900 fully loaded                                fully loaded it was over 40k as i saw one in at the dealership where i bought my car.	1
	bombed like the phaeton because nobody was willing to pay that much for a vw.	1
	i will type this very slowly so you can understand this.	1
	the phaeton started at more than twice what the genesis will start at.	1
	a top of the line genesis fully loaded will come in 10's of thousands less than the phaeton, so you cannot use the phaeton as an example.	1
	also, mazda's millenia                                someone else was using that as an example so i will let that one go.	1
	instead of having to cut prices because nobody wants to pay $35,000 for a hyundai, starting a new luxury division like lexus could lead to increasing prices to $50,000 and 3-4 times as much net profit per car.	1
	here you say that no one wants to pay 35k for a hyundai but then you say they can sell the same hyundai for $50k.	1
	that doesn't make sense.	1
	but lets look at it this way, increasing the price to $50k means fewer cars sold (even if it is luxury nameplate) so while they make more profit per car, they sell fewer cars.	1
	tell me if toyota took the lexus is 250 and rebadged it as a toyota and sold it for 10% less don't you think they would sell a lot more?	1
	calling it a hyundai, none of the luxury buyers would be interested,                                again i will type this slowly so that you will understand.	1
	it is apparent that hyundai is not interested in the current crop of luxury car buyers but those who would like something more but don't want to spend 10 grand or more to get it.	1
	young rich people are way too image conscious to be caught dead in a hyundai,                                i know at least one young rich person who drive an azera and another young rich person who drives an accent.	1
	image conscious people are just snobs, not all rich people, young or old are snobs.	1
	and old rich people wouldn't even know a hyundai genesis existed.	1
	how would you know?	1
	the car isn't out yet no one knows who will know its out or not.	1
	i would suspect that when the genesis comes out older rich people would know about it.	1
	there is something in this world called advertising.	1
	nobody knew the w8 passat existed,                                just because vw didn't market the w8 passat doesn't mean that hyundai will not market the genesis.	1
	a hyundai genesis would be ignored and fail,                                and just how accurate is your crystal ball?	1
	if a hyundai genesis will be ignored (from what i am seeing now it certainly isn't being ignored) then wouldn't a luxury nameplate also be ignored?	1
	but starting a luxury brand with a catchy and ambitious name like genesis would generate huge buzz and sales,                                but right now just having a hyundai genesis is creating a buzz.	1
	and there is no guarantee that introducing a luxury nameplate will be sucessfull (sterling).	1
	and could eventually catapult hyundai into the world's #1 carmaker.	1
	i would think that they have a good shot at that now as they have already climbed to #5.                                 the hyundai name is too similar to honda                                so?	1
	i guess you will be writing to bf goodrich to tell them to change their name because its to similar to goodyear.	1
	hyundai sounds unpleasant in western languages                                thats subjective and many would disagree with you.	1
	bottom line is hyundai doesn't want to make 1/10 as much money as they could make with the genesis,                                there is no guarantee that they will make more money selling it as a luxury nameplate, and a strong argument can be made that they can make more selling it as a hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/243#msg243re: paisan [snakeweasel]        the points in my posts that you failed to address is why you have no argument.	1
	and i should have said that instead of making 10 times as much money with a luxury brand, hyundai/genesis could make 20 times as much money as just calling it a hyundai.	1
	that's because mazda had to slash $4000 off the price of the millenia making it $32,000 and cutting net profit per car in half or less.	1
	while lexus increased the price of ls400 from $35,000 to $50,000, potentially increasing net profit per car 3-4 times.	1
	so with a luxury division, 6-8 times the profit per car and 3 times as many sold, is approximately 20 times the profit of just calling it a hyundai.	1
	corporations would rather not make 1/20 the profit that they should be making with a car, which is why hyundai is planning a luxury division.	1
	sterling is a worthless comparison, it was british and a rebadged rover v6 which had failed miserably in america a few years before, with terrible build quality (like all british/european cars) and feeble performance according to wiki.	1
	if jaguars and especially rovers don't sell, why would sterling?	1
	based on the excitement of a new brand, it still sold 15,000 its first year but was just a horrible car at the bottom of the jd power ratings and the specs couldn't compete.	1
	the genesis is the opposite, a fantastic car with unbelievable specs and performance for the price and guaranteed topnotch reliability.	1
	obviously lexus is a much better comparison, ls400 and genesis were/are both asian v8 rwd $35,000 cars that cost $20,000 less than the competition and from companies with top reliability scores, identical twins.	1
	mazda millenia, w8 passat, and phaeton, all got top reviews but failed miserably because nobody wanted to pay luxury prices for an economy brand, and hyundai's brand rep is even worse - bargain basement.	1
	hyundai has told advertisers to expect a new premium brand name before 2010.  sooner the better since the hyundai name has one of the worst reputations in america and a reputation for making cheap cars:                                 http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2007/04/new_luxury_bran.html                                '  april 03, 2007                new luxury brand name from hyundai?	1
	it seems that hyundai is serious about building a new premium brand to sell alongside its own marquee, reports noah joseph at autoblog.	1
	the recent introduction of the genesis concept car seems to be a sign of things to come.	1
	this, of course, is similar to toyota creating the premium lexus brand name expanding its brand architecture, just as nissan accomplished with infiniti and honda with acura.	1
	i think what we're really seeing here is the beginning of a shift in consumers' perceived quality of the hyundai brand.	1
	for some time, the hyundai name has lived on the fringe and was associated with economy.	1
	taking cues from the formula toyota and honda made successful, i think this is the right direction for hyundai.	1
	the difference?	1
	they're doing it much faster.	1
	hyundai is well aware that there are incredible challenges in its way.	1
	first of all, it seems as if hyundai has to give its dealers lessons in how to sell luxury cars as opposed to value cars.	1
	and an article in the washington post points out that hyundai has a long way to go in the u.s., where its cars are still considered cheap.'	1
	it also does not help that chung mong koo, the companys chairman, was caught embezzling the equivalent of $73.8 million from the company.	1
	nevertheless, hyundai has pitted its veracruz vs. the lexus rx350 and their overall product line keeps getting kudus for its quality, not least from jd power and associates, who ranked the brand third in the u.s. for overall quality.	1
	on the other hand, the same company put hyundai among the 7 car brand names (jaguar, jeep, hyundai, kia, land rover, saab and suzuki) with the worst reputations in the business among consumers last year.	1
	hyundai is the official vehicle of the 2010 soccer world cup in south africa and i can say with confidence that the advertisers there have been told to expect a new high-end premium brand name from hyundai.	1
	this will be a huge platform on which to launch a super-premium brand for hyundai.'	1
	and it was a speaker of several western languages that said on this thread that hyundai sounded unpleasant in all of them, and everyone can agree the smushed honda logo is ridiculous as well.	1
	a brand expert singled out hyundai for having perhaps the worst brand name in america and said it succeeded because of cheap prices despite it's dreadful name, until this year when its huge sales growth each year came to a complete halt like a ferrari enzo smashing into a brick wall.	1
	an ideal brand name like kia or genesis should have several of these characteristics: 1 short, 2 simple, 3 suggestive, 4, unique, 5 alliterative, 6 speakable, 7 spellable, 8 shocking, 9 personalized:                                 http://ries.typepad.com/ries_blog/2004/09/what_makes_a_go.html                                'the 9 keys to naming success.	1
	the single most important marketing decision a company can make it what to name a brand.	1
	a brands power lies in its ability to grab a position in the mind of the consumer.	1
	with a poor brand name you make the job of getting into the mind that much harder.	1
	with a great brand name you can help your brand down the road to success.	1
	its not that a brand with a poor name wont ever succeed.	1
	many do.	1
	if you price something cheap enough, it will move in spite of a dreadful name.	1
	hyundai, for example, sold 400,221 vehicles in the u.s. last year.	1
	but did you ever hear someone say, eat your heart out, i just got myself a 2004 hyundai?	1
	is hyundai a powerful brand?	1
	i think not.'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/244#msg244is hyundai a powerful brand?	1
	i think not.	1
	have to disagree with you thur.	1
	hyundai is a very powerful brand!	1
	everybody knows what a hyundai is.	1
	the brand is synonynmous with economy or low cost.	1
	they have built a strong brand, but now want to change the brand itself.	1
	i would not work to undo the last 2 decades of work, and start fresh with a new brand.	1
	unless you are saying you don't like your own brand, and you've wasted the last 2 decades.	1
	if you built one somewhat successful brand, why not build another one?	1
	wal-mart and neiman marcus aren't striking any marketing/location deals.	1
	i wonder why?	1
	this conundrum is not for the logical i suppose.	1
	maybe the board of directors have a female majority?	1
	if they're really serious about going luxury, than go luxury.	1
	don't be half-a%$.	1
	know your market.	1
	i drive a mini.	1
	i drive a mazda3.	1
	same price, big difference.	1
	americans are brand-conscious.	1
	don't fight it.	1
	accept it.	1
	be smart.	1
	you can't sell anything unless you know your market.	1
	don't bring up lexus if you won't learn from toyota.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/245#msg245re: is hyundai a powerful brand?	1
	i think not.	1
	[drfill]        no new name, just kia motors with the genesis division.	1
	kia is a much better name than hyundai and about as well known with more history as korea's first car company.	1
	hyundai sounds worse and has a cheap and bad reputation among americans.	1
	when datsun changed to nissan, it had record sales the 2 years after and there wasn't even anything wrong with datsun.	1
	hyundai and kia compete against each other by selling the same cars for the same narrow low price range.	1
	kia is not even the lower priced brand because a hyundai accent is the cheapest of either brand and a kia amanti is the same price as hyundai's current top sedan azera.	1
	excess models should be phased out to maximize profits and efficiency, then kia motors with the genesis division should be the name for the best cars that are left.	1
	gm and ford/mercury/lincoln are failing because they also have too many models within their own companies competing against each other.	1
	honda/acura, nissan/infiniti, and lexus/toyota/scion succeed because there are designated price points for each brand that don't overlap.	1
	scion is tiny and almost irrelevant, a 3rd cheaper brand would be unnecessary for kia/genesis.	1
	other successful car companies around the world don't have models competing against each other either.                        	1

	as for my plans, i believe i'll not wait the usual 10 years before buying another one, since i've been on the planet since 1936.  when the genesis appears, i'll give serious consideration to purchasing it, depending, of course, on how the present chariot holds up!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/247#msg247re: paisan [nycdc911]         the points in my posts that you failed to address is why you have no argument.	1
	i believe that i have addressed the relevant points that you made.	1
	and i should have said that instead of making 10 times as much money with a luxury brand, hyundai/genesis could make 20 times as much money as just calling it a hyundai.	1
	while they will make more money per car the fact is they will sell fewer cars.	1
	that's because mazda had to slash $4000 off the price of the millenia making it $32,000 and cutting net profit per car in half or less.	1
	of course the millenia was a lower valued car that was posing as a higher end car.	1
	the opposite appears to be true for the genesis.	1
	sterling is a worthless comparison,                                sterling is a perfect example.	1
	it was an attempt by one car company to start up a luxury brand.	1
	you keep bringing up history, this is part of history.	1
	just because a car company creates a luxury badge doesn't mean that it will sell.	1
	and sterling offered a lot for little money (at least in content, not sure on ride and handling since i never drove one).	1
	it seems you like to present history when it supports your position, but when historical evidence comes up that doesn't support your position it is worthless.	1
	go figure.	1
	mazda millenia, w8 passat, and phaeton,                                while you claim my comparison with sterling is worthless but you keep comparing the genesis with a vw that ran between 65-100k+.	1
	now thats a worthless comparison.	1
	not to mention the other examples.	1
	new luxury brand name from hyundai?	1
	i read the article and all it is is people guessing that hyundai is creating a luxury brand.	1
	do you have anything official from hyundai to say that they are creating a luxury brand.	1
	it basically is 'hyundai is coming out with the genesis so it                   seems                  like they are creating a luxury nameplate'.	1
	thats is just speculation.	1
	this, of course, is similar to toyota creating the premium lexus brand name                                except that we have nothing to go on but peoples speculation.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/248#msg248re: is hyundai a powerful brand?	1

	[nycdc911]         when datsun changed to nissan, it had record sales the 2 years after and there wasn't even anything wrong with datsun.	1
	the reason they changed names is that it was always nissan.	1
	they just picked a different name when they came into the us market in case they flopped.	1
	if they flopped datsun not nissan would be associated with the flop.	1
	when it turned out to be successful they went back to the original name.	1
	it was a pretty smart ideal overall.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/249#msg249hyundai: multiple billions in profits        guys, as much as you would like to spend hours and pages dissecting this companies decision and their next step into higher-end luxury automobiles, let's face something:                                fact: hyundai has passed very reputable companies like honda and nissan because of the vision and focus of their leadership to be a top-five automaker in the world.	1
	fact:  hyundai has determined that the best way to do this is to follow the blueprint of toyota.	1
	fact: hyundai has done it much faster than toyota.	1
	fact: toyota has requested access to hyundai plants!	1
	hmmm.	1
	(do you think toyota thinks hyundai is incompetent.	1
	i would guess they are very impressed and quite interested in learning something.	1
	ask the average car buyer if the above statement was a reality and most would laugh.	1
	most have no clue how much of a growing powerhouse this company is.	1
	fact:  most here just can't face hard facts that hyundai has overcome the past (perceived) issues and is in the upper echelon of car manufacterers.	1
	just look at an azera, veracruz, santa fe, sonata and you will see a company that easily competes with the top manufacturers.	1
	in a very short time hyundai will simply build very good luxury cars.	1
	fact:  the next generation will not have your bias and will simply see hyundai for who they are: a solid, reputable company that builds high-quality, very reliable cars.	1
	fact:  many of you have a biased predisposition against this company that doesn't allign with reality.	1
	hyundai is now #6 in the world.	1
	their recent success is based on a very detailed plan to reach the top five in sales and to do it by entering multiple segments.	1
	did you know that this plan was formulated just under a decade ago.	1
	they have faced numerous hurdles of late including the chung scandal and the korean won inflation.	1
	the separation from the hyundai group, the purchase and integration of kia and the expansion and integration of the 24/7 (7 new models in 24 mos) is complete.	1
	fact:  hyundai is a major player.	1
	ask gm's bob lutz who he fears.	1
	he didn't say 'toyota' because toyota hass already entered what demming said was the 'quality world' of consumers.	1
	toyota is now the premier automaker.	1
	but lutz understands and said he feared hyundai' because they are sitting at #6 with an incredible vision, the resources to continue to grow and a proven advancement in quality delivery.	1
	fact:  if you can't see what this company has accomplished and can't accept it, well, that is your limited understanding of the automotive big-picture.	1
	and we are all entitled to see what we want to see.	1
	but there is also reality and the reality is that hyundai is a worldwide automotive force, who even outsold honda and nissan.	1
	i would dare say the odds are with them as they advance into the luxury segment.	1
	fact: hyundai will never know if it can succeed unless it enters this segment.	1
	i suppose toyota would never have known either.	1
	we all know what happened there.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/250#msg250let's calm down a minute        before we make hyundai the second coming, can they build a best-in-class vehicle first?	1
	this genesis is far from a can't-miss, imo.	1
	in america, the only market that matters (along with china), hyundai is way behind honda and nissan in sales, or brand equity.	1
	and they haven't even started opening a luxury channel yet.	1
	count me as one of the people who doesn't see hyundai as a tier 1 manufacturer in the states.	1
	again, they've had 2-3 good years.	1
	working faster than toyota is no achievement!	1
	toyota takes there time, but they do it right.	1
	elantra has taken a step back.	1
	sonata is decent, but isn't scaring anyone.	1
	tucson is no threat to rav4 or crv.	1

	i see a lot of ambition, but not a whole lot of talent, yet.	1

	hyundai has proved a lot to me and as far as i am concerned they have proven themselves more than any other car i have had.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/253#msg253best in class?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/254#msg254oh and don't forget 1999        that is when hyundai introduced the now famoes 10 year and 5 year bumper to bumper that has literally changed the industry.	1
	oh and their were many naysayers then that said hyundai would go under.	1
	they went under alright.	1
	they ended up saving over $100 million dollars they had budget for warranty repairs because their claims came in even lower than they had predicted...why?	1
	their quality went thru the roof.	1
	when they introduced that warranty, which really brought out the haters, they were selling under 100,000 cars.	1
	this year they will sell over 500,000 and with kia over 800,000. so their vision and direction, even which was against what the 'experts' said, brought them at least a 400,000 more sales, billions in profits and, oh, they bought kia too.	1
	i think they have a good handle on this car building thing.	1

	hyundai has a fleet of marginal vehicles.	1
	nothing that any manufacturer worries about, or is threatened by.	1
	all they have going for them is low-cost production, and a big warranty.	1
	big deal!	1
	it would be one thing if they picked a segment, or better yet, created a segment, and said 'this is where we draw our line in the sand.	1
	this is our defining vehicle.	1
	this represents who we are.'	1
	and the vehicle actually made an impact on the market.	1
	hyundai doesn't have a vehicle like that.	1
	not even close, really.	1
	if they used nissan/infinit, or honda/acura products, they'd be better off, because they have a better argument, as these brands aren't setting the us on fire.	1
	can they build something that can be described as something more than 'decent' before ujsing lexus' and bmws names to make a sale?	1
	reeks of desperation.	1
	hell, it's something detroit has done to death, and to no avail.	1
	they make marginal vehicles, and are at the gm stages of rebuilding their quality reputation.	1
	now is not the time to swing for the fences.	1
	the lexus ls wasn't just cheaper than the $70k 750i or s420, it was clearly a better car.	1
	better made, better engine, better quality, more luxurious.	1
	better.	1
	hyundai is not doing anything on par with toyota, nissan or honda!	1
	so how do they open their mouths and even thing of saying bmw or lexus?	1
	you have to walk first.	1

	you know me as a loyal gm, fan but i can recognize a great car company when i see one.	1
	hyundai, has presented themselves as a automobile manufactor that makes damn great cars cheaper than the compeition.	1

	as a former engineer at ford, i looked at your tiering of companies and started laughing.	1
	gm, ford, and chrysler do not belong above honda.	1
	cadillac is a division of gm.	1
	chrysler is simply the worst car company that still sells cars in the u.s. - they would've gone out of business a while back if mercedes hadn't made the biggest mistake of their history bailing them out.	1
	make friends with a service manager at any chrysler dealer and they'll tell you what they really think of the cars they service.	1
	as for hyundai, they still have work to do on exterior design theme, dealer network, and public perception but there is no mistake they make solid vehicles approaching toyota and honda these days.	1
	gm is on their way back.	1

	well if they are not on par with toyota, nissan or honda then they must be exceeding them.	1
	i know more than one honda and toyota owner that are strongly considering a hyundai when it comes time to replace their cars.	1
	i know a few that already have.	1
	and the warranty tells me they still need a walking cane.	1
	how so?	1
	the warranty says a lot about how well they car is made and the willingness of the company to stand behind their product.	1
	you don't put a warranty like that out on something that is junk.       	1

	nothing to worry about from other manufacturers?	1
	toyota, gm, to name a few.	1
	the warranty has been and is a big deal for hyundai usa.	1
	since the implementation iirc in 98 was it?	1
	hyundai has been able to trim its repair costs by half, while increase its sale by more than 400% (don't recall the actual figure).	1

	well one way to look at it is lets say you wanted a bmw 545i and it costs $64k.	1
	lets say you bought a hyundai genesis 'ultimate' package for                $39k (probably a lil' high est.)	1
	that gives you $25,000 worth of gas just on price diference.	1

	i feel like a lexus walking into a hyundai commercial!	1
	i get no respect, i tell ya!	1
	points to ponder:                                1.  i don't troll.	1
	hyundai (and you guys) flippantly bring up toyota/lexus as points of reference.	1
	when this                 mistake                is made, i will be there, anywhere, to point this out.	1
	i go where duty calls.	1
	period.	1
	2.  hyundai sells a warranty, and a decent car to boot.	1
	outside of this forum, i haven't heard of any hyundai-worship.	1
	toyota camry and lexus ls aren't losing sales, or sleep, over a sonata or azera.	1
	tier 2 companies might have more to fear.	1
	3.  no one make crappy vehicles anymore.	1
	the days of the yugo, fiero, and fiesta are over.	1
	hyundai doesn't make crappy cars.	1
	they are decent.	1
	if they are something more than decent, they need better pr than some lexus/bmw ads to get that out there.	1
	this is the first i'm hearing of this late-breaking news!	1
	4.  if hyundai is so scary talented, than why doesn't toyota, or honda even, match their warranty?	1
	shouldn't they feel threatened?	1
	hyundai cars and trucks are just as good, right?	1
	just with a better warranty, and cheaper, right?	1
	so why doesn't anyone blink?	1
	5.  my tiers are based on sales, brand equity, and relative market significance.	1
	i damned cadillac because they are no better than infiniti or acura in they have no flagship.	1
	unless you consider the escalade a flagship.	1
	i don't.	1
	6.  it sounds like the bmw ad is the best of the three.	1
	if you are saying you have more features, more power, more, room, and a lower price, than you have a high-value ad.	1
	nobody is buying a veracruz for slalom times or whatever.	1
	and the lexus ad puts over the lexus as much as hypes the hyundai.	1
	it looks 3 times better, has a v8, and parks itself, plus has a tier 1 dealership behind it.	1
	that's the silliest commercial.	1
	i would buy a cx-9 over a veracruz in a minute.	1
	and so would edmunds.	1
	hyundai is selling a warranty, and seems to be unwilling to sells cars based on their own merit.	1
	they need other cars to make a case.	1
	which is fine.	1
	everyone needs a sales strategy.	1
	but i don't wanna hear toyota or lexus out of hyundai's mouth until they can generate their own buzz.	1
	that's my point.	1

	sales last year leveled off, even with many new products in the last 18 months.	1
	and sales this year are down.	1

	thats a good question.	1
	if toyota or honda are so reliable then it should be no issue to extend their warranty to match hyundais.	1

	perhaps you should read the article i posted in one of my earlier comments, if you hadn't already.	1
	thank you.	1

	yes sales are                 slightly                off in the first quarter 07 (us) but let's see why.	1
	by the way, kia sales are up fairly good amount compared to 1q last year but you seem to have left it out.	1
	anyway,                                1) new car sales are down overall through the end of the first quarter                                2) the unfortunate scandal and strikes have greatly affected production                                3) specifically, the accent and the elantra, while up, dealers across the us are still plagued by some serious supply issues.	1
	sonata is down because almost a year-long fleet initiative program ended recently (november 2006) to broaden the sonata and brand's appeal.	1
	numbers will be down compare to last year's as it shrinks such channel.	1
	azera has been performing well, with almost 90% of the limited trim being sold, and the shinning star presently seems to be the santa fe, which is an impressive product and possibly argued as one of the best in the class.	1
	twenty years ago, they might've been a stronger threat.	1
	there are many decent vehicles out there.	1
	they are just one of many.	1
	??	1
	20 years ago, hyundai just started doing business in the us.	1
	i don't think they can do it.	1
	it's that simple.	1
	they aren't toyota.	1
	i don't know if you are old enough but hyundai has become a force in the industry (you probably wouldn't want to admit such fact but that's the truth) faster than others such as toyota or honda.	1
	i firmly believe all three are great companies but i guess you probably would not.	1
	does hyundai has its issues to work out and improve upon?	1
	yes, and just like others, toyota, honda, ford, gm, etc.	1
	at the very least, you should give the credit hyundai deserves.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/296#msg296hyundai        taken from a forbes article...                                title:  how hyundai went from punch line to powerhouse--and is shaking up the world's auto industry.	1
	(says it all)                                last year hyundai's cars sprang to a virtual dead heat with quality leaders toyota and honda in j.d.	1
	power  associates' annual study of initial vehicle quality.	1
	the april consumer reports found the 2004 sonata the most reliable car on the road, with just two problems per 100 vehicles.	1
	(wow, sounds pretty clear to me coming from your beloved consumer reports)                                rivals aren't laughing anymore.	1
	in fact, hyundai is now dictating trends that others must follow.	1
	(a tiny country like korea doing all this, incredible)                                raised the safety bar for midsize sedans by including stability control, a feature it will make standard on all its vehicles.	1
	a month after the sonata's debut in detroit, gm announced it, too, would make stability control standard on all cars and trucks by 2010.	1
	(once again the u.s. is riding coat tails...)                                hyundai was the top seller in china in january and february, beating volkswagen and gm.	1
	(are you kidding me)                                'it's a company we must watch out for,' says honda chief executive takeo fukui.	1
	even toyota, widely considered the world's best automaker, is looking over its shoulder at the koreans.	1
	says toyota president fujio cho: 'we will watch them more carefully than in the past and try not to be overwhelmed by them.'	1
	( i think i read someone on this post saying these companies were not worried aout hyundai, who could that have been?)	1
	for u.s. automakers hyundai's rise is like a rerun of a bad movie.	1
	'to some extent they are doing what the japanese did before them, but on a faster track,' says dieter zetsche, chief of chrysler.	1
	( a faster track?	1
	heard that here somewhere and someone questioned that, well here is your answer)                                the nonunion wage rate in alabama is $14 per hour to start, rising to $21 in two years, versus $7 in korea.	1
	(there is your problem with u.s. factories)                                to other automakers hyundai is looking like the party guest who won't go home.	1

	a common question is: 'is this the car that parks itself?'	1
	lexus likes when the feature is associated with the ls.	1
	this is a good thing!	1

	in a year!	1
	i called it a sales plateau.	1
	am i wrong, or is hyundai sandbagging about 20k deals?	1
	let's remind the people:                 sales are down this year                , more than 60 deals.	1
	and my funky #2:  what am i supposed to admit?	1
	they've had 2-3 good years, as far as quality awards and such.	1
	this just gets them up to average, because they still have to live down the previuos decade.	1
	just like gm.	1
	gm has had some nice awards for a couple of years to.	1
	i guess toyota and honda can just go home.	1
	their reps mean nothing.	1
	if i want quality, i better, run, don't walk, and get a cobalt or elantra?	1
	honda and toyota have been leading for decades.	1
	they aren't having a good week in the business.	1
	and if i'm gonna invest in a company that is gonna have a good 2-3 year run, why would i go to hyundai and not gm?	1
	i'd buy american, no doubt.	1
	hyundai has to be better, just to get in the game.	1
	they aren't better.	1
	unless you have low expectations, besides a big warranty.	1
	edmunds said santa fe is #3 in it's class behind rav4 and cx-7, and cr-v wasn't included.	1
	the santa fe is supposed to be some big deal, right?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/300#msg300re: joe [drfill]        you just don't get it.	1
	do you?	1
	on a side note, the lexus self-parking feature is great and all but then you have the touran which can self-park much faster than the ls, and you can even maneuver the steering wheel in the process.	1
	i've tested the ls parking feature, it worked such a hassle.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/301#msg301re: tough crowd, tough crowd.	1
	[drfill]         hyundai sells a warranty, and a decent car to boot.	1
	outside of this forum, i haven't heard of any hyundai-worship.	1
	toyota camry and lexus ls aren't losing sales, or sleep, over a sonata or azera.	1
	tier 2 companies might have more to fear.	1
	i don't agree, at least anymore.	1
	they offered the warranty to get people to give them a try.	1
	i'll bet their warranty shrinks shortly, especially since their cars are becoming more advanced and more loaded with features (read: more expensive to fix).	1
	people are starting to trust them again, and rightly so.	1
	3. no one make crappy vehicles anymore.	1
	the days of the yugo, fiero, and fiesta are over.	1
	hyundai doesn't make crappy cars.	1
	they are decent.	1
	if they are something more than decent, they need better pr than some lexus/bmw ads to get that out there.	1
	this is the first i'm hearing of this late-breaking news!	1
	i don't entirely agree with this, either.	1
	while cars have gotten better across the board, there are still cars that i would call crap.	1
	ford suv's bursting into flames for example.	1
	most volkwagons and mercedes post warranty.	1
	but i don't wanna hear toyota or lexus out of hyundai's mouth until they can generate their own buzz.	1
	that's my point.	1
	actually, hyundai is generating buzz.	1
	it's not the 'best in class' buzz that the teir 1 makes get, but that's not what hyundai is aiming for.	1
	what they're aiming for, and hitting, is the 'good-god this car has a lot of features for the money' buzz.	1
	i would buy a cx-9 over a veracruz in a minute.	1
	and so would edmunds                                so would i if they were priced the same and had the same features.	1
	where hyundai is getting their sales is by offering a car that's 95% (and growing) of the competitor in terms of refinement at thousands less, with more features, and a 10 year warranty.	1
	they won't (and don't) appeal to the car junkies for who that 5% makes a world of difference, but they will (and do) appeal to people who just want a generic car of a particular type.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/302#msg302re: joe [drfill]        they show the car parking itself, which is one of it's defining, most-sought after features.	1
	i can think of few features of technology that are less useless to 99.9% of the population than being able to park yourself.	1
	think how many times you have parallel parked in the last 5 years.	1
	in my case i might have parallel parked 1 times where i had to back in between two cars.	1
	otherwise it's zip over to the curb in front of the post office and put 'er in park.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/303#msg303re: jim [drfill]         my advice: attack the cadillacs, acuras, and infinitis of the world.	1
	keep bmw and lexus out of your mouths.	1
	are you talking rwd sports sedans?	1
	then infiniti is better than lexus.	1
	when gs and m came out, gs outsold m by quite a margin, but now m has caught and passes gs by quite a margin.	1
	g also is outselling is by quite a margin each month (check the figures for march).	1
	last year g coupe outsold 3 coupe by 2:1 ratio!	1
	if we talk rwd luxury sports sedans alone (excluding suvs and heavy luxury sedans), bmw and infiniti are one-two.	1
	hyundai is a formidable competitor in china, india and, i guess, much of the developing world.	1
	but hyundai hasn't repeated the success of toyota/honda in the us.	1
	in the developing world, most cars are bare bone, one notch above the yugo, almost none are rwd v8 luxury cars.       	1

	am i wrong, or is hyundai sandbagging about 20k deals?	1
	clearly you must have been in a cave and forgotten the whole scandal ordeal and numerous strikes, which greatly affected its production output.	1
	fwiw, hyundai usa has rose its sales at more than 400% over the past decade or so.	1
	let's remind the people: sales are down this year, more than 60 deals.	1
	see my previous post, and only by a small amount of units.	1
	so far the decrease is the story for much of the industry.	1
	new car sales just aren't picking up their pace as they have been in the past.	1
	they've had 2-3 good years, as far as quality awards and such.	1
	you should really do some research before you post.	1
	honda and toyota have been leading for decades.	1
	you're probably too young to recall back in the days honda and toyota in the position of hyundai's.	1
	back then, no one gave a look to them, and they were proven wrong.	1
	hyundai's got a really good shot replicating such result, with even faster pace, and you sound exactly like the naysayers of the old days who passed on the japanese.	1

	the santa fe is supposed to be some big deal, right?	1
	all hail edmunds then since they've got the final say in everything, right?	1
	after having had the opportunity, and with extensive time in these three cuvs, they were all terrific product, and i wouldn't mind having any of the three - it comes down to personal taste and preference.	1
	while all three shined, santa fe came down for me as the overall winner.	1
	the layout, features, build quality, and driving experience - exceptional, along with its practicability, a powerful 3.3 engine and quite cabin, the sf didn't just do well in one area, it did well in most areas.	1

	but as hyundai is (as i recall reading a while back) the world's sixth largest manufacturer of vehicles, and intends to be the world's fifth largest by 2010, i'd suggest that the movers and shakers of that particular division are likely aware of both their current place and their current direction (their 'dreams' as you have it) and are very likely to have a strong and well-thought-out business model which is sufficiently flexible to accomplish that goal... or dream...        	1

	http://members.forbes.com/global/2005/0425/024.html                                read the article for what it is, not the negatives you always seem to see.	1
	the title says it all.	1
	it also has quotes from honda and toyota leaders putting at least one of your comments about toyota and honda not being worried to rest.	1
	hyundai is sensible and educated people in todays society understand sensible cars.	1
	i am guessing you are one of those people who would buy a car just for your perceived social status, just to impress, just in case i lost you.	1
	hyundai is, with all you get including price and warranty, as even with those other vehicles you mention to any rational person who isn't worried about a badge or status symbol.	1
	i own a lexus, a top of the line lexus, and it is a fantastic vehicle in every sense.	1
	i also own an azera, it to is a fantastic vehicle in every sense and it cost 55k less than the lexus.	1
	i sure am having a great time with the money i saved on my 2nd car....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/316#msg316facts        hyudai can play with the big boys.	1
	what makes me think like that?	1
	in 2006,                                1. hyundai became the 6th largest automobile company in the world in                 40 years!!	1
	(beating honda and nissan as well).	1
	2. hyundai was 3rd place in jd-power initial quality.	1
	1st and 2nd was porsche and lexus meaning that hyudai was 1st place in non-luxury brand.	1
	guess who was the 4th?	1
	toyota!	1
	right..                 toyota!	1
	3. according to fortune, hyundai was 80th in top 100 companies in the world.	1
	- can these be some 'accomplishment' ?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/317#msg317agent 81        i love it when you agree with me.	1
	such rapport!	1
	what do all of those things have in common?	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/318#msg318jimmy                        well, you own a lexus, so you have some credibility, you're not just a shill.	1
	good job on that!	1
	i'll overlook your snide comment, and let you know how i choose cars.	1
	i buy what i like.	1
	that's it.	1
	and it doesn't hurt if it's made by the best comapnies on earth, or better yet, in america.	1
	and edmunds' opinion generally coincide with my own.	1
	that helps.	1
	works for me oh so nicely.	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/319#msg319re: joe [drfill]         show me something where hyundai is 'running with the big boys', beside a couple of good test scores over the last 2-3 years.	1
	you're now really just arguing semantics now.	1
	read the industry reviews, read the quotes from top execs, just go read something.	1
	anyone who knows a little about the auto industry is aware of the fact hyundai being a formidable brand to be reckoned with, and for years to come.	1
	i don't know but somehow you've been feeding info most of us aren't getting.	1
	they sell less than 500k a year with 7 vehicles?	1
	and toyota sells more than 26 vehicles in the us, you point?	1
	now drop the warranty                                we went through this before - the warranty is above and beyond just a marketing ploy.	1
	for one, i would never suggest any automaker to drop its warranty program just to prove something, regardless how wonderful its products are.	1
	it's crazy to even suggest something like this.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/320#msg320re: jimmy [drfill]         well, you own a lexus, so you have some credibility, you're not just a shill.	1
	good job on that!	1
	there you go boys and girls - you heard it here first.	1
	that's just great logic on your part - you are really showing your fanboy status now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/321#msg321re: agent 81 [drfill]        i posted those facts because i thought those might help you understand that hyudai can play with the big boys.	1
	i guess it didn't work        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/322#msg322joe                        toyota doesn't sell 26 vehicles.	1
	toyota, lexus, and scion do, collectively.	1
	that's not what we're talking about.	1
	staying on topic helps.	1
	the point is hyundai makes these great cars, has better prices, has this huge warranty, and they still struggle.	1
	why?	1
	so now warranty is a marketing ploy?	1
	kinda like 0% financing?	1
	ford gives their cars away too.	1
	should i be impressed by them?	1
	aren't they bringing up successful vehicles (certainly not made by ford) in ads to sell one of their sleds as well?	1
	maybe toyota/honda should learn from these incredible marques on how to sell cars?	1
	big warranties.	1
	give them away.	1
	nice.	1
	desperate times....                                good night all.	1

	i see an uneducated person trying to sound educated...                                i doubt you have owned or driven most of the vehicles you refer to beyond maybe a test drive.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/326#msg326re: now that was mean, jim [drfill]         poke holes in those two for me.	1
	see there is your problem                .	1
	you insist on picking up unnecessary fights and posting inaccurate info trying to somehow discredit others.	1
	the mini and the 3 are great small cars but that's not what we are discussing, back to the bh please.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/329#msg329re: now that was mean, jim [jimsinkorea]                        jim, what do you think they're gonna say?	1
	hyundai ain't worth a damn?	1
	toyota and honda know if they do what they do best, hyundai is not a threat, at least to them.	1
	if honda or toyota really cared, they would lower prices, or raise their warranties.	1
	that ain't happening.	1
	my point is conisitent.	1
	gm can barely bring up toyota without looking bad.	1
	where does hyundai get off saying anything about bmw or lexus?	1
	what have they done to get in the ring with the best?	1
	a couple of nice articles and surveys ain't getting it done.	1
	this genesis will have to be chrysler 300 and lexus ls all in one, and with a dealership to match the hype.	1
	just letting you know, you might not wanna bet the farm just yet.	1
	they seem to be having a full plate keeping hyundai growing.	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/330#msg330re: now that was mean, jim [drfill]         toyota and honda know if they do what they do best, hyundai is not a threat, at least to them.	1
	if honda or toyota really cared, they would lower prices, or raise their warranties.	1
	that ain't happening.	1
	i'd put a big 'yet' at the end of both these statements.	1
	right now hyundai vehicles are close, but not quite there in comparison to honda and toyota.	1
	but for the last several years they've consistently come out with products that were much better than anyone would have believed they were capable of.	1
	at the rate their going, toyota and honda will be lowering prices or extending warranties in another 5 to 10 years.	1
	one could also compare the situation to detroit vs honda and toyota in the 70's.	1
	perhaps honda and toyota will coast on their reputation and loyal buyers only to wake up one day and find they're in real trouble.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/331#msg331auto-parking          agreed.	1
	only required in certain major cities (e.g.	1
	nyc) and downtown areas of smaller towns.	1
	the ls self-parks in about 73 seconds, when works - that's almost a minute and 15 seconds!!	1
	the system is not as easy as it looks - after a few tries, i finally got it to work.	1
	the times when it failed, the car keeps backing into the direction of other parked cars despite everything programed correctly.	1
	it was a good thing i was in a parking lot because at some major city streets, i would be honked so many times if i took that long to park, even at 73 seconds.	1
	good luck using this system in nyc!	1
	i parrallel park in manhattan daily and there is no way the lexus system could shoe-horn itself into 90% of the parking spots here!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/332#msg332re: joe [drfill]         give me one inaccuracy.	1
	just one.	1
	i will give you several.	1
	1) your so-called tier groups                                2) hyundai not being a threat to other automakers (google hyundai threat to toyota, as an example); and not being able to 'run with the big boys'                                3) related: hyundai just treading water, and nothing more; and then you said its success was only shown the past two to three years                                also, your biased opinions - hyundai having marginal vehicles, which probably means you haven't even tested any of its fleet, or even better, someone who owns a lexus has credibility for posting here.	1
	plus your stubbornness, failing to factor issues such as scandal, strikes, stronger currency, which mitigated some of the momentum; failing to understand the point of those ads, yet continue to arguing against the facts after information was provided to you; no automakers are invisible, including toyota and honda (e.g.	1
	large amount of recalls; subsidized lease deals and lower aprs, tundra and prius come to mind)       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/333#msg333hard to believe, but.....        a new day, and nothing posted yet from                 drfill??	1
	things are looking up!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/334#msg334who dares rub aladdin's lamp?	1
	joey, babe.	1
	listen.	1
	a.  my tiers are my opinion, and you have yet to show these can be refutable.	1
	if you can show how hyundai is anything higher than 3rd tier, go right ahead.	1
	be my guest.	1
	but you need sales volume to get to tier 1, and most in tier 2 out-produce hyundai, and have some brand equity to speak of.	1
	i'll cut you a deal.	1
	if hyundai, with kia, even though we aren't talking about kia, can get 5% of the market, you can go to 2nd tier.	1
	fair enough?	1
	b.  how is hyundai a threat to 'yota?	1
	honda?	1
	explain.	1
	you haven't done that yet.	1
	getting some lip service when a reporter asks a question doesn't prove anything.	1
	show how toyota or honda have changed to accomodate this new challenger.	1
	do people want a hyundai, honestly?	1
	i know many who want honda or toyota.	1
	that's why sales for them are up, not flat.	1
	c.  sales have leveled-off, and i have proven that.	1
	and new models haven't spurred sales.	1
	that's textbook tread ware.	1
	even new tires isn't helping!	1
	i've provided just as many facts, and you have been as stubborn, if not more.	1
	i call a spade a spade.	1
	toyota is on top.	1
	honda and nissan secure the 2nd level, and hyundai is climbing, but obviously is starting to have trouble.	1
	let's bring in bmw and lexus for some help.	1
	help!	1

	the title of this article is 'hyundai 2007 march sets record sales'...                                umm, that seems pretty good to me.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/343#msg343i just read evcery post in this thread....        from start to finish in one sitting.	1
	of course i am supposed to be working and my boss is paying me to read, but i did it anyway and am proud...                                ok, first of all i am a mortgage broker and make 6 figures a year.	1
	guess what i drive?	1
	a 2004 hyundai sonata.	1
	my wife drives a 2006 hyundai santa fe.	1
	could i afford a nicer car?	1
	of course.	1
	but i love the cars that i drive.	1
	no complaints from me.	1
	i have owned a 1987 hyundai excel (my first new car ever) that was a hatch back base model with the only option being a cassette radio.	1
	no a/c and i live in phoenix, az.	1
	the car sucked, but i kept it with minor repairs for 164,000 miles.	1
	my gf at the time wrecked it when she went out for ice cream.	1
	my insurance company gave me $1650 for it as a pay off.	1
	i owned a 2002 hyundai santa fe that my wife drove until she hit 86,000.  the only problem we ever had was some wind noise which the company fixed at no cost, and they replaced the gas cap as it was causing the check engine light to come on.	1
	before we traded that in i bought my 2004 sonata which i love.	1
	i have had no issues at all with it and currently have 78,000 miles on it.	1
	about 6 months ago i traded in the 2002 for a 2006 santa fe.	1
	my wife loves that car.	1
	no issues with it and almost 20,000 miles.	1
	i had looked last week at the azera, but i am going this week to check out the veracruz.	1
	i will see which i like better after the test drive and of course that is what we will get.	1
	btw, we are proud to tell people that we are a 'hyundai family'.	1
	yes, i can afford a bmw or lexus.	1
	i like knowing that i drive a car that i truly love and that i did not spend that much money for.	1
	i cannot wait until this genesis comes out.	1
	i can almost guarantee that i will be driving one.	1
	also, when you read reviews of hyundai products on edmunds, have you ever noticed how many of the people that posted owned a hyundai and bought a new one?	1
	it is amazing.	1
	hyundai owners have a very strong loyalty to the brand.	1
	have a good day.       	1

	is it that you think that they are the best cars on the road, or that you choose to buy other things or save your money?	1
	do you think that hyundai is the best automaker?	1
	do you believe that the genesis, if and when it is introduced, will be the best high performance luxury car on the road?       	1

	lol.....well i'm glad i impress you.	1
	i look at it this way pal, if hyundai can pay union workers who make the uaw look like pussy cats a gold package wage and benefits which i support then by golly they should be applauded.	1
	they don't have 'greed' in their corporate philosophy and the pie is sliced fairly and the workers do their part to make sure the car is screwed togeather properly.	1
	hyundai, has learned to engineer a awesome automobile like the genesis.	1
	the car isn't marked up several thousands because of a emblem thus we the customer get the best 'value' going                today in the auto-industry.	1
	although i agree with you in theory, i will have to disagree with you from the business perspective.	1
	well i never said bringing a emblem aka 'luxury brand' to the market would be a bad long-term solution.	1
	i guess it's worth risking even though i personally might wait a few more years.	1
	i however would still consider the genesis, as a next car if it still gave me the 'value' part.	1
	i don't need them to mark the car up several thousands because of the emblem like other luxury brands.	1
	if they wanted to charge me a few more bucks for some extra perks or added technology i'd still buy it.	1
	it's sad to say, but people who live in america are image concious and would not be caught driving a hondai(the way they pronounce it).	1
	i'm not saying that's cool.	1
	i'm just saying that's the way it is.	1
	-agree.....however their would still be several buyers if hyundai, keeps the genesis, a                 hondai                                 it may cost more to make new emblems and build a seperate division, but it would be more successful in the long run.	1
	yes, the long-term benefit would yield good future numbers for the company.	1
	it would certainly open new doors for hyundai.	1
	in the beginning they should expect to lose money or stay flat with profits.	1
	then once they develop a fan base they can start to make some hefty profits while undercutting their competition.	1
	i think a new luxury division would be hott !!!!	1
	if they can get people to try the products out they might just take over lexus, in the luxury car spot.	1
	why ?	1
	'value' !!!!	1
	that was the winning formula for lexus                                 they should do to the luxury segment what they have done to the lower/middle segment.	1
	agree....acura, is a value leader but they didn't mix the right formula with the acura rl.	1
	the rl, didn't have the right hardware (v8) to fight off it's competition.	1
	the genesis, will easily take out the rl, unless acura, gets their crap togeather quickly.	1
	appreciate you're input rocky.	1
	no problem dan.	1

	money is always an issue, no matter how much of it you have.	1
	besides there is always a more expensive, better riding, or driving car, no matter what car you own.	1

	a 2004 hyundai sonata.	1
	my wife drives a 2006 hyundai santa fe.	1
	could i afford a nicer car?	1
	of course.	1
	but i love the cars that i drive.	1
	no complaints from me.	1
	i have owned a 1987 hyundai excel (my first new car ever) that was a hatch back base model with the only option being a cassette radio.	1
	no a/c and i live in phoenix, az.	1
	the car sucked, but i kept it with minor repairs for 164,000 miles.	1
	my gf at the time wrecked it when she went out for ice cream.	1
	my insurance company gave me $1650 for it as a pay off.	1
	i owned a 2002 hyundai santa fe that my wife drove until she hit 86,000.  the only problem we ever had was some wind noise which the company fixed at no cost, and they replaced the gas cap as it was causing the check engine light to come on.	1
	before we traded that in i bought my 2004 sonata which i love.	1
	i have had no issues at all with it and currently have 78,000 miles on it.	1
	about 6 months ago i traded in the 2002 for a 2006 santa fe.	1
	my wife loves that car.	1
	no issues with it and almost 20,000 miles.	1
	i had looked last week at the azera, but i am going this week to check out the veracruz.	1
	i will see which i like better after the test drive and of course that is what we will get.	1
	btw, we are proud to tell people that we are a 'hyundai family'.	1
	yes, i can afford a bmw or lexus.	1
	i like knowing that i drive a car that i truly love and that i did not spend that much money for.	1
	i cannot wait until this genesis comes out.	1
	i can almost guarantee that i will be driving one.	1
	also, when you read reviews of hyundai products on edmunds, have you ever noticed how many of the people that posted owned a hyundai and bought a new one?	1
	it is amazing.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/376#msg376re: i just read evcery post in this thread.... [floridabob1]        to be honest, yes, i think there are better cars out there.	1
	i am a bmw fan.	1
	the issue though is not if i drive the best car out there.	1
	what matters to me is if i drive the best car for what i am willing to spend.	1
	i am not worried about a status symbol.	1
	i am happy to drive a car that i am very happy with and know that i am able to do what i want with the money i did not spend.	1
	in my household there is only myself and my beautiful wife.	1
	while i could go out and buy a 5000 sq ft home in scottsdale, i instead bought a 1350 sq ft home in el mirage.	1
	not because i had to, but because the home i bought was a good value, suited my needs, and made me happy.	1
	my car is the same way.	1
	as a mortgage broker i have picked up clients and taken them to sign documents in my sonata.	1
	never once have i been embarrassed to take them in my car for fear of what they might think of me.	1
	i have even laughed quietly to myself when others have told me it was a nice car and asked 'what is it?'.	1
	i laugh when they change expressions when i tell them it is a hyundai.	1
	so again, yes, for $1000's more i could buy a 'better' car.	1
	but when you figure a car is only a little better, but costs a lot more, the hyundai makes perfect sense.       	1

	let's put it this way....                                i got a sizeable bonus this year from work.	1
	i had a choice, i could have bought let's say for example an m5 bmw with the money from that, free and clear.	1
	i opted not to buy that and instead purchased a slightly used subaru legacy 5mt gt wagon and a cigarette boat.	1
	i'm going to have a lot more fun on the track keeping up 85% of the time with the m5, and in addition, out on the water in my 850hp boat doing 75-80mph on the water.	1
	so it's choices, if one feels they want the bmw great, but the genesis will give people the option to not drop all that cash and still get a well performing luxury car and have some coin left over for a boat, a vacation, or whatever they want to have 'fun' doing.	1

	i got re-married a few years ago and ended up with a total of 4 kids in our household.	1

	along the same line, even 'overall value' is highly subjective.	1
	as a kid just starting out to drive, the 1998 dodge stratus that my younger step son drives has so far proven to be a great value.	1
	cheap to get, fully loaded, decent gas mileage, no repairs, drives nice, and the kid loves it.	1

	for some it will not, might not, could not, for whatever reasons.	1
	and i am still waffling if i should go out and get a new car (and the azera might be one of the candidates) this year or should i wait for the genesis...and if isn't the value i am looking for then, i can always go for an azera at that time...       	1

	no way hyundai customers are going to buy hyundai's stated modest yearly goal of 20,000 genesis cars that costs $10,000 more, maybe half that at best.	1
	compare that to toyota's avalon selling 7000 a month, and camry selling 40,000 a month.	1
	and the all new veracruz which is priced up to $38,000 with options but has gotten good reviews as a budget alternative to the lexus rx350 only sold 178 cars in march!!	1
	obviously like i said, nobody wants to pay $30,000 or more for a hyundai, very few even want to pay $25,000.	1
	hyundai needs to start a genesis luxury division like toyota did with the lexus ls400, a rwd v8 $35,000 luxury sedan for $20,000 less than the competition, which is exactly the same as the genesis sedan.	1
	mazda's millenia, vw's w8 passat and phaeton, and even hyundai's own azera and veracruz are examples of cars that bombed because they tried to sell an economy brand car at a luxury price.	1
	mazda had to cut $4000 off the price of a millenia to $32,000 4 years after its intro and sales still sucked and they had to drop the car.	1
	lexus' ls400 went from $35,000 to $50,000 in 5 years with huge sales.	1
	hyundai by starting a new genesis luxury brand would sell 3 times as many cars (15,000 to lux owners and 15,000 to econonmy owners as opposed to just 10,000 to economy owners) and make 6-8 times as much per car, as opposed to calling it a hyundai.	1
	that's 20 times as much money for the 1 genesis car alone, in addition to increased brand/company prestige and increased sales through the entire hyundai/kia line just like toyota experienced after launching lexus.       	1

	1) azera - a modest gain so far; what you didn't realize last year's figures included sales of the outgoing xg                                azera is a new (first generation) and unknown model, with few advertising spots in between...                                sales could have been better, with some much needed ad spots, which hyundai is currently picking up...the demographics have been purchasing high-end trims, north of 30k msrp, so if i was you, i would defn.	1
	re-think your theory.	1
	2) veracruz - the cuv just came out during mid-late march period (depending on dealer allocations), and your sweeping generalization - it's tanking already - oh wow...                                most who have test driven either of these two cars will tell you how good they are.	1
	those having doubts they are not on par with the rest of the class, well, it's time to head out to your local dealership and test drive them.	1
	i'd bet you will be impressed.	1
	and, i hope you do realize hyundai, just like other automakers, are in this business to make $$$, so forget about offering these products with excel pricing.	1
	fwiw, hyundai still carries a very appealing feature-to-price advantage (value) over its competitors.	1
	while such advantage has shrunk somewhat in the past few years, mainly due to increased local currency, with the combination of lower prices from competitors (plus favorable currency rates), justifiable factors include the quality of its products...                                 hyundai needs to start a genesis luxury division                                again, we went over this already.	1
	a luxury division does not generate instant success, at least not with the logic you have been feeding.	1
	there is no guarantee having a luxury division will have the enough benefit to offset added costs, which can be quite a bit.	1
	i am reading hyundai is currently  exploring the possibility of a luxury division but the bh, when it hits production next year, will wear a hyundai badge.	1
	so all these talks about the supposed feasibility of a luxury division, well, is speculation, at best.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/404#msg404re: azera, veracruz sales tanking [nycdc911]         hyundai sold less than 6000 azeras from jan-mar 2007, behind last year's pace which was disappointing.	1
	over 7000 avalons and 40,000 camry's were sold in march alone.	1
	sonata                10k/month is about 1/4 of camry sales                sounds about right to me with the azera being 1/4 of avalon's sales.	1
	this edmunds forum started a buying experience forum for the veracruz on 3/20 and people immediately started posting so it's been available at least since then.	1
	even if it went on sale that day that means it was on pace for only 500 units in the first month!	1
	plus while the dealers tried in vain to start at msrp, fitzmall is already offering it for just $500 over invoice and others buying it for even less.	1
	expect prices way below invoice very soon, another crash and burn disaster from hyundai trying to sell a $38,000 car with their brand name and badge.	1
	trust me when i say this, by the end of the march, there were a good amount of hyundai dealers having only one allocation, and most were using to demo.	1
	how did i know this?	1
	i work for a pr firm, and i have certain information that are not generally released to the public.	1
	you're calling this a disaster by reading a few days of sale and what i would think your biased perception?	1
	we have a winner here...                                if you basing everything on sales figures, then you are defn.	1
	looking at these issues and possibly others from the wrong angle.	1
	starting a genesis luxury division is a no brainer, with the failures of the millenia, w8 passat, phaeton, azera, veracruz, vs. the success of lexus, acura, infiniti, how many more examples do they need?	1
	azera/veracruz failures?	1
	news to me.	1
	lexus/acura/infiniti have been mostly success as nameplates, but certainly there were unsuccessful models within, just like every other company.	1
	you go through good cycles and bad.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/405#msg405i will be first in line...        i own a 2002 sonata and a 2002 santa fe.	1
	i bought them because they were what i liked, cross shopped with honda and toyota, would pick hyundai even if prices were the same.	1
	i am a big fan of hyundai, love cheering for the underdog.	1
	i, for one, can't wait to test drive the new genesis.	1
	hyundai continues to surprise most, but i knew what hyundai was capable of when i first test drove the updated sonata back in 1999.  they have their sights set on toyota, in my mind they have already passed them...       	1

	enjoy......                                 [rant]                i've asked this before, and i'll ask it again of every single person who brings up 'uaw/american made' in a car discussion.	1
	where are your clothes made?	1
	how much did they cost?	1
	who made them?	1
	i'll bet that 95% of the folks who are on the 'american made' car stuff are wearing clothes made in some sweatshop in se asia or other 3rd world country.	1
	that is how you are able to buy clothes so inexpensively at walmart, etc.	1
	why is it then not ok to make a major purchase like a car from the same sources?	1
	my ancestors were in the clothing and garment business, they lost their jobs because they couldn't compete with the low labor costs overseas, guess what?	1
	they adapted, changed and got different jobs.	1
	they didn't ask for us to subsidize(sp?)	1
	the jobs an blindly support their higher wages.	1
	so i reject anyone's arguements about 'american content' and 'american labor' unless he or she is living completely on american goods, and this includes the gas you put in your said 'american made' car etc.	1
	sorry but that doesn't hold water in my book to pick and choose what you are 'patriotic' about, of course you are free to do as you choose in this country but you can't start throwing stones if you live in a glass house!	1

	it'll get a 6 or more speed at although not sure if it'll be out of the veracruz, is that fwd or rwd based?	1
	-mike       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/424#msg424re: i love this car and it's possibility's....... [paisan]        the veracruz is either fwd or awd.	1
	so i am not to sure i it will be the veracruz tranny, but it most likely be a 6 speed auto i doubt if it will be more than that (in reality a six speed auto is borderline over kill).	1
	when cadillac came out with the cts it was a mt and the v series is only available in a mt.	1
	i think hyundai would be smart to follow that and have it in a manual.	1
	but since all mt hyundais (sonata and above) have a shiftable auto transmission there will be some that would say offering a mt is not needed.	1
	i say not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/425#msg425re: i love this car and it's possibility's....... [snakeweasel]        auto-shift is nothing like an mt.	1
	it's really a hoky cutsy way of choosing what gear is electronically chosen by the tcu.	1
	any car with an auto-trans can be 'tiptronically, autosticked' or otherwise shifted in the same manner.	1
	all it does is 'suggest' to the tcu what gear the car should be in.	1
	i think they should definitely take the 5 series and cts path and have an optional mt for these vehicles.	1
	would probably sway me more toward considering the purchase if they did and would show that they are serious about performance luxury rather than just another full-size car.	1
	-mike       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/426#msg426re: i love this car and it's possibility's....... [paisan]        i fully agree with what you said.	1
	however my understanding is that the shiftable manuals will always go into the gear you 'suggest' unless it produces a rpm that is to high or to low.	1
	iow as long as the engine is not red lining or at a stall speed it will be in the gear you select.	1
	yet it is nothing like a mt.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/427#msg427re: i love this car and it's possibility's....... [snakeweasel]        depends on the implementation of the tcu programming.	1
	for instance, in my old svx, when i tracked it i ran the at in '2' or '1' once you hit redline, it would automatically upshift to the next highest gear.	1
	once in the higher gear, if you slowed enough that it would not be past redline when going to the lower gear it would downshift automatically.	1
	this setup of all the automatics i've driven on-track, is the most ideal.	1
	essentially providing perfect shifting each time.	1
	i would be coming down the front straight at limerock park in 3rd gear with the selector in '2' as soon as i started to brake near just before the bridge, it would shift down to 2nd gear and apply engine braking perfectly.	1
	some systems despite what gear you select will put you in what it feels it should be in, although when in 'manual' mode it is a bit more agressive, holding you at redline longer.	1
	i played with the setup on my mom's optima, it was cool but like the other manumatics, could never really get comfy with it and just kept it in d.                                -mike                motorsports and tuning host       	1

	these people were appointed by the uaw leadership without reagard to their capabilities.	1
	i inherited this role in a job change and these 'reps' were meeting with my customer service reps every friday.	1
	they were crude, rude and cared little for their fellow employees.	1
	they spent most of their time hitting on the female customer service reps. i heard things like 'sit on my f!	1
	#' and worse.	1
	i had to immediately go to corporate counsel because they were opening my company and theirs to eeo suits.	1
	my uncle worked on the corvette line until he retired and could not stand to be around his non corvette 'union brothers'.	1
	he witnessed them stealing tools, putting rivets into heater hoses and much more.	1
	as far as benefits the uaw wanted everthing in beneftis along with high salaries for unskilled labor.	1
	that helped destroy the us automobile industry.	1
	i was called to detroit to be 'verbally whipped' by the head office but after they learned of the eeo ramifications they changed their demeanor right away.	1
	are all uaw workers like this?	1
	certainly not.	1
	in my location the chrsler and ford reps were capable men qualified to do their representative jobs and there were no sexual inuendos.	1
	i was threatened by on of the gm reps and on one occasion he tried to punch me in the lobby of my building.	1
	he was so drunk i simply ducked and he fell on the brick floor and knocked himself out.	1
	in any event, the uaw leadership let their employees down by demanding too much for unskilled labor.	1
	granted, an assembly line is a monotonous job but i bet there are people who would line up to do the work for half the price.	1
	we sent our customer servic reps to the gm assembly plant to work in american made rental cars.	1
	at the gm plant they broke the windshield out of a chrysler.	1
	are these the type of people we want building us cars?	1
	can we trust them to build quality vehicles?	1
	after my experience with these crude people i have the answer to that question.	1

	.	1
	.	1
	i own an azera which is a v6 -- about 275 horsepower and i get about 15 city and 28 highway.	1
	i would guess that a v8 with 350 hp would be less.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised if the city mileage is 12-14 and the highway is 24-26 in 'real life' driving.	1
	the epa figures are often not accurate -- at least from my experience.	1
	i guess there's always hope that they can come up with some amazingly efficient v8 engine that gets better mileage than the v6 azera engine, but i wouldn't bet on it.	1
	but i would sure love a rwd v8 car with 350+ hp -- good mileage or not!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/444#msg444re: gas mileage [ricwhite]        re:444                if they are introducing a 350 hp v8, it certainly isn't meant to deliver great fuel efficiency       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/445#msg445re: gas mileage [ricwhite]        preety happy with my azera's mpg.	1
	i am averaging 23.8 combined over last 3,000mi.	1
	i would expect the genesis to range from 16 to 24.  average mileage seems to keep going up across the industry.	1
	technology is always improving.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/446#msg446re: gas mileage [jaymagic]        unfortunately there is only so much energy in a gallon of gas.	1
	and while technology is always improving there is the law of diminishing returns which states that it gets harder to increase gas mileage as you go along.	1
	add to that that the genesis will be larger (read heavier) with a more powerful engine (read less efficient in an mpg way) i seriously doubt you will be in the range of the azera in gas mileage.	1
	i would expect 15-10% less than the azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/447#msg447re: gas mileage [snakeweasel]        but then again, if i want excellent mpg, i would buy a honda civic hybrid... what is the best mpg that one can expect out of a rwd v8?	1
	does anybody have a list handy that shows a comparison of fe of various rwd v8 powered cars?	1
	make no mistake, at 2.85 a gallon as it is today at the 4 gas stations within a 1/2 mile radius from my house fe is a factor but i realize that i will have some trade-off with such a car.	1
	(growing up in europe, paying per litre of gas what one paid/pays here for a gallon of gas, even after 20 years, i still think i have hit the 'mother lode'.. yeah, i know: selfish....)                                and one more: all statements that i have seen so far from hyundai talk about the genesis at 'well below 6 seconds for 0-60, well above 300 hp and well below 30,000 bucks.	1
	the optimistic person that i am, i am still thinking i will get that car for less than 30,000 well equipped and with a v8... what leads us to believe that this might not be the case?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/448#msg448re: gas mileage [chiefload]        i would seriously doubt that you would be able to get a fully equipped v-8 genesis for under $30k, not unless the car bombed terribly and hyundai was forced to sell them in a 'fire' sale.	1
	a fully equipped v-6 azera runs 26-27k so what makes you think that a fully equipped v-8 powered car that is a step up from the azera will only be 2-3k less?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/449#msg449genesis pricing        all we are doing is guessing.	1
	my guess is that the genesis will start at about $33,500 with the 3.8l and that the v8 model will start at about $35,500.	1
	with all options, i suspect the 3.8l to come in at about $36,000 and the v8 at about $38,750.	1
	with next year's azera topping out at $31,500, that puts about a $4,500 miniimun difference between the two, when simiarly equipped.	1
	about like a sonata and the azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/450#msg450re: genesis pricing [jaymagic]        it will start under 30k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/451#msg451re: genesis pricing [jaymagic]        i suspect the genesis will be positioned to favorably compare with models selling at 1.5 times its price, at least...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/452#msg452i think the press release is wrong.	1
	according to the press release.	1
	the 'genesis' will be 'well under $30,000' and have the v8 engine with 'well over 300 hp'.	1
	right .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	personally, i don't see how that can happen.	1
	we might look back on that press release in year and shake our heads and laugh when we realize the v6 genesis will start at $35,000 and the v8 will be $40,000.	1
	i'm sure they will blame it on 'increased manufacturing costs' or the 'weakening of the won' or something.	1
	but i would be surprised if the v8 fully equipped genesis is not at least $10,000 more than an azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/453#msg453re: i think the press release is wrong.	1
	[ricwhite]        'weakening of the won'                                actually, weakening of the won would only lower the price, if anything.	1
	the reality for the longest time has been increased value of won.	1
	'personally, i don't see how that can happen.'	1
	that's pretty pessimistic.	1
	wouldn't you say?	1
	everything is speculation until prices are released but all sources, official and unofficial, points this being a sub-30k rwd luxury sedan starting.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/454#msg454re: i think the press release is wrong.	1
	[joe97]         points this being a sub-30k rwd luxury sedan starting                                yup, like v6 starting at $29,599 (which is 'sub-$30k') and v8 starting at $35,000.	1
	still, even at these prices it is still a good value if it can live up to the hypes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/455#msg455guessing at prices        if the genesis does come out, and is priced under $30k hyundai would be forced to lower the price of the azera.	1
	hardly feasible!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/456#msg456re: guessing at prices [floridabob1]        not necessarily at at all.	1
	as we stand now, the bh would probably start at or around a loaded azera.	1
	hey if the price of azera is lower, i certainly wouldn't be complaining, as many others        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/457#msg457i'm excited about the genesis        well .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	all we can do is wait and see.	1
	i am very excited about this car.	1
	i am leasing an azera right now, but would love to move to a genesis next year some time as long as it's not too pricey.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/458#msg458azera owners doomed        sure am glad i leased my '07.	1
	the closer genesis becomes reality the bigger the value hit azera takes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/459#msg459re: azera owners doomed [dborth]        i wouldn't say that.	1
	the genesis is a step or two above the azera and is bound to be priced accordingly.	1
	i really don't think the value of the azera is going to be hurt to much.	1
	was the value of the sonata hurt by the xg350 or the azera?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/460#msg460re: azera owners doomed [snakeweasel]        re 460:                 'was the value of the sonata hurt by the xg350 or the azera?'	1
	the '06 azera was a natural upgrade over the '06 sonata in price point, size and product features.	1
	huyndai would be fools to add to azera now what will no doubt be available in the genesis.	1
	case in point is the recent addition of the azera gls which does 2 things, devalues the limited and positions genesis as the logical upgrade.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/461#msg461really .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	you people can argue back and forth until the                 genesis                finally appears.	1
	then and only then will we know what the                 msrp                will be!	1
	there is no way that a fully equipped (loaded) genesis v8 will be made available for an msrp of less                than a minimum of $35k when a fully equipped and loaded limited azera is now over $31k.	1
	btw, the lower priced azera gls was produced for some other reasons.	1
	one reason was for the smaller less powerful v6 as an answer to the relatively poor fuel economy of the 3.8l.	1
	the differences between a 3.3l and a 3.8l cannot cost that much less to produce when compared to a 3.8l.	1
	that is not to say that we will not be able to purchase a loaded v8 genesis for less than the msrp.	1
	after they've been out for while, i hope the genesis will be available for less just as the limited azera is now.	1
	people have been saying that they bought fully loaded azera limiteds in the low $26k range.	1
	as i said above,                 time will tell.                                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/462#msg462re: azera owners doomed [dborth]        azera gls paves the way, among others, for 4-cyl sonata across the trims and increased fuel savings for gas consciousness consumers.       	1

	hyundai wants to make sure the answer is yes.	1
	the first of several rwd cars it plans to sell in the united states - the genesis - heads to dealers in the second half of 2008.	1
	'we know how to launch vehicles, but there will be some unique dealership stuff coming for that car,' said miles johnson, a hyundai motor america spokesman.	1
	'this will be different from selling elantras and accents, and that is what we are sorting out.'	1
	johnson said hyundai is developing the launch strategy.	1
	one requirement, he said, will be intensive training for at least one salesperson per dealership.	1
	that person needs to have 'a thorough understanding of the marketplace, the product and where it stands,' johnson said.	1
	training will cover the car's ride, handling, v-8 performance and rwd benefits.	1
	'we are looking down the road at three or four different products off this rwd chassis,' said johnson, who was interviewed at a hyundai event near here.	1
	'the customer experience needs to be a notch' above that for other hyundai products, he said, without elaborating.	1
	genesis is the leading name for the new model.	1
	it is being touted as a premium sedan for driving enthusiasts but without the premium price.	1
	hyundai says the car was benchmarked for torsional stiffness against a bmw 5 series.	1
	the optional 300-hp-plus, 4.6-liter v-8 will offer 0-to-60-mph acceleration in less than six seconds, hyundai says.	1
	premium features such as adaptive cruise control and a zf six-speed automatic transmission will be offered.	1
	hyundai has not disclosed pricing, but the company says the 3.8-liter v-6 model will be priced under $30,000, and a loaded genesis will not top $40,000.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/465#msg465oh.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	now i see        now they say the '3.8-liter v6' base model will be under 30k while the loaded v8 will not be above 40k -- probably $39,999 with taxes and title maybe $42,000.	1
	that latter figure is a little out of my price range.	1
	so, this is a little disappointing.	1
	of course by the time 2008 arrives, there could be further 'updates'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/466#msg466re: oh.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	now i see [ricwhite]        hyundai never said that the v8 version will be under $30k.	1
	anyone with a common sense can figure out that the 'under-30k' version is the v6.	1
	hyundai is good value, but not that good of a value...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/467#msg467re: oh.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	now i see [ricwhite]        a 7er in size, with the v6 starting under 30k, and loaded under 40, that's great value if you ask me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/468#msg468genesis pricing        where is this genesis pricing information coming from?	1
	is it speculation or an actual hyundai release?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/469#msg469as i said before        what does this mean for the azera, selling a modest 25-30k units a year.	1
	i wouldn't call that a great american success story.	1
	how will a more expensive car do?	1
	the only way around this logjam is to have the azera max out at $29k loaded, and have the genesis start at $29k, and the v8 start at $35k.	1

	it's just that i am an engineer and i was trained to analyze things scientifically and logically (i use my head instead of my you-know-what).	1
	both history and current hyundai sales numbers indicate that the genesis is not going to 'catch on fire' as some says it would.	1
	like i said, the veracruz-santa fe sales ratio along with the azera sales number will be a good indicator about how many genesis hyundai will sell.	1

	[louiswei]        so your thinking mathematically.	1
	well mr. engineer, no doubt your smart but their are other variables that could play into the sales numbers being higher.	1
	hyundai, has a winner but the most important issue for them is going to be getting that message out to the public.	1
	if i was ceo of hyundai, the first thing i would do is buy-off consumer media out lets like consumer reports, like the japanese have done for almost two-decades.	1
	that would mean at least 1.3 million people would be owners of the genesis, in a few short years.	1

	[rockylee]        this is getting really tiresome.	1
	please show any proof that consumer reports received any monetary assistance from the japanese manufactures as you have stated it.	1
	if you can't then you are just another guy out there trying to start or pass along the internet rumors (we already have too many of those lame a**es low lives and don't need another one).	1
	i am pretty sure you are not one of them so let's see the evidence(s).	1
	of course there are other variables.	1
	like maybe bmw, mb, lexus, infiniti and cadillac disappear from earth over night so the genesis becomes the only option out there for midsize luxury performance car buyers.	1
	however, with what the history and current sales trend are showing, i am more confident to go with the mathematical/logical route.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/484#msg484re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[louiswei]        fwiw with the genesis being rwd and having an avaliable high powered v-8 i can see that this could outsell the azera.       	1

	they have been known to give the exact same thing two different ratings, the only difference being the name slapped in the product.	1
	they have been known to give high marks to things that just didn't deserve it.	1
	they have did comparisons where they never even mentioned the so called industry standard (the product(s) that everyone else says is the best).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/486#msg486re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[snakeweasel]        it really doesn't matter if genesis is fwd or rwd, the issue here is are the messes willing to pay over $30k (in this case, well over) for a hyundai.	1
	no doubt in my mind that when the genesis hits the showroom it might be the best value in the auto industry.	1
	however, it could come up short just because it carries the hyundai badge.	1
	why?	1
	perception.	1
	shallow?	1
	yes but it's true and we all know it.	1
	thus i strongly recommend hyundai to create a luxury brand to go with the genesis, veracruz and the future rwd coupe.	1
	as for the cr issue, i would still like to see evidence(s).       	1

	[louiswei]         it really doesn't matter if genesis is fwd or rwd,                                it really does matter as those who seek a true driving experience will pass a v-6 fwd car for a v-8 fwd.	1
	i think there are enough people out there that want that v-8 luxury sedan but don't want to spend the $50k plus for one.	1
	however, it could come up short just because it carries the hyundai badge.	1
	why?	1
	perception.	1
	shallow?	1
	yes but it's true and we all know it.	1
	but the perception of hyundai is quickly changing.	1
	thus i strongly recommend hyundai to create a luxury brand to go with the genesis, veracruz and the future rwd coupe.	1
	herein lies the issue, you will still have the name issue no matter what they do.	1
	a luxury named hyundai will still be a huyndai just more expensive.	1
	just like a lexus is just a toyota and an acura is just a honda.	1
	as for the cr issue, i would still like to see evidence(s).	1
	the evidence is in their own printed material.	1
	i stopped caring what consumers ripoffs says some 20 years ago when they compared car stereos and pronounced panasonic (panisonic, yes i said panasonic) as the best car stereo.	1
	nowhere were blaupunkt and alpine (what everyone knew were the best) even mentioned.	1
	if cr told me the sky was blue i would check.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/489#msg489re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[snakeweasel]         but the perception of hyundai is quickly changing.	1
	that just meant that people are thinking hyundai isn't as bad as before but the overall perception of hyundai is still below toyota, honda and gm.	1
	even if hyundai is on par with the big boys that still doesn't mean it is ready to challenge the semi-luxury or luxury brands in their own back yards.	1
	just like a lexus is just a toyota and an acura is just a honda.	1
	maybe to you a lexus is just a toyota but to many others that's not the case.	1
	one thing to keep in mind here, folks here are very knowledgeable about the current auto industry but majority of the people are not.	1
	why do you think toyota and honda decided to create their own luxury brand instead of just slap their own badges on the very first ls400 and legend and call it a day?	1
	again, it's because of perceptions.	1
	toyota and honda back then (and even now) weren't known for making luxury sedans and so isn't hyundai today.	1
	can you imaging lexus sells its ls, gs with toyota badge and acura sells its rl with honda badge?	1
	i can't, at least not here in the states.	1
	again, people don't see toyota and honda as luxury brands thus their luxury products won't sell.	1
	same goes with hyundai.	1
	by the way, does anyone know what's the annual sales number of the chrysler 300?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/490#msg490300 sells 10k a month        and has since it's inception.	1
	a bad month is 7-8k.	1
	it used to be 12-13k a month, at it's peak!	1
	another problem with selling the genesis as a hyundai is this car seems custom-made for a luxury marque.	1
	if you start the precedent that this type of car will be a hyundai, you can't later move it to a different company.	1
	toyota decided in 1983 that the ls would start a new company.	1
	or more accurately, the new company will start with the lexus ls.	1
	i think hyundai wants to microwave a new perception and image, and they just have to wait.	1
	you can't force it.	1
	they obviously don't have the patience of toyota.	1
	i don't see the difference between them and vw.	1

	what's so hard?	1
	the phaeton starts                60k+; the bh will start under 30k.	1
	what are the chances the bh outsells the phaeton in the us?	1
	100% and then some...                                funny you brought up the 300 - as long as hyundai shares the slightest success the 300 has enjoyed, small or big, this would be a huge step forward.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/492#msg492re: 300 sells 10k a month [drfill]         i don't see the difference between them and vw.	1
	and we all know how well vw is doing right now in the states and what a huge mistake they made with the phaeton.	1
	hopefully phaeton the sequel will fare better than the original.	1
	i honestly don't think it is fair to compare vw and phaeton to hyundai and genesis but one couldn't deny that there are similarities between these 2 cases.	1
	hyundai can definitely learn a thing or two from vw's mistake and make sure that doesn't happen with the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/493#msg493re: 300 sells 10k a month [drfill]        wow, you guys are harsh or should i say brutual.	1
	i think you both are wrong on all accounts even though i respect both of y'alls opinions and drfill, did a great job using history as a reference.	1
	i however have a scenario for some of you and it's the way i see it.	1
	back in the 80's and 90's folks that were middle class that had good jobs could reasonably afford a luxury car.	1
	now that a lot of good paying jobs have left and those folks either are making half as much or had to retrain in another field but don't make the good money like they di or have the benefits they once had but use to own nice shit will look at hyuandai, as a oppertunity to own something as nice as they once have once again but will be able to afford it.	1
	this type of value has and still makes acura famous to this day.	1
	sure acura's prices have creaped up their over the years but compared to other luxury marques they are the value of luxury cars.	1
	when acura, got popular in the u.s. they weren't stellar cars.	1
	they over the years built the brand up and remade it.	1
	it's like some of you folks are throwing in the towel for hyundai.	1
	i think and believe hyundai, can earn a lot of sales with the approach they are taking and re make the brand.	1
	y'all are very frusterating.	1
	almost frusterating enough i might go out and buy a genesis, just to add a sale to their list and then zoom by ya both blowing your doors off !!!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/494#msg494snake and rockford...        i prefer to refer to consumer reports as clodsumer retorts.	1
	if ever there were a biased, dumb magazine this would be the one.	1
	i've seen them post pictures of an older version of a new model they're reporting on!	1
	and they expect us to believe their drivel?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/495#msg495re: 300 sells 10k a month [louiswei]        vw's biggest mistakes are that customer's thought they were doing buisness with ex-cons because of the way they got treated.	1
	vw's customer's also might as well booked a room at the service shop as their cars are very unreliable.	1
	those are the two knocks against vw, both service at the sale and after the sale, and the unreliability factor.	1
	it also didn't help vw, out making rebadged audi's even though i'd love to own a phaeton.	1
	they had some special surround sound system, massaging seats, and lot's of other gadgets.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/496#msg496re: 300 sells 10k a month [joe97]        agree, and the hyundai, is a luxury car and the 300's quality wouldn't cut it in a kia.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/497#msg497re: 300 sells 10k a month [louiswei]        i don't see the similarities.	1
	the fact hyundai usa already makes quality and reliable cars, the remaining to-do is further improving its brand image, which we all know takes more than overnight to overcome.	1
	keep selling economy cars won't improve its image any faster than going upmarket, possibly even reversing its fortune.	1
	setting up a luxury brand will take time, including dealer networks, this will happen but in the mean time, is hyundai going to sit around and do nothing?	1
	also, hyundai is not the only mainstream nameplate with $30k vehicles.       	1

	i wouldn't be to fast on that judgment.	1
	i know a few people that are seriously thinking of replacing their honda or toyota with a hyundai when it becomes time to swap vehicles.	1
	to be totally honest my elantra has been the most reliable car i have ever had and i hope to keep it a lot longer.	1
	maybe to you a lexus is just a toyota but to many others that's not the case.	1
	and many others it is.	1
	i know more than one mb owner who would never touch a lexus simply because in his words its an over prices toyota.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/501#msg501re: 300 sells 10k a month [louiswei]        well first of all the base phaeton came in at $20k or more than a fully equipped genesis is supposed to come in at.	1
	that is a lot of clams.	1
	also consider that vw has had a big downturn in the reliability of their cars, much the opposite of hyundai which is building some might good cars of late.	1
	there is a big difference between the two.       	1

	the question here to ask is...                                how many people are 'seriously' thinking of replacing their bmw 5-series, mb e-class, lexus gs and infiniti m with a hyundai?	1
	isn't that the market where the genesis is aiming after?	1
	as matter of fact, i'll do hyundai one better...                                how many folks are 'seriously' thinking of upgrading their current bmw 3-series, mb c-class, lexus is, infiniti g and acura tl with a hyundai?	1
	these are some serious questions hyundai need to find out if they want their first $30k plus rwd luxury performance sedan to succeed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/504#msg504re: 300 sells 10k a month [snakeweasel]        let's look at the vw/phaeton vs. hyundai/genesis comparison from a broader perspective point of view.	1
	in other words, let's look at it from the strategy level instead of tactical level that y'all have been focusing on...                                the similarity between those two is that both of them are attempting to go outside their traditional market thus the comfort zone is no longer there.	1
	both of these are attempts trying to challenge the big boys in their own back yard.	1
	they are trying to convert buyers from another market instead of simply join that market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/505#msg505re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[louiswei]        i do believe there was someone here stating they passed up something for their azera.	1
	on the whole i would take the azera over a 3 series any day.	1
	saturday we were having a party and cars came up and we started talking about the genesis.	1
	the person i was talking to didn't know about the car so we went to hyundais website for the genesis.	1
	this guy, an e-class owner, was very much interested in it just by its looks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/506#msg506re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[snakeweasel]         this guy, an e-class owner, was very much interested in it just by its looks.	1
	geez, i am very interested in genesis just by the way it looks too.	1
	why you think i am here in the first place?	1
	however, at the end of the day, if one can afford an e-class and money really isn't much of an issue do you think your friend is going to pick the genesis over the e-class?	1
	showing interest doesn't mean that one is going to buy that car.	1
	ask rocky if he's going to pick the genesis over the 08' cts and i think you know the answer better than i do.	1
	look at this way,                 most                hard-core domestic lovers wouldn't be caught dead in a hyundai and                 most                german/japanese luxury car owners are spoiled by their rides so hyundai won't even show up on their radar screen.	1
	who's left to buy a $30k luxury performance sedan from hyundai?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/507#msg507re: 300 sells 10k a month [louiswei]        thats a very bad comparison.	1
	vw tried to put out a high end car at high end prices.	1
	the base price of the phaeton was $65k which is 70% more expensive than vw's next expensive vehicle (the touareg).	1
	it was a hand built car to go up against cars such as the s class.	1
	your assessment that wv went out of their traditional market is true.	1
	hyundai on the other hand is producing a car that is slightly more than the next highest car.	1
	hyundai is not going outside their traditional market.	1
	they are pushing the envelope of their current market.	1
	thats the way to grow a company.	1
	if hyundai was putting out a $60k hand built car i would agree with you.	1
	but since they aren't your comparison doesn't work.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/508#msg508re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[louiswei]         why you think i am here in the first place?	1
	to bash hyundai.	1
	do you think your friend is going to pick the genesis over the e-class?	1
	your right money isn't an issue to him, he gts what he likes and wants.	1
	if he likes the genesis over any other car he will buy it.	1
	showing interest doesn't mean that one is going to buy that car.	1
	no but its a good indication especially when you know the guy buys things he shows interest in.	1
	ask rocky if he's going to pick the genesis over the 08' cts and i think you know the answer better than i do.	1
	i don't know ask him.	1
	if i didn't already own one i would most likely wait until the genesis comes out to compare the two.	1
	look at this way, most hard-core domestic lovers wouldn't be caught dead in a hyundai                                i am a domestic lover and i drive a hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/509#msg509re: 300 sells 10k a month [snakeweasel]        vw was selling cars/suvs in the low-$40k range (remember the w12 passat?	1
	another example of the going-outside-your-traditional-market disaster) and trying to compete with luxury flagships.	1
	hyundai is selling cars/suvs (except veracruz) in the mid-$20k range and trying to compete with luxury midsizers.	1

	the phaeton                  started                 at $65k.	1

	hyundai is selling cars/suvs (except veracruz) in the mid-$20k range and trying to compete with luxury midsizers.	1
	yes and the genesis is going to start in the upper $20's.	1
	going from mid $20's to upper $20's is nothing like jumping from around $40k to over $65k.	1
	the phaeton was a jump of over 70% from the next most expensive car wv had (based on base price).	1
	for your comparison to make sense the genesis would have to start at the upper 40's but its not it will be almost 10 grand less.	1
	both of them are trying to undercut their competitors with products carry lower-market manufactures' badges                                the phaeton in no way shape and form was priced to undercut the competition (starting at $65k and going up exceeding $100k) thats in the s class range.	1

	i was referring to vws two other mistakes, named passat w8 and touraeg.	1
	the third mistake was just the grandest mistake.	1
	the best argument for genesis becoming a notable success is the chrysler 300, but consider the bulk of it's sales are south of $30k, in base and touring form.	1
	the reasons 300 worked are many:                                1.  styling.	1
	original and uncompromised, it has a design still unmatched by the competition.	1
	2.  hemi.	1
	they jumped on the hemi wave at it's peak, and the hemi brought in traffic.	1
	3.  network.	1
	over 3000 dealers will have an advantage over less than 1000 hyundai (probably more like 5-600), and you get just that many more eyes on the product.	1
	4.  american.	1
	people want a great american hope.	1
	it fits the bill nicely.	1
	if azera was pumpin' out 50-60k, i'd say they have a shot.	1
	but 25-30k sales just doesn't inspire confidence.	1
	i say it's a poor idea, but it won't be the first.	1
	or the worst.	1

	would i be caught dead in a hyundai genesis ??????	1
	let's just say maybe.	1
	they are union made and i found out a little more on the treatment of hyundai, workers vs. other workers in south korea.	1
	they aren't abused like other workers and make more money then other union workers under better working conditions than i was lead to believe.	1

	2) we know hyundai can build a quality/reliable car, but hyundai building mainstream economy models will not improve its image any better than in the current case, going upmarket.	1

	2) we know hyundai can build a quality/reliable car, but hyundai building mainstream economy models will not improve its image any better than in the current case, going upmarket.	1

	genesis will be a great car and do not deserve the hyundai badge treatment.       	1

	simple!	1
	step 1.                                learn from success, not failure.	1
	follow toyota/lexus strategy to the letter.	1
	get people used to you as a quality car maker (not there yet), win some more awards.	1
	if you think you're there, wait another 5 years, then, another 2.                                sell some azeras.	1
	build some credibility!	1
	establish that you can sell what you make, before trying to sell what you don't.	1
	build a proper business case for a new luxury channel.	1
	put together a comprehensive rd program.	1
	come up with 3 great cars.	1
	release two to start, and the third in year 2.                                spend at least 1 year developing a premium ad campaign, not the gm-style horsestuff we've been getting.	1
	develop your dealer and service network.	1
	come up with a name.	1
	then you can go to step 2.                                until then, do not pass go!	1

	[louiswei]         it's just that i am an engineer and i was trained to analyze things scientifically and logically (i use my head instead of my you-know-what).	1
	predicted genesis sales = current azera sales x ( current veracruz sales / current santa fe sales )                                ive been lurking here for a while and enjoy the discussion but since i was also an engineer (when i was a working stiff) youve got to help me out.	1
	youre going to have to prove to me the validity of your equation before you will convince me that you are not thinking with the bracketed part of your statement above.	1
	i never saw anything like this before (looks like a seat of the pants equation derived from dart throwing with your eyes closed).	1
	now, if you could plug in some numbers maybe i could put my sliderule (thats what we used when i went to school) to work so that i can figure it out.	1

	[jmonroe]        maybe i could put my sliderule (thats what we used when i went to school) to work so that i can figure it out.	1
	it's a waste of time because there's no correlation.	1
	the veracruz is an suv and the santa fe is an suv.	1
	the genesis is a sedan.	1
	so much for 'scientifically and logically (i use my head instead of my you-know-what).'	1
	heee, hee.	1
	colleges these days....        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/521#msg521re: boy, you guys took the ball and ran with it!	1
	[louiswei]         how about getting ready for the debut of the luxury brand and continuing to improve the current products?	1
	isn't that what hyundai is doing right now?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/522#msg522re: it's easy to think it may not be the second coming!	1
	[jmonroe]        the reasons of that equation are:                                1. i see santa fe as an equal to azera in hyundai's suv lineup.	1
	2. since veracruz is a step up from santa fe and genesis is a step up from azera i see the genesis is an equal to the veracruz in hyundai's sedan lineup.	1
	in case the point didn't come across clearly:                                hyundai sedans: sonata - azera - genesis                hyundai suvs/cuvs: tucson - santa fe - veracruz                                3. since the veracruz is starting at $26.5k and the limited awd version tops out at $38k (roughly the range where genesis will fall into) i see its sales would be a good indicator of how well the messes will accept a $30k+ hyundai.	1
	because of the 3 reasons above thus i came up the equations previous posted.	1
	i am not saying that the equation is accurate to a certain degree but if i'll have to make a prediction about how many genesis hyundai will sell that'll be the equation i rely on.	1
	i know it would not reflect the reality because there are many 'noise variables' but it is better than pulling some number out of my you-know-what.	1
	i would love to plug in some numbers but since the veracruz has only been in market for very short period of time i am afraid it won't reflect the whole picture.	1
	maybe in a month or 2 when the veracruz sales becomes stable then we can come back and revisit the equation.       	1

	louiswei, i've never seen you take so many shots.	1
	you are beginning to know what i feel like sometimes.	1
	i respect your opinion pal, but it seems like your estimated sales numbers for the genesis, are coming from you know just a little at least.	1
	louiswei, don't you think it's possible that hyundai, has bigger and brighter plans beyond the genesis.	1
	maybe their future luxury division will have base cars like the mercedes s-class for the above $40,000 mark with their top offering being a rolls royce or bentley for under $100k ?????	1
	we just don't know what might be up this company's sleeve yet and while the genesis, might be the company's top offering now it just might be it's middle premium luxury division like buick is at gm.	1

	[rockylee]        rocky, apparently you don't get my points either...                                1. i like genesis, probably won't buy one but wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family (same goes for many gm models).	1
	yes, i am biased, blah blah blah...                                2. what i don't like is the idea of genesis carrying the hyundai badge.	1
	3. i am not here to bash the genesis but to bash the idea of genesis carrying the hyundai badge.	1
	4. if hyundai debuts the genesis along with a luxury brand then i'll be the first to toss out my 'equation'.	1
	5. hyundai is ready for a luxury brand with the genesis, veracruz and a performance coupe based on the genesis platform.	1
	6. hyundai is not a luxury or semi-luxury brand and never will be.	1
	spin it anyway you want this simply just won't happen.	1
	if honda, toyota, nissan are not luxury/semi-luxury brands then hyundai sure the heck isn't.	1
	7. mainstream brands (like hyundai) sell mainstream cars (some with luxury touch) and luxury brands sell luxury cars.	1
	if hyundai is marketing the genesis as a full-size rwd performance sedan like the 300 and future g8 then it will be fine with the hyundai badge.	1
	however, if it is going to be                 luxury                performance sedan like the 5er, e-class, gs and m then the hyundai badge treatment simply won't cut it.	1
	luxury performance sedan != performance sedan with luxury touch                                i hope this post gets my points across...       	1

	and there are plans for the numbers it would see...                                i see the hondai company as having enough smarts to do market studies about its buyers of current and proposed future cars.	1

	there's an image change that's has evolved even faster than the gm image change has been.	1

	although most azera owners are pleased with their cars, hyundai is not blowing the doors off the showrooms with consumers rushing to make purchases.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/561#msg561re: genesis, if only i could........ [louiswei]         hyundai didn't upgrade the azera but did offer a cheaper version.	1
	the cheaper version had various reasons behind the decision.	1
	to those with doubts consumers are not ready for a 30k+ hyundai, just keep in mind the demographics of the azera is made up just under 90% of the limited trim, and most with the ultimate package, which pushes the msrp over $30k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/562#msg562veracruz bombing like touareg, millenia, w8 passat, phaeton, azera        hyundai only sold 650 veracruz suv's in april despite great reviews.	1
	veracruz costs the same as genesis which will arrive in a year and a half, $27,000-38,000.	1
	even worse, just a month after introduction, hyundai is forced to sell the veracruz for hundreds below invoice because nobody wants to pay $30,000+ for a hyundai.	1
	in the veracruz prices paid and buying experience thread on this site, a buyer paid $500 below invoice while getting $1000 more than anywhere else for his trade-in so basically $1500 below invoice!	1
	another horrible decision to sell a car with an economy badge at a luxury price, just like the mazda millenia, vw w8 passat, phaeton, and touareg.	1
	using louiswei's formula, hyundai sold 6743 santa fes in april compared to 650 veracruz, so a hyundai genesis should have less than 1/10 the azera's annual sales of 24,000, or way below hyundai's modest goal of 20,000 genesis sales per year.	1
	speaking of the touareg, vw's $38-59,000 suv is basically the same car as audi's $40-60,000 q7 suv, except it's slightly cheaper and doesn't have the luxury brand name.	1
	in april, vw sold 468 touaregs and audi sold 1867 q7s.	1
	so i may have been wrong about hyundai selling 3 times as many cars by starting a luxury division, it may be 4 times as many, or even 10+ times as many if louiswei is right and the genesis sells less than 2400 per year as a hyundai.	1
	mazda had to slash $4000 off the millenia's price to $31,000 4 years after introduction, but dealerships must have needed further incentives to sell the car below invoice, cutting mazda's profits to 1/2 or 1/3.	1
	lexus increased ls400 prices from $35,000 to $50,000 five years after introduction, potentially increasing profits per car 3 or 4 times.	1
	so 6-12 times as much profit per car and 4-10+ times as many sold equals 24-120+ times as much money as calling it a hyundai.	1
	plus more sales and better reputation for the rest of the hyundai/kia/genesis lines just like toyota experienced after the launch of lexus.	1
	hyundai should start a genesis luxury brand with the upcoming m sedan and rebadge the veracruz as the x suv after adding more amenities like real wood trim and navigation system and the more powerful genesis engines.	1
	with the foolish and catastrophic decision to try to sell a $27-38,000 suv as a hyundai, they may have already caused irreparable harm to the concept of hyundai's luxury division.	1
	if hyundai tries to sell a $29-40,000 luxury sedan with similar specs as a v8 rwd lexus ls460, as a hyundai, they should forever give up on the idea of a luxury division or being the #1 carmaker like toyota, and settle for being the korean mazda.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/563#msg563re: answer for lou [drfill]         vw actually had an advantage over the genesis, since it had a track record, and it was selling as a premium family sedan.	1

	hyundai has no leg to stand on.	1
	so the difference is night and day.	1
	vw was better off!	1
	yes and no.	1
	vw had a better track record it didn't have hyundai's past image when it first started in 86 and early 90s, but then it also has the track record of poor reliability and customer service, to date.	1
	various publications will tell you vw's track record of quality, reliability, etc is in much worst shape than hyundai (us).	1
	see, vw made it a mistake by selling a $60k+ luxury sedan; vw made it a mistake by selling a $40k mainstream/premium midsize passat.	1
	hyundai is not making a mistake selling a $30k luxury large rwd sedan.	1
	at best, the passat is comparable to the azera, despite the azera also being a large sedan:                                passat - azera                phaeton - bh                                phaeton                60k+; bh                28k-40k                                if i were to spend 60k, i wouldn't get the phaeton, as nice as the car was (no question about it).	1
	instead, i will pick up a bh, and one of the the following: cts/g35/3er                                no brainer, why get one when you can get one + one        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/564#msg564re: veracruz bombing like touareg, millenia, w8 passat, phaeton, azera [nyc         and it's not like veracruz isn't selling because there aren't enough units at the dealership, nobody wants to pay $30,000+ for a hyundai!	1
	wrong on both counts.	1
	1) most dealers don't have enough units                2) people are paying 30k+ hyundai - see my previous post.	1
	hyundai needs to get the word out about azera and veracruz.	1
	both are fantastic vehicle few knew their existence (unlike the sonata and elantra which has track records behind them).	1
	the equation is flawed.	1
	you can't predict sales with some equation, the auto industry doesn't work like that.	1
	and again, a luxury brand will come, but will take time.	1
	a lot of these suggestions are unrealistic, to say the least.	1
	keep in mind hyundai's only been in the us for some 20 year.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/565#msg565two tings!	1

	it was the mazda3 of it's day, the anti-camry, and was getting all the press it wanted.	1
	great commercials.	1
	comparison victories.	1
	even high resale value!	1
	passat proved the car wasn't the problem.	1
	selling a $40k vw was the problem.	1
	spin it however you like.	1
	the market spoke loud and clear.	1
	#2:  how many people buy diamond rings in paper bags?	1
	hyundai can try, but they will learn, one way or another.	1
	btw, hyundai sales were flat last year, with a virtually new lineup, and sales are down this year?	1
	there is no excuse for that.	1
	the answer is not charge more for product.	1

	so 120 times as many sold at 6-12 times the profit per car, hyundai would make 720-1440 times as much money by starting a luxury division.	1
	or infinitely more since the phaeton should be selling 0 units pretty soon.       	1

	or infinitely more since the phaeton should be selling 0 units pretty soon.	1
	again, you're speculating.	1
	when the luxury brand arrives, let's talk, but until then, there is no guarantee, you make it sound like an unknown luxury brand will automatically equal success (not that i'm saying hyundai's luxury brand will not succeed).	1
	if luxury brands are soundly successful without any work, then everyone should just go out and create one...the auto industry just doesn't work like this.	1
	it's not about some equation, nor all things are always equal...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/569#msg569genesis vs azera        again, i say, hyundai should load up the azera to determine if it's buyer base will support a more expensive model.	1
	from the forum buyer reports, most people report making purchases at hugh discounts.	1
	bmw, mb, lexus, infinity, acura do not offer these types of discounts.	1
	there must be a reason.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/570#msg570re: veracruz bombing like touareg, millenia, w8 passat, phaeton, azera [nyc [joe97]         the auto industry just doesn't work like this                                so, want to enlighten us about how does the auto industry work?	1
	based on history...                                honda created a luxury brand called acura, then                toyota created a luxury brand called lexus, then finally                nissan crated a luxury brand called infiniti.	1
	all three have been successful to a certain degree with lexus claimed na's top selling luxury brand within 10 years of its debut.	1
	if hyundai is modeling itself after toyota might as well do it the whole way, not the cost-cutting (or half-a**) way.	1
	it is expensive to start a brand new luxury division (all the advertising, marketing and new dealer chain...) but it has to understand that                 it takes money to make money                .	1
	sometimes (well, most of the time) shortcuts just ain't gonna cut it.	1
	as for the vw/hyundai comparison.	1
	the point is that both of them being the mainstream brands with history and statistics telling us that buyers just won't bite on the 'over-$40k vw' idea.	1
	doesn't matter if it's phaeton, passat w8 or toureg.	1
	with that as an example, it is reasonable to speculate that hyundai will have trouble to sell its over $30k units (with the veracruz sort of proving the point).	1
	of course, another example is the mazda with its 929 and millennium.	1
	those might not be the best comparisons in the world but if one can get out of the model-to-model comparison mind frame and look it from the overall company strategic point of view then there are definitely some similarities.	1
	since the jap 3 have proven that a new luxury division will work (with good products of course) and vw and mazda sort of proved that luxury entries with mainstream badge won't then now it's up to hyundai to decide which route to take.	1
	one thing i learned in the last few years...                                 history does repeat itself.        	1

	there is no conformation from hyudai about creating                luxury division.	1
	imho, hyudai should make a luxury brand in future.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/587#msg587re: hyundai might come out with a luxury brand [jmonroe]        a top of the line azera (in korea it's grandeur) is around w40 million in korea and that translates to us$43k.	1
	a top of the line azera limited has an msrp of $31k here in the us.	1
	that's 72% of the price in korea.	1
	with that in mind...                                w45 million = us$49k                w60 million = us$65k                                72% of that are $35k and $47k, respectively.	1
	looks like the us-bound genesis will start at mid-low $30k and top out around mid $40k.	1
	this pricing makes sense to me.	1
	pretty much hyundai is charging 3-series kind of price for a 5-series plus kind of car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/589#msg589re: hyundai might come out with a luxury brand [jmonroe]        top of the line sonata goes for w35 million and top of the line tiburon (in korea it's called tuscani) for w26 million in korea.	1
	convert to us dollar that's $38k and $28k, respectively.	1
	the msrp of a top of the line sonata is $26.5k and a top of the line tiburon is $23.5k.	1
	compare to the korean version, that's 70% and 83% of the prices, respectively.	1
	if hyundai is following the current pricing strategy one can safely to assume that the us genesis will cost somewhere between 70% to 80% of the price of the korean version.	1
	here's the link of the                 hyundai korea website                                i know a lot of y'all have great expectation that the genesis will start 'well below' $30k so i am sure posts like this won't be well received                .	1
	however, i am not here to play 'debbie downer', just merely stating the facts.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/590#msg590a dude i know test drove genesis!!!	1
	this is he wrote.	1
	holy mama!!!	1
	'i had a chance to drive the final stage genesis prototype yesterday.	1
	and to the poster who asked how we could know for sure that this coupe is a hyundai... i can tell you it is a hyundai vehicle because i saw the coupe with my own eyes while i was there.	1
	more on this at the bottom.	1
	without revealing corporate secrets, i can tell you that the genesis is simply stunning.	1
	i am not able to tell you what kind of options or powertrains it will come with because it is still being finalized (and i value my job), but it certainly won't lack in the power department or luxury features.	1
	the drive... wow.	1
	i was smiling ear to ear after the test drive, and i drove a base model test mule.	1
	if i didn't know any better, i would have asked if it were a mercedes benz s-class or a lexus ls.	1
	i mean, it was just incredible.	1
	i could not believe that a car like this would be offered in the 30k-40k range.	1
	i thought i was excited about the g8, but i can tell you that when the time comes, i will be at the hyundai dealership, not pontiac.	1
	unfortunately, the front and rear fascia design were still under development and thus heavily camouflaged.	1
	i wasn't allowed to take pictures, anyway.	1
	bottom line is that hyundai has built a real contender in the luxury rwd market and v8 is definitely being considered for the u.s. market from what i was told.	1
	as much as i love my tl, i may be replacing her next year.	1
	i am still in shock and awe of how stunning the genesis was as i type this.	1
	if you guys are getting your hopes up for the genesis, then i can confidently say that you will not be disappointed.	1
	now onto the coupe... i was not able to get a close look because it was being driven away and it was very heavily camouflaged.	1
	but i could still make out the overall shape of it and it was beautiful.	1
	i'm talking aston martin db9 greenhouse meets ferrari 599 fiorano roof line.	1
	you may think that i am exaggerating, but i can tell you that very few cars strike me as beautifully sculpted.	1
	but hyundai got the lines on this (at least the parts i could see) very nicely.	1
	solid and hard, yet soft and flowing lines.	1
	we are on a very subjective topic, yes, but it definitely gave me a chubby looking at it.	1
	oh and we hit 130 in an azera on a 40-degree bank high speed test track.	1
	that was frigging fun.	1
	i was on the inside and it felt like i could just reach out the window and touch the pavement.	1
	it feels like you are sitting vertical to the ground and the g-forces pulling you toward the outside.	1

	i recall when i worked for dow i was going into the city to visit a college friend who worked at ford.	1

	why is he allowed to test drive the prototype genesis?	1
	does he work for hyundai?	1
	i wouldn't think so since he 'never cared about hyundai'.	1
	does he work for one of the car mags?	1
	i highly doubt it since the genesis is still at least a year away from production.	1
	so it makes little sense that hyundai will let the press to test drive it now.	1
	again, not trying to bash the genesis here.	1
	just raising a few questions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/601#msg601he is not selling        he works for the hyundai's bama plant.	1
	and yes, he is a classy white dude, not korean and definitely not a hyundai salesman.	1
	i believe he is an engineer.	1
	this is other quote of his.	1
	hope he doesn't mind it                                'yep, they are doing prototype testing in the u.s. as well.	1
	but the 3 test mules i examined were at the namyang rd center in korea.	1
	the one you saw probably came from hatci near you in ann arbor.	1
	(probably doing suspension and nvh testing on the horrible i-75 pavement  )                                when hyundai unveiled the car at the ny auto show, one thing they did not show was the interior.	1
	the story is that they had an initial interior design, but scrapped it for a new one.	1
	the one in the prototype i drove was very nicely done.	1
	it reminded me of the s-class and to an extent, the infiniti q45.	1
	even the base model had an lcd screen setup and a higher trim level vehicle had a central control station for the vehicle's functions (think idrive but more intuitive).	1
	in other words, you will not be disappointed.	1
	derrick is right.	1
	hyundai is not trying to sway bmw and mercedes buyers into buying the genesis or any other products in the line-up.	1
	these brands do not just command loyalty from their buyers, but it is largely a status symbol.	1
	people in that market do not care about value; they want image.	1
	but if you want to advertise your products, you should advertise where you want it to be, not where it is today (toyota/lexus is the benchmark).	1
	hyundai is looking into the future and is trying to build up the brand image.	1
	the bh is the first step and will not be the last in this market segment.'	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/603#msg603hyundai / genesis -- there's no difference!!	1
	i know the quality of hyundai vehicles has improved dramatically since the original excel of the '80's, but there are still major obstacles facing the company...  regardless of the branding.	1
	the hyundai models do quite well in jd power iqs studies, as well as consumer reports, but let's face it, very few people would feel 'proud' to own one!	1
	basically, the brand sucks!	1
	when your friends or family ask you 'what kind of new car did you buy?	1
	', do you want to tell them 'hyundai'?	1
	you're going to have to come up with a good excuse as to why you bought one...                                to make matters worse, toyota/nissan/honda now all offer small cars at essentially the same price.	1
	it used to be that you could buy a hyundai at a significant discount to other, better-known brands such as toyota.	1
	have you seen the hyundai prices recently?!?!	1
	with each new model, the prices are going up big time.	1
	yes, they are much better vehicles than the ones they replace, but personally i don't think they've earned the reputation/value part yet.	1
	santa fe's going up to $30,000!?	1
	veracruz even higher?!?!	1
	that said, i did see and read about the 'concept genesis' rwd v8 sedan the company showed at the ny auto show.	1
	it sounds good, but i, for one, will withhold final judgment until it arrives.	1
	if it's priced like a lexus/infiniti/acura (or a german make), i'll pass for sure!	1
	even if it's the same price as a toyota/nissan/honda, i would have to think long and hard about considering it.	1
	in order to win customers, they need a product that's better than competitors for same or ideally less money.	1
	and please, please, don't make the new car drive like a buick!!	1
	you have it make it worth my while to buy a hyundai.	1
	there are a ton of great cars out there with more prestigious brands, and for similar prices!	1
	if the guys at hyundai think that a simple renaming of a brand will suddenly increase their sales (or prices), they are sadly mistaken and need a reality check.	1
	who's going to pay $30k for some unknown brand?!	1
	i would buy a loaded accord or camry for under $30k, and not have to think twice.	1
	also, there are only so many auto manufacturers in the world.	1
	if a 'genesis' goes on sale one day, don't you think people will be asking 'who makes that thing?'	1
	once it's associated with hyundai, it's got the same brand problem.	1
	just my 2 cents, but i don't think i am the only one with this perspective.	1
	p.s.	1
	-- when the chinese car companies come, do you think their new, unknown brands will be able to suddenly command toyota prices?!	1
	i may be dating myself, but i remember back in teh '70's when toyota's were considered cheap and tinny, though they were never unreliable.	1
	it's taken 25-30 years for them to establish their brand.	1
	how many years of good product has hyundai given us?	1

	to make matters worse, toyota/nissan/honda now all offer small cars at essentially the same price.	1
	yeah but if memory serves you get a stripped down honda or toyota for about the price of a nicely equipped hyundai.	1
	it sounds good, but i, for one, will withhold final judgment until it arrives.	1

	youve got a point there, so when i bought my 05 xg350, to avoid this embarrassment i grabbed a cold chisel and a hammer and removed every hyundai badge both inside and out that i could find.	1
	i wanted to just pull them off or unbolt them but those guys even put their badges on with the same quality as they build the car itself.	1
	imagine that, they must have known people like me would try to do something like this, but im just too smart for them.	1
	prestige is everything, so i bought some mb badges and glued them on.	1
	note, i had to buy these on line because when the local mb dealer got wind of what i wanted to do he refused the sale.	1
	i think he had his nose in the air too.	1
	i cant tell you how thrilled i am just knowing that now my friends and family are not ashamed of me.	1

	i spent six months researching cars until i purchased my azera with the ultimate package.	1
	i am not a risk taker when it comes to this much money.	1
	but after reading what other owners and reviewers had to say, i was convinced that i was buying a quality car at a value price.	1
	and this has proven to be true in every sense.	1
	i consider myself a member of the pioneer group which must exist to get fledgling cars off the ground and on their way to fame.	1
	truthfully, i considered what others, including my family, might think.	1
	but i soon put those thoughts aside.	1
	i now find myself quite proud of my purchase.	1
	my friends and family are definitely supportive and impressed.	1

	my only experience with this is that i dropped off my car when the dealership was closed (filling out a form, putting the key in an envelope and dropping it off through a slot for the service manager) the next time i heard back from them was about 10:30-11:00 the next morning telling me my car was ready to be picked up.	1
	they fixed the problem no questions asked and quickly.	1
	so i don't know where you are getting your information.	1
	most forum participants have knowledge far exceeding the typical dealer staff member.	1
	lol thats the case with hyundai as well as toyota, honda, subaru, ford, gm, bmw, mb, lexus, acura, nissan and every car manufacturer.	1
	as a hyundai owner,i have received no updates from the company about upcoming projects.	1
	gee when i owned a ford i didn't get any updates about upcoming projects, no did i when i owned a chevy or a dodge or a chrysler nor does my sisters with their cars (toyotas and chevys).	1

	my past 3 vehicles were 2 bmw's and an infiniti q45.	1
	although i admit that they were higher priced cars, there is no question that the other companies and the dealerships were more knowledgeable about their products, as well as more responsive to customer needs and desires.	1
	if you are comparing price only, the hyundai is a great price, and a good car.	1
	i am not unhappy with my azera, but with a little more effort from hyundai, i could be a lot happier.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/616#msg616re: my point is this..... [floridabob1]        i have to mostly agree with floridabob.	1
	although my dealership is very responsive, it is not as knowledgeable as i would prefer.	1
	i get the 'my hyundai' or whatever it is called newsletter, so i am seeing updated info via that.	1
	my perception is that hyundai is advertising more and working to improve customer service, they just need to keep at it and doing a little more would not hurt.	1
	i expect the 'genesis' or whatever to be a hit, but i do think it will take at least a couple of years for hyundai to be thought of as having higher end cars.	1
	with what they say they can do with variations on the genesis platform, i would expect a more robust higher end lineup in about 4 to 5 years and that hyundai will have a lot more capability and credibility at that point.       	1

	i have also experienced this.	1
	maybe the sales people should do a little research on their own vehicles they sell.	1
	last time i was in for service, i waited in the showroom for about two hours watching tv.	1
	so did the other sales reps.  they were also chatting about 'funny' customers and a pending ugly divorce of one of the sales people.	1
	i don't know how much longer they sat around after i left, but maybe they should have gone on their computers and looked up information about their cars, or at least read their own brochures.	1
	i know much more about the azera than they do.	1
	this particular dealership didn't even know how to do a lease when i first tried to get my azera.	1
	i tried to explain to them in detail speaking very slowly and telling them how to enter the information on their computer.	1
	they still couldn't do it and insisted that the $600 per month 27 month lease was correct.	1
	when i laughed at them and shook my head, i was kicked out of the dealership.	1
	lol.	1
	i ended up leasing the azera from a competing dealership for around $350 per month.	1
	i suspect out of 8 hours in a day, the average hyundai sales person at that particular dealership spends no more than 1-2 hours actually 'working.'	1
	all the rest of the time they sit around watching tv or talking.	1
	what a life.	1
	how much do they get paid?	1
	and i have more stories.	1
	like the hyundai dealership that jacked up the 'invoice' pricing by about $800 on the azera and told me all of the online invoice pricing services and all of the other hyundai dealerships were wrong.	1
	lol.	1
	then they tried to tack on a 'dealer name fee' of $350 for the 'privilege' of putting the name 'ken garff' on their dealership.	1
	lol.	1
	i left, of course.	1
	oh .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	okay -- one more story.	1
	i looked up another hyundai dealership in utah and made an appointment to see them about leasing an azera.	1
	i drove the 50 minutes or so there and found myself in an open field of weeds.	1
	i called them on my cell phone and found out that the address in the phone book was wrong -- which they didn't even know (how odd is that?).	1
	so, i drove the additional 15 minutes to finally get there.	1
	when i arrived i knew exactly what i wanted and what the 'correct' numbers were for the lease.	1
	i negotiated a good price for the azera after about 25 minutes and then put in motion the lease arrangements.	1
	the saleperson left me for a long time -- almost 20 minutes.	1
	when he came back, he told me that the only person who knew how to work the computer for a lease was off that day and they tried but couldn't do it.	1
	they tried to get him on the phone without luck.	1
	so, i drove back home after taking a half day off work without any lease aggreement.	1
	they didn't call me back for two days and when they did, they told me they could do the lease, but the negotiated amount on the vehicle was too low and they would have to raise it.	1
	i said, 'no deal' and continued on my way thinking that there must be one hyundai dealership within 300 miles that knew what they were doing.	1
	oh my, i have a lot of stories.	1
	anyway .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	this is not exclusive to hyundai, i realize, but i was just baffled by the incompetent nature of the sales people at several hyundai dealerships.	1
	i mean, i spend hours and hours weekly educating myself on the latest in my job and i usually don't have an idle minute when i work.	1
	the contrast is totally outrageous, imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/622#msg622re: my point is this..... [ricwhite]        re: 622                i agree completely.	1
	a good salesman will take the time to learn about the product he is selling.	1
	the tv watchers are only marking time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/623#msg623adding relevance to my post #622        my purpose for bringing up my hyundai dealership experiences in post #622 was to point out that for hyundai to want to sell a luxury line such as the genesis when they act so incompetent with the current lower line is laughable.	1
	in contrast to my hyundai experiences, i also visited acura and bmw dealerships.	1
	besides the azera, i was looking at the acura tl and the bmw 330 as possible purchases.	1
	i found the sales people there much much more competent.	1
	they acted professional, knew what they were talking about, sounded educated and articulate, dressed well, and appeared 'busy' most of the time.	1
	the dealership was clean and much more comfortable.	1
	huge contrast to my hyundai experiences.	1
	i was so stunned with how bad the hyundai dealerships were that i almost scratched the azera off my list  regardless of how much i liked the car.	1
	if it werent for a good dealership i found 2 hours away  which was my last try  i would have gone acura tl.	1
	if hyundai wants to play with the 'big boys' and offer a competing luxury line like the genesis they're going to have to massively improve their dealerships and cs departments.	1
	i mean in a huge way or it will be a completely laughable mess.	1
	you can't expect to sell a 40k car and offer 15k service.	1
	that's why offering a 40k luxury car will cost them much more than just the new line.	1
	they'll have to remodel their showrooms, hire new employees, revamp their training programs, offer services beyond what they are offering now.	1
	this is very expensive, folks.	1
	but if they want to get into that 'market' they better suck it up and be prepared to compete in all those other areas.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/624#msg624re: my point is this..... [ricwhite]        most car salesmen are very new to what they are selling and many dealers just want warm bodies to sell.	1
	yearly turnover at a lot of dealerships is close to 200%.	1
	i remember one time at a subaru dealership the salesman showed me the 2,4 liter v6 they had.	1
	i looked at it and the first thing i said was that its a 4 cylinder engine.	1
	he insisted that it was a 2.4 liter v6 and i kept insisting that while it was a 2.4 liter it was also a 4 cylinder.	1
	the salesman was getting a little upset at me until i pointed out that there was only 4 spark plug wires.	1
	last time i was in for service, i waited in the showroom for about two hours watching tv.	1
	so did the other sales reps. they were also chatting about 'funny' customers and a pending ugly divorce of one of the sales people.	1
	when i was in sales i had the attitude that there was no down time.	1
	if i had no customers i was learning about our products, our competitors products and our industry.	1
	if i wasn't doing that i was trying to bring in new customers.	1
	when i supervised a sales staff i installed that into them.       	1

	i will admit that the ambiance of my dealership may not be up to the level of the acura dealership where i have purchased 7 acuras over the years.	1
	that being said i came in for my first hyundai (06 sonata lx v6) being well equipped from a knowledge-wise point of view as regards features and price.	1
	i dealt with the sales manager and received excellent and fair treatment.	1
	i subsequently bought my second car (06 azera limited) and my son just bought an 07 santa fe.	1
	bottom line i treated the staff with respect, recognized that the dealer's are in business to make a profit and in my case i know it was fair.	1
	any businessman will tell you that in order to stay in business you must make some sort of profit.	1
	i expected fair treatment and received it.	1
	the service manager is conscientious and customer oriented and i have a good rapport with all.	1
	i have recommended this dealership and will continue to do so.	1
	yes the showroom is cramped, not opulent, and has a less than luxurious appearance.	1
	so what!	1
	be nice and you get treated nicely.	1
	be knowledgeable, and don't try to be a 'wiseguy' and in most cases you will get fair treatment in return.	1
	in every business there are bad apples but when you find a 'good one' the results can be most satisfying.	1
	in my 'many years' of buying and leasing ( i am a real senior citizen) my hyundai dealership, hyundai of westchester in yonkers, ny ranks up there with the best, and i have no financial interest only happy to be a satisfied customer and recommend others to see how nice the purchasing of a car can be.       	1

	well, definitely not.	1
	my suggestion is:                                hyundai should debut a luxury brand that's independent to hyundai dealerships with an opening-day lineup                consisting:                                a large size rwd luxury sedan with standard v6 and optional v8 engines - genesis.	1
	a medium size luxury cuv - move the veracruz from hyundai, load it up and insert it here.	1
	a rwd performance-base coupe with luxurious touches - the coupe can be based on a shortened genesis chassis.	1
	most likely the coupe will need more time to develop but looks like the genesis and upscale veracruz is ready to go.	1
	hyundai can start the new luxury brand off with the sedan and cuv and have the coupe coming online a year later.	1
	if both acura and lexus can start off with 2 models i don't see why can't hyundai pull the same trick off.       	1

	i agree they could start with a 'premium' version of the veracruz and the 2 grades of genesis with a coupe following.	1
	hyundai certainly has the bucks to subsidize an independent dealer network but...where do they find and establish such a network for upscale products and the support elements of service to make it work?	1

	i didn't mention forgiving him, i just said forget it.	1
	drdonrs...i appreciated your comments for many reasons regarding dealing with dealers' salespeople.	1
	it's true, if one of us goes in to the dealer yapping it up about how much we know about a particular rig or two we're interested in and don't even really listen when our salesman is talking, nor show him/her any respect whatsoever, are we really giving them a fair chance?	1
	sure, they should know more about the car but if they don't, does that mean hyundai's are crap, or kia's are crap?	1
	i say it doesn't mean that and really shouldn't even imply that.	1
	learn all you want and test drive and negotiate.	1
	what a particular salesperson knows about your favorite rig really need not be involved in your negotiations.	1
	if you correct them and they keep forgetting, well, then, yes that can be irritating.	1
	that much is true.	1
	i don't think hyundai is going to differentiate and make a 'genesis' separate dealer location/business.	1
	i see them selling these rwd cars right off their hyundai lot.	1
	and sell many of them they most certainly will.	1
	my admiration for both kia and hyundai grows with each passing month.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/642#msg642distribution        if you check the hyudai website, it seems that they have made the decision to market the genesis at hyundai dealerships.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/644#msg644after following that link, here is my assessment        i see sonata, altima, and 5-series in the design, all cars i like.	1
	it's a good looking car, but no chrysler 300.                                it would be best to market it as a sporty alternative to totota avalon/buick lucerne.	1
	if you did that, you could get 30-40k a year.	1
	if everything broke right.	1
	i'd expect about the same number sold as azera.	1
	azera would lose some buyers to it, but some wouldn't move up over $30k.	1

	in fact, i am hard pressed to think of a car with more than 300hp that does not offer awd as an option other than jaguar and the 7-series.	1
	i think it will be hard to compete in this segment without offering awd as an option.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/647#msg647i like that suggestion        living in northern utah, awd would be very welcome.	1
	i would like that option as well.	1
	i have never had a awd but have found myself wishing i had one on several occasions.	1
	between the fwd and the rwd, however, i would take a rwd just for the feel and handling even though it will probably do worse in snowy conditions.	1
	since hyundai already makes awd vehicles, it shouldn't be that hard to implement in the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/648#msg648re: i like that suggestion [ricwhite]        do they have a f-r setup for awd though?	1
	they have a f-f awd system in the crossover suvs.	1
	in their framed suvs (sorento and one not imported to usdm) they have awd/4wd but that has a traditional transfer case.	1
	i'm sure they could come up with one though, or purchase one from another company.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/649#msg649re: i like that suggestion [paisan]        my bet is on there will be no awd option for genesis if hyundai kept the promise that the base v6 will start 'under' $30k.	1
	even at around $31k - $32k it will be too costly for them to derive the genesis platform for awd capability.	1
	this is basically a 5-series plus equivalent car at a sub 3-series price, something's got to give here.	1
	even hyundai can't perform miracles.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/658#msg658re: hyundai redesgned cars [ssangyong_cars]        fyi - the santa fe was only recently redesigned (a great redesign in that regard), and the azera (and the santa fe) may (should) get a facelift 09 (not that it needs one) but the redesign will follow its regular cycle.	1

	[ricwhite]        i love my azera and sonata lx however when someone posts fiction it amuses me no end.	1
	i have no doubt that in time hyundai will compete as an equal, almost there in some instances.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/665#msg665re: which m t issue?	1
	[derrelhgreen]        i just got mine friday.	1
	basically, it says the $10,000 difference in price is not really worth it for the small differences that were in favor of the lexus.	1
	i think the ability to have 3rd row seat, and that the handling on the hyundai was actually better (mt felt the electronic nannies on the lexus let the hyundai win) and the fact that it runs on regular gas were big items.	1
	no doubt the lexus was the more high end vehicle, but not enough to justify the difference in price.	1
	i suspect this is where hyundai is going with the genesis.	1
	it may not be quite the egual of the 5 series or similar cars, but it will be darn close and $10,000+ less.	1
	sort of like the azera and the avalon.	1
	the avalon is a great car, but the azera is sooo close and thousands less in dollars (and runs on regluar - yes, i know the avalon will run on regular, but that's not what toyata recommends apparently).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/666#msg666re: which m t issue?	1
	[jaymagic]        $10k different is not worth it to mt but apparently is to the many rx owners.	1
	to each of his/her own...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/667#msg667re: which m t issue?	1
	[louiswei]        rx will continue to outsell veracruz but product for product, veracruz is truly equal or better (tested back-to-back) than the rx.	1
	and for $11k less, it's a no-brainier.	1
	that said, all things being equal, most americans would prefer the rx because:                                reputation                badge                loyalty                brand equity                                above will take time to build for hyundai (and the new luxury brand), especially since the veracruz is brand new and few know about the fantastic vehicle.	1
	interesting to note, 73% would purchase the veracruz with the emblems/badges covered, while 52% would purchase when they find out it was hyundai.	1
	conclusion, it has nothing to do with the product (image and perception seem the more pressing issue) which obviously since hyundai has caught up to toyota and the likes, even lexus!!	1
	this bodes well for hyundai's perception.	1
	and check out the title to the press release, someone seems to be missing the party                                 http://www.strategicvision.com/press_release.php?pr=27        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/668#msg668re: which m t issue?	1
	[joe97]         obviously since hyundai has caught up to toyota and the likes, even lexus!!	1
	i wouldn't make the conclusion basing on this one comparo.	1
	remember, the veracruz is all new in 07' and the rx (and highlander) is on its way out.	1
	the new highlander will debut this fall with rx possibly coming next year as an 09'.	1
	basically what i am saying is...yes, you are right, hyundai has caught up to [the five year old] toyota and lexus.	1
	but with the new entries from toyota/lexus coming soon, hold the cigars...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/669#msg669re: which m t issue?	1
	[louiswei]        agreed.	1
	i just re-read what i posted...what i meant to say, hyundai can now be compared favorably against toyota with its portfolio.	1
	i am looking forward to see what the next rx will be like.	1
	i am getting an 08 highlander test vehicle in a few months so i will have a firsthand experience.	1
	i am not liking too much on the styling but we will see if improvements are made from the areas which lacked on the (soon-to-be) outgoing highlander.	1
	the one critical part on the highlander from the general public so far seems to be justifying the price difference with the rav4.	1
	(is it worth paying the premium?)	1
	let's see how the range will be priced.       	1

	[derrelhgreen]        while they favored the hyundai, mt is not that good at reviewing cars for reliability or cost.	1
	however, as owner of a 2007 azera limited, hyundai is better than lexus, infiniti or acura.	1
	i took six months of test drives and research to prove that to myself.	1
	however, hyundai better do something about gas mileage, the ride and name before they come out with the genesis.	1
	they really need to do a better marketing job, e.g.	1
	new 'division,' rather than just another hyundai.       	1

	you answered your own question; they didn't want to use the toyota label so they added a different brand name.	1
	they did not start separate stores at all dealerships.	1
	the local one has them in the same store.	1
	hyundai should use a different name for the ultimate genesis.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/684#msg684re: new dealerships [floridabob1]        never said that scion was a luxury brand.	1
	only suggested that since hyundai already has the azera and veracruz as top hyundais and also a full line of kia's, it may be time for them to really take on toyotoa, nissan and honda by using the genesis to launch a separate line.	1
	remember, there was only one lexus to start with.	1

	obviously, hyundai wants to suck up all the money by introducing the new luxury model in early december.	1
	however it all depends if its workers can do without a strike until then.	1
	unfortunately, they are on strike now due to a political reason (anti-fta).	1
	i believe they will do again soon for a wage increase from the current level ($us 60k).	1
	its worker union is notorious for hardliners.	1
	they have had general strikes every year during the last twenty years regardless the company has a hard time in revenue or how important a new model is to them.	1

	fwiw, hyundai has experience in the trucking business and currently has at least one production vehicle underpins a truck platform (sold on us soil) so i tend to think it's more of feasibility issue than anything.	1
	it's a big investment and there are a lot of risks and uncertainties involved, a lot.       	1

	hyundai designers nixed the original genesis designs, so these are the first photos we've seen of the redesign.	1
	hyundai previewed the genesis at the new york international auto show.	1
	the interior shots reveal a host of changes and we've included photos of the original design, taken in 2005, to give you an idea of what's been modified.	1
	in addition to the control knob, you can see the large navigation display, the heavily revised gauges (incorporating electroluminescent dials) and wood-trimmed steering wheel with a different center design.	1
	the entire center console is slightly different, as well it's likely that the model you're looking at is a very high-end model, given the navigation, wood wheel and, apparently, ventilated seats.	1
	as for the exterior changes: the new prototype's grille is now trapezoidal instead of the original round-cornered                rectangle.	1
	the new grille slats are no longer vertical - they're horizontal like the concept - but there appear to be five                thin chrome slats, instead of the three thick slats marking the show car's face.	1
	the concept grille's distinctive notch above the hyundai badge isn't exactly visible on this prototype, but the camouflage is probably hiding it.	1
	the new car's headlights are more pointed, and they stretch well back along the fenders, again mimicking the shape of genesis show car's lights.	1
	the lights on this prototype are far more conventional, however, eschewing the concept's neon border surrounding thin led strip lights.	1
	the production car's front bumper has been similarly toned down, with more conventional fog lamps integrated with a more rounded lower air-intake.	1
	the profile of the genesis hasn't really been altered since the first prototype, but the newest prototype showcases a shark-fin gps or satellite radio antenna plunked on the roof line, something that has become almost a staple of luxury cars.	1
	the tail-lights were too covered to see how much of the genesis concept has made it onto the production car, but the wheels on which this prototype was riding look just like the nine-spoked wheels used on the show car.       	1

	for $30k you could get an audi a4 front wheel drive 4 cylinder and i don't even know what options you'll get.	1

	the genesis will have rear wheel drive and a 300 hp v6 and 380 hp v8 with many standard features that will compete with the bmw 5 series that goes for around $45-50k and the mercedes e-class which starts at $50k.	1

	for all i know it could be real.	1
	the genesis should be 40 to 50k in korea.	1
	however this car won't skimp on tech toys.	1
	things like lg cf based navigation with a mmi like interface, xm navtraffic, bluetooth, lazer cruise control, electric handbrake, infinity discrete logic7 surround and more.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/756#msg756genesis        i see from the spy shot that they have eliminated the rear side quarter window compared to the azera.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/757#msg757genesis        here's how i see it....                                hyundai might just have a winner with the genesis if they don't make a few key mistakes.	1
	1. they truly need to keep msrp around low 30k for the v8 version.	1
	if they price this car too high they will alot of potential buyers.	1
	this is a big step for hyundai and it is important in my opinion to get this car out and in the hands of buyers to show the world they do belong.	1
	2. as far as the interior goes, either use real wood or none at all.	1
	i high end car doesn't need fake wood trim, it truly cheapens the look of a car.	1
	i see these two point paramount to genesis sucess.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/758#msg758classic blunder        the azera is being marketed, sold, as a budget luxury car, not a mazima/avalaon/taurus competitor.	1
	now the will have a genesis to totally drain azera sales.	1
	so hyundai can't build on their volume, which is their main goal, to crest 500k.	1
	they keep producing additional vehicles, and they only gleen sales off other hyundais.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/764#msg764re: classic blunder [drfill]        no the azera will not be worthless, the azera will be priced below that of a genesis (an azera starts msrp below $25k well below what a base genesis will start at).	1
	not to mention that both cars are very distinct appealing to two different groups of people.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/765#msg765$40,000 should not be a problem        if you look at the other rear wheel drive luxury cars on the market, it seems that they could easily charge $40,000 for a genesis with the v8 and other fancy features.	1
	i just used edmunds to price a loaded chrysler 300c, and it came out to an msrp of $41,100 (yes, i know a 300c can be had for the invoice price, and i suspect that it will not be difficult to obtain a hyundai for the invoice price, since it is a totally new vehicle, and a new market for them).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/766#msg766re: classic blunder [snakeweasel]                        azera is $25k-28k.	1

	the azera ltd ultimate has a current list price of 31k plus                hyundai has yet to introduce the genesis, no less price it.	1
	hyundai is not proud to have to discount it's current flagship model to current levels.	1
	lexus never experienced that situation.	1
	the initial press talk indicated a guess that the 'loaded' price would be about 40k.	1
	if the car is a great success the price cutting will be minimal.	1
	if the car does not appeal to luxury buyers,they will give them away.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/768#msg768re: classic blunder [drfill]         azera is $25k-28k.	1
	sonata v6 limited is $25k.	1
	sure the sonata limited is the top of the line and fully optioned is slightly above the base azera with no options.	1
	but the sonata starts at $17k, well below that of the least expensive azera.	1
	the azeras to price will be about the genesis least expensive price point.	1
	so to be totally honest hyundai will only be offering one car in the $25-30k range as the vast majority of sonatas will be sold for under $25k and most genesis will go for over $30k leaving only the azera.	1
	veracruz isn't exactly seeing a stampede                                that begs the question of what is the veracruz sales volume verses the projected volume.	1

	v8 starts at 35k and on up to 42k with options.	1
	well see.	1
	i believe even a low featured v6 genesis is technically 'better' than a fully loaded azera.	1
	it makes sense that it must start at around 30k to set it apart from the lower-class vehicle.	1
	once that price point is set, then we go up from there.	1
	it doesn't make sense that people expect the genesis to be priced at the same level as an azera.	1
	loaded azeras can eclipse 30k.	1
	there's no way the v6 genesis will be that low.	1
	and forget about the v8 version anywhere within 10k of the azera.	1
	just not realistic.	1
	i'm an azera owner and looking at maybe upgrading to a genesis.	1
	but i'm sure that once pricing is released, i will be priced out.	1
	even the stripped v6 genesis will probably be several thousand dollars more than a fully loaded azera and i certainly wouldn't want a stripped genesis.	1
	so, i don't think the genesis is aimed at azera owners; rather, it is aimed at a higher market that hyundai currently doesn't attract.	1
	yes, the lowly school teacher may be able to afford an azera, but i believe hyundai is aiming for lawyers and executives with the genesis.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/779#msg779re: genesis pricing [ricwhite]        in my opinion, if someone wants a luxury car, they want some luxury features, not a stipped down model.	1

	v8 starts at 35k and on up to 42k with options.	1
	i'm sorry but if hyundai sets these prices the genesis will fail...  just my humble opinion.	1
	doctors, lawyers, executives are not the target buyers for this car, or shouldn't be, at least not off the bat.	1
	these professionals are too status driven and they are your typical audi, bmw, mercedes buyers.	1
	i think if hyundai is sucessful in 2-3 yrs they might be able to get those prices, not off the bat, they are not proven producers in the luxury sports sedan market.	1
	it will be interesting to see what happens.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/783#msg783re: genesis pricing [101649]        i really don't think thats the case simply because all those brands have entry level cars in the $30k range.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/787#msg787re: genesis pricing [101649]         if you can find one of those new ~$30k,                                most of those brands have their entry level cars at around $30k.	1
	up until the 2008 model year caddies came in at under $30k.	1
	bmw's start at around $32k, jag $34k, benz just over $31k volvo has 4 models under $30k (3 starting under 25k) and lexus has 2 models under $31k.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/788#msg788re: genesis pricing [101649]        just a few corrections:                                - infiniti's entry model is the g35, not m35.	1
	the g35 starts around $32k                                - jaguar's entry model is the x-type, not s-type.	1
	- lexus' entry model is the is250, not es350.	1
	the is250 starts around $32k                                - volvo's entry model is the s40 (which will be dropped with the s60 taking over that slot), not s80.	1
	most luxury entry models start around low $30k and top out around low $40k.	1
	a loaded lexus' is350 can be around very high $40k and the 3-series, as well as the c-class all top out at low/mid $50k range.	1
	i think the genesis will be very competitive if hyundai price it at low $30k and tops out (loaded with v8 and navi) at mid $40k.	1
	it'll be even better if it comes with a different badge but so far i don't see that happening.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/789#msg789re: genesis pricing [caraddict2]        the genesis will succeed if the marketing does not become exceedingly ambitious.	1
	let the status seekers have their 'badges'.	1
	hyundai must seek out those such as myself looking to be in the market for a $25k to $35 decent car, which this appears to be if hyundai lives up to its initial promise of an 'under $30,000 v6'.	1
	for me, this car becomes the 'perfect car' if they add a lane departure warning system.	1
	from what i have read, there are many single chip options out there to combine many features economically such as lane departure warning with adaptive cruise control and other computer based options.	1
	if genesis goes for the market i describe, (think today's american economy with interest rates due to drop to possibly 3% in 3 to 6 months) the opportunity to grab a large middle income market share is enormous.       	1

	allow me to be the first to mention that the genesis roll out date may now be as early as april 2008. according to the chosunilbo news in korea, hyundai is launching a $150 million ad campaign in the u.s. aimed at 'upgrading the carmaker's image in the u.s. and hopefully stimulating sales of the                 premium genesis sedan, due to roll out in april                .'	1
	this is the first i've heard such an early release date promised for the genesis, but the sooner it gets here the better, in my opinion.	1
	this car, if it's as good as they are promising, has the potential to shake the auto world like the first ls400 did almost 2 decades ago.       	1

	[dborth]        with a separate luxury dealer network, the genesis will be in the mix with the 5-series, e-class, gs and m. without it'll be compared to the such like chrysler 300 or even possibly the new rwd impala.	1
	the reason why the ls400 is such a 'hit' almost 20 years ago not only because it compares well to the s-class for almost half the price but also due to the introduction of the lexus brand.	1
	looking back of lexus' short 18-year history i can say that the ls400 wouldn't be 'it' with a toyota badge.	1
	hyundai has to decide if they want short-term or long-term success.	1

	the chrysler 300 is a one-in-a-million success story, and most are bought below $30k.	1
	the design is what sells that car.	1

	they want to sell it as a great car, which it may be.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/811#msg811hyundai needs premium brand        while i am anxiously anticipating the launch of the new bh (or whatever it will be called) i am also still very skeptical that hyundai badges on either the bh or new tib will have the desired effect of lifting the brand further up the market ladder and increase market share.	1
	all the collective brain trust at hyundai must realize that no matter whether they spend $150.00 or 150 million that a hyundai in the minds of the average buyer means 'an affordable, well built car'.	1
	thats all the currency it has.	1
	now if they are really serious about upselling in the premium market they had better create a separate new brand and dealer network for these cars.	1
	thinking they can push their premium cars under the current hyundai brand is not sustainable.	1
	they grossly underestimate the american consumer and the rules of market branding if they believe they can successfully move significant numbers of their soon to be released genesis models under their current 'value' brand.	1
	the best argument for hyundai to create a separate dealer network is their current struggles to hit 550,000 unit sales.	1
	currently, sales in the u.s. have pretty much hit a wall at 455,520 unit sales as they have tried to gain market share.	1
	more signs of their struggles is the apparent revolving door at hyundai north america's corporate with the recent exit of their coo, steve wilhite, who failed to deliver the numbers that hyundai unrealistically set for the u.s. market.	1
	he among other departed executives are among the casualties of this foolish ill fated bullrush to challenge the entrenched asian market market leaders.	1
	in my opinion, hyundai is pressing too hard too fast to catch the two major players, toyota and honda.	1
	while i would like to see them succeed with the bh and tiburon, their focus should more on doubling the sales of their elantra, sonata and santa fe models.	1
	however, without a premium brand, hyundai's drive to build even greater market share in the u.s. will be hindered and could stall.       	1

	honda still is not there with any (rwd-v8) upscale sedan above the accord to include the acura rs.	1
	20 years ago when the big v8 rwd ls  q's were launched, toy/niss did so with seperate single brand dealer networks.	1
	hyundai can't pull that off in todays economic climate.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/817#msg817genesis appears generic        although i'm very interested in the genesis, it will need to have 'wow' factor in order to succeed.	1
	it has an uphill battle because of name association and it will have to be 'cutting-edge' in design and function.	1
	sadly, the unique design of the concept version has seemingly been changed for the production version to the drab 'same-old' generic design features we have all seen before.	1
	although styling hasn't fully been revealed, what has been revealed appears to be nothing special at all.	1
	thus far, i see no 'wow' factor at all in the design.	1
	i guess it's really no surprise since hyundai is known for conservatism with design in past models.	1
	the azera (which i drive) is a rather plain generic design as are all of the other sedans in the line-up.	1
	however, when i saw the drawing of the genesis concept, i had hope that things might change.	1
	alas, it appears not.	1
	too bad.	1
	as far as function is concerned, it appears the features and technology for the genesis will be pretty generic fare for  a basic luxury car.	1
	nothing has been revealed thus far that would cause much excitement.	1
	the most promising aspect of the vehicle is probably the new v8 engine (hopefully more efficient than the v6 engine currently in the azera).	1
	but even that is not something that will separate it from the other cars it's supposedly competing with.	1
	as of now (fall, 2007) i see the genesis as a conservative and fairly generic basic luxury car and, unfortunately, that will not be enough to lift it above the cars in its class that have had many years of refinement and proven track records.	1
	i am anxiously waiting to see and hear more about the genesis and hope there are some surprises yet to be revealed that will turn heads and raise eyebrows.	1
	i still have the genesis on my short list of cars to consider as an upgrade to my azera some time in 2008.                        	1

	the elantra .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	rather than having to justify the purchase of anything else, i really need to justify in my own mind the purchase of our 2007 camry.	1
	the purchase was based upon my excellent experiences with toyota products beginning with my 1968 corona; however, this purchase was a big mistake on my part.	1
	few posters on edmunds.com own a honda, hyundai, and toyota simultaneously, but our family is one, and objectively, the hyundai takes a back seat to no one as 'an affordable, well- built car' - with emphasis placed on well-built.	1
	honda and toyota proponents are analogous to apple owners - they feel that no other quality computer (or, car in this scenario) exists.	1
	such is not the case.	1
	that being said, regardless how good the genesis is, or will be, it will have tough sledding if sold at a hyundai-specific store.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/831#msg831re: more pics [ricwhite]        re: 831                i would believe that if the genesis is to be introduced for the 08 model year, the specifications for production models has been finalized for some time.	1
	if hyundai desired to have a separate dealer network for genesis the franchises would have been awarded, and buildings would presently be under construction.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/833#msg833re: more pics [floridabob1]        whoever told you it was 4.7l v8 doesn't know what they are talking about.	1
	the tau family of engines features 4.6, 5.0 and 5.5                                no official hp ratings but expect anywhere from 340-380.  v6 will be around 300.       	1

	no reason for the hostility.	1
	i believe that the hyundai rep. stated that the v6 will have the same hp as the azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/835#msg835re: more pics [floridabob1]        i have been told the bh v6 should house under its hood the second generation of the lambda engine (higher hp / improved fuel economy) with                 direct injection                .	1
	as such, i highly doubt it'd feature the same hp as the azera - would be disappointed if it has the same horsepower as the azera.       	1

	g8 pricing has just been announced for the following specs.	1
	base: 3.6 v-6, 261hp, 5-speed auto starting                $27,595.	1
	'gt'; 6.0 v-8, 362hp, 6-speed auto starting                $29,995.	1
	realizing the g8 is a much smaller fwd sedan than the future rwd genesis, and will certainly appeal to a different buyer i thought the above specs/pricing interesting.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/838#msg838uh..........        the g8 is rwd.	1
	and it is as big as the genesis will be!	1

	sorry to have to break it to you......                                we will see how the genesis compares to the g8.	1

	rwd, i invite                 dr. shrill                to read the following:                                'in fact, the new g8 is actually smaller (but a bit heavier) than the outgoing grand prix, and substantially smaller than its main rear-drive competition: the dodge charger.	1
	the pontiac gives up about 4 inches in overall body length and almost 6 inches in wheelbase to the dodge--a difference that could have a detrimental effect on ride quality.'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/840#msg840the g8        is 196+ inches long, offers 39+ inches of rear legroom, and gives you 360+hp for under $30k.	1
	can the genesis do that?	1
	drfill        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/841#msg841genesis name        there is a very good chance that the genesis name will be used on the production bh.	1
	there were some other names but those names aren't as good.	1
	bh is the codename for the genesis.	1
	hyundai uses a 2 digit letter code for their cars.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/843#msg843release date        sales manager at local dealership told me rep. advised him that they will probably not get genesis before oct. 08.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/844#msg844re: release date [floridabob1]        re 844   and, you believe this?	1
	while i have never had the misfortune of encountering a 'hyundai rep', the dealer salespeople including 'managers' i have encountered can't remember what they had for dinner last night.	1
	why would hyundai launch an '08 in the fall when competition is introducing '09's?	1
	the southeast us would be the last to receive anything from korea, obviously.	1
	we can always start a pool.	1
	i'm guessing my local inept dealer will have their's 04/08.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/845#msg845re: release date [dborth]        re: 845                i would believe that if the car is released at any point after the first quarter of 08, it will come out as an 09.                by the way, i can't remember what i had for dinner tonight.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/846#msg846re: uh.......... [dborth]        the g8 is larger on the inside and has a larger trunk than the charger - it is a very space-efficient design.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/847#msg847re: genesis name [rv65]        the other rumored names are echelon, talus, zeta, geneva and toscana.	1
	i think it will be called the genesis since people really liked the genesis name.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/848#msg848re: the g8 [drfill]        to cut corners and costs, gm omitted several features i would consider to be mistakes - navigation, memory seats, bluetooth, hid, to name a few.	1
	yes, i know the g8 will perform well on the track, but the packaging counts just as much.	1
	granted, it's not exactly competing on the luxury side like the bh but more on the sport end.	1
	regardless, both should make it through and to my short list coming shopping next year.	1
	is 196+ inches long, offers 39+ inches of rear legroom, and gives you 360+hp for under $30k.	1
	can the genesis do that?	1
	yes (length), yes (rear legroom), and we don't know the pricing for the bh yet but speculated horsepower is anywhere between 340-380 for the v8, and around 300 on the v6.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/849#msg849re: the g8 [joe97]        as for navigation onstar and bluetooth onstar played a role in that.	1
	gm wants you running onstar hands free and gps instead of having a factory installed one.	1
	i hope gm finally realises that having factory installed navs and bluetooth could allow them to have more sales.	1
	gm offers them on suv's but not really any cars.	1
	well maybe caddy, corvette, buick, minivans, and thats probably it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/850#msg850re: the g8 [joe97]        good news - there is no need to allow the lack of factory navigation and bluetooth affect your choice of a vehicle.	1
	i installed a pioneer avic-z1 in my 2006 explorer, and it has the bluetooth module, xm radio (with navtraffic), and a rear view camera.	1
	with four excellent speakers, the whole system cost about $2,500.       	1

	[derrelhgreen]        veracruz, santa fe, and azera will get a touch screen navigation system.	1
	it will be similar to the one in the usdm bh but will have a single disc cd/dvd/mp3 player and all the goodies that hyundai radios have.	1
	no bluetooth.	1
	also the 2009 sonata will get the lg touch screen navigation system.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/858#msg858re: new interior pics.	1
	[derrelhgreen]        i doubt the computer knob will be removed.	1
	some car interiors are a little bit uncomfortable to touch the screen due to the high mounting of the screen.	1
	the knob makes it easier to control a high mounted screen.	1
	this car is way way too far in the rd stage to have it removed.	1
	it's going into production next year for the us.	1
	korea is getting it earlier.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/866#msg866emblem        the emblem on the spyshots is the official emblem.	1
	it looks like the usdm version will get the kdm love.	1
	the hyundai emblem might be present on the outside but the inside will get the korean equus/dynasty emblem.	1
	the bh will in the us won't get the wood filled dash.	1
	the dash will have leather specs but fake aluminum could be possible.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/867#msg867dealer convention        this car is going to debut this year for korea/international market.	1
	hyundai had a dealer convention some days ago.	1
	this convention showed the bk, bh, and elantra touring.	1
	the bk and bh were fully undisguised.	1
	people who attended that convention say they are great cars.	1
	i'm sure edmunds would want to go to this convention but they can't due to them being the press.	1
	the bk is the new rwd hyundai coupe that has been rumored for a while.	1
	there is a possibility of the bk sharing the final production bh's name.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/868#msg868re: dealer convention [rv65]         there is a possibility of the bk sharing the final production bh's name                                thanks for the info.	1
	this is interesting, it makes senses to call the bk by whatever bh ends up with, since bk is in essence the coupe version of the bh, at least sharing the same platform.	1
	on the other hand, i know a lot has been made this would be the tib replacement (in theory true, but it is rwd vs. fwd, and the fact another fwd coupe will slot in, borrowing heavy cues from the veloster concept), and tib has a good following, but then i can't help think the obvious increase in price over the tib.	1
	/rant                                in the end, i think it is better to call it by whatever the bh ends up with.	1
	we shall find out soon...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/869#msg869no azera for '08?	1

	why would anybody buy an azera, if this car is so great, and they're within a couple of grand anyway?	1
	hyundai seems ready, willing, and able to keep cannibalizing it's own sales.	1
	and they say they want to sell 550k a year (now their goal is down to 510k), but they sell higher priced cars, that hurt each other, and fail to bring in new business.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/871#msg871re: no azera for '08?	1
	[derrelhgreen]        there will be an 08 azera.	1
	it will be coming out eventually though.	1
	hyundai confirmed a press release but no details on production.	1
	it must be in production by now.	1
	a touch screen lg navigation system will be available with a 605w audio system.	1

	[drfill]         why would anybody buy an azera, if this car is so great, and they're within a couple of grand anyway?	1
	why not?	1
	there is very little overlap, if any, between the azera and the bh.	1
	fwd vs. rwd                v6 vs. more powerful v6 and even more powerful v8                and if you think the power rear-sunshade is representation of near luxury appointments inside the azera, then the bh will crossed the luxury categories with ease.	1
	should i keep going?	1
	further, stop infecting every board with sales propoganda and ignorant posts about hyundai.	1
	the whole market is down, and not just hyundai.	1
	and about the millionth times, strikes, strong won, and other factors have greatly affected production, not something a lot of other makers have had to deal with.	1

	what is this?	1
	again you are speculating and going way off-base here.	1
	i've posted at least three different reasons why there is almost no overlapping between the azera and bh.	1
	so...unless you've already lived in the future, or have driven either, (and no on both accounts), you are widely speculating and posting your 'hyundai automatically equals bad' biased comments.	1
	you seem to think luxury can be applied with a sunshade.	1
	reading what i actually posted would help before the above response.	1
	keeping the forum balanced?	1
	your anti-hyundai (pro toyota/lexus) posts are so much balanced...when was the last time you posted one ounce of good thing about hyundai?	1
	right, didn't think so.	1
	if i didn't know any better, hyundai should be out of business, just by reading your posts.	1
	------                                i come here to check out the spy photos, to ask questions, to discuss about the latest news re: bh, courtesy of rv65 and many others.	1
	i am sure most others are as well.	1
	as a consumer and a prospective bh customer, i really don't care about sales figures, or whatever propaganda you have with your anti-hyundai agenda.	1
	i am buying a car that best suits my needs, how the automakers do certainly take a back seat.	1
	anyway, i am asking you nicely to stop infecting every forum with your virus.	1
	you've already been called out quite a few times in other places - it's time to give a rest about your agenda.	1
	a lot of other members here and i would really like to get back to the bh if we may.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/879#msg879and why is it drfill can rant on about        how hyundai is the biggest waste of anyone's money and that they should always be sheeping along and buying a toy/lex, and the good doctor's posts don't get removed?	1
	even though he's trolling and catching quite a few complaints along the way?	1
	i know the internet highway is free and open but drfill complete's the definition of an internet troll.	1
	seen it for about 8 years now and it is the same way it looked in the late 90's when i was just getting started on cars on the internet.	1
	anyway, i was just wondering, do the hosts like the real dr.phil?	1
	and they think that a car internet chat drfill is almost as soothing as the real dr.phil?	1
	i mean, this is a thread solely about the 2008-2009 hyundai genesis.	1
	not toyota and lexus, yet he points his fishing boat squarely at those fishing in hyundai luxury rwd v8 waters.	1
	and collides head-on with several boats.	1
	and this is just fine?	1
	i think the good doc fears hyundai with their new genesis and he's here to steer y'all back to toy/lex-land(as if you really wanted to head there anyway, eeek!!!	1
	)quickly before you learned what a great deal you will get on your new genesis in the near future.	1
	it's not all about buying the same luxury car your rich uncle bought and speels on about.	1
	some people are interested in a luxury car that is also a great deal with a great long-haul warranty.	1
	hyundai is building a vehicle that will produce rich results for them, imho.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/880#msg880re: no azera for '08?	1
	[drfill]        no, i'm not at the wrong forum.	1
	you are.	1
	the whole purpose of you being around hyundai forums is to bash.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/881#msg881lwb model and name        even though hyundai hasn't confirmed it this could be the equus in korea but it's most likely going to be the dynasty replacement.	1
	the lwb bh codenamed vi will probably replace the korean mitsubishi derived equus.	1
	this car will most likely be named genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/882#msg882re: and why is it drfill can rant on about [iluvmysephia1]        once the new word on toyota's slip in reliability from cr filters down to the general populace, thereby affecting toyota's sales, i think some posters who have always had an anti-hyundai bias on edmunds will become more objective.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/883#msg883i don't get you guys        the only ones bringing up toyota, or lexus, is you.	1

	the only news you've delivered is your spite for hyundai.	1
	it doesn't matter anyway - this isn't a hyundai general talk forum, this is the bh thread.	1
	this isn't a sales forum, this isn't a hyundai vs. toyota/lexus.	1
	post your propaganda elsewhere, or start a new forum if you want to continue your rant.	1
	i don't remember the beginning of this forum but more recently, everyone has been posting bh related info (keyword bh related info) and having normal discussions about the bh (again keyword being the bh), until somewhere asked a perfectly fine question about the availability of the 08 azera, and you had to provoke with your usual hyundai propaganda.	1
	few cares in here but most would like you to stop and take it elsewhere.	1

	what's to discuss?	1
	hyundai has the cash, but doesn't have the guts, to challenge luxury marques with this car, so they hedge their bet.	1
	that is a topic for discussion, and it definitely involves the bs.....i mean bh.	1
	sorry.	1
	this is just for you - you will be very surprised when the bh comes out.	1
	i'm not gonna care when it's out.	1
	why would i care?	1
	my job is to make sure the casual buyer that stops by here for information isn't led blindly into thinking this car is something it isn't.	1
	it is a hyundai.	1
	that's all it is!	1

	saying it like a true basher.	1
	so if this is the reason you are here, and if you are serving your 'duty', then you should be visiting all forums, and not just hyundai ones.	1
	what else is new?	1
	if you wouldn't mind, i would really like to get back to, and gather get more info about the bh as it approaches unveiling.	1
	in case you hadn't notice, this forum serves the same purpose just like any other future cars forums, people looking to find out more info.	1
	next time if you are accusing false info posted here, then provide examples please, instead of being all talks.	1
	all of your content so far are: hyundai can't compete, hyundai can't compete, hyundai can't compete.	1
	that ought to sum it up.	1
	and, nothing about the bh.	1
	what else is new.	1
	keep trolling.	1
	there is a difference between getting suspicious and being so sure by passing off as facts.	1
	again, i'd be more than happy to set you guys up.	1
	and once again, you are selecting the comparos in your interest and ignoring those you don't want to believe they are true.	1
	to you, hyundai is always bottom-feeder.	1

	or are we still ducking sand being tossed in our face from the good doctor?	1
	i am excited about the new hyundai genesis and i think that hyundai will continue to show the same prowess that they have been showing the last 5 or 6 years, winning awards for initial quality and finally starting to win over some tough nuts at cr for building great vehicles.	1
	their fine manufacturing and building progress is being noticed and is selling.	1
	remember how long they've been at this compared to toy/hon/nis, etc.	1
	this new genesis is different, a v8 rwd luxury car.	1
	we've been told that it will sell at reasonable prices, too.	1
	sounds like a recipe for success from hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/902#msg902re: anybody know anything new about the hyundai [iluvmysephia1]        i posted this in the 'is there any room for hyundai in the luxury market' discussion board.	1
	hopefully the response applies here.	1
	let me know if i messed up on any of the items below:                                let's talk what we know.	1
	the key features on the production-ready concept version should carry over to the production version:                                advanced adaptive cruise control                all of hyundai standard safety features                heat / cool seats                high intensity discharge (hid) headlamps with adaptive leveling                push-button start                navigation with backup camera                electric parking brake                bluetooth technology                usb / auxiliary input jack                hd radio receiver                xm satellite radio  infinity discrete surround audio system                                 it will offer more than one type of suspension, allowing buyers to choose the one that best meets their needs.	1
	there was a spy shot, and on the nav screen, it showed the leveling of the car, which seemed to indicate something along the lines of height adjustable suspension - we shall wait and see since it was a korean spec mule.	1
	i've also heard talks of xm navtraffic but that is remained to be seen.	1
	here is the hd radio press release:                                 hyundai to offer hd radio receiver on future premium sports sedan                                    new york, april 4, 2007  hyundai will continue to stay on the leading edge of automotive technology by offering hd radio on its rear-wheel drive premium sports sedan scheduled for introduction in 2008.                                    in 2005, hyundai broke an industry barrier by announcing it would be the first automaker to standardize satellite radio in all of our vehicles, said john krafcik, vice president of strategic planning and product development, hyundai motor america.	1
	by adding the option of hd radio reception to our new premium sports sedan we will continue to provide hyundai customers with the latest digital technology to enhance the driving experience.	1
	more than 1200 am and fm stations, available to approximately 80 percent of the u.s. population, are using hd radio technology to transmit digital audio and data to their listeners.	1
	consumer benefits of hd radio broadcasting include:                                    * across the country, 550 hd2 multicast channels on the fm dial offer additional, subscription-free content that can only be heard with an hd radio receiver.	1
	these channels feature fresh new music and news formats, showcase young artists and local bands, air non-english language programming, and more.	1
	* crystal-clear, static-free reception                  * cd-quality fm stations                  * fm-stereo quality sound am stations                  * text display on an lcd screen including: artist names, song titles, weather and traffic alerts, school closings, sports scores, etc.	1
	* best of all, there are no fees associated with hd radio programming.	1
	http://www.ibiquity.com/press_room/news_releases/2007/1008                                currently only bmw offers hd radio as factory-installed options; jaguar and hyundai to join the party soon.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/911#msg911re: adjustable suspension [jeansyc]        one of the recent spy shots of a korean mule indicated height-adjusted suspension on the navigation screen.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/912#msg912re: adjustable suspension [jeansyc]        also the navigation, audio, ac, and other features are controlled by a knob.	1

	concept genesis coupe will make its world debut at the 2007 los angeles international auto show on wednesday november 14th, the korean automaker said.	1
	'concept genesis coupe hints at design direction for a future rear-wheel drive sports coupe from hyundai,' a press release read.	1
	the car will be based on hyundai's bh rear-wheel-drive platform.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/916#msg916sketch        that sketch of the coupe will probably be about as accurate as the sketch they had of the concept genesis.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/917#msg917re: sketch [ricwhite]        the concept sketch you posted does correspond to the                 concept                model previewed at 07 nyias.	1
	hyundai has indicated long while ago the production model will be somewhat different from the concept but relatively similar in the overall shape, execution and styling.	1
	right off the bat, you know the front lights and fog lights weren't to be made into production...                                this is not the first time a concept from an auto manufacturer looks somewhat different than the production model - that's why it's called concept vehicles.	1
	regardless, it's hard to make a definitive judgment with the camo on, let's wait until the production model is revealed.	1

	the genesis would be the lexus level of hyundai's lineup.	1
	what they said: 'this is not just a concept car,' said steve wilhite, chief operating officer of hyundai motor america.	1
	'it's really a fast-forward journey into the future of the hyundai brand.'	1
	what they didn't say: the first lexus ls was a screaming bargain that trumped everything else in the premium segment on price and features.	1
	a lexus is no longer such a bargain, but the genesis would be a lexuslike bargain with a wide array of standard features, if hyundai sticks to the promises made here in terms of performance and price.	1
	what makes it tick?	1
	genesis, a rear-wheel-drive sedan, will feature hyundai's first v-8 engine; horsepower output is promised to be 'well over 300.'	1
	how much, how soon?	1
	second half of 2008, with a promised price 'well under $30,000.'	1
	well, well.	1
	how's it look?	1
	bigger than the lexus gs, smaller than the ls, the photogenic genesis in person looks more like the current toyota camry from the front, a nissan maxima from the side a buick from behind.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/925#msg925to recap...        what do we know so far:                                v6 - all but confirmed 300hp (the coupe will defn.	1
	have 300hp afaik).	1
	v8 - rumored anywhere from 340 to 380 horses                                lots and lots of features.	1
	anything else missed?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/926#msg926re: to recap... [joe97]        re 926                 'v8 - rumored anywhere from 340 to 380 horses'                                340hp is a deal killer, to 'me too' and chasing hemi 340's.	1
	hp is cheap at the point of manufacturing related to consumer acceptance at product launch.	1
	in 2002 hyundai 'mis-stated' hp claims on several models resulting in the loss of a class action suit in the us.	1
	i suppose they could always mis-state again, on the high side.	1
	i'll take more hp and less 'features'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/927#msg927re: to recap... [dborth]        why let a state hp number rule your world?	1
	it is the end result (eg, performance) that matters.	1
	i don't care if a vehicle has 1000 hp if it doesn't perform.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/928#msg928re: to recap... [dborth]         i'll take more hp and less 'features'.	1
	not sure i would agree with you.	1
	for one you can have to much hp in a car, secondly as you increase hp every increase of 'x' hp results in a smaller increase of performance over the last 'x' increase.	1
	finally since there is almost always traffic in front of me why have all that hp that i will never use.	1
	i will take features with adequate hp.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/929#msg929# 928  # 929        for hyundai to launch a rwd/v8 will position genesis in an instand comparison with two competitive arenas, the hemi 300c-charger/g8 and the german/japan collections.	1
	hyundai will never 'out feature' gerpan at any price but could compete favorably in performance at a significant savings.	1
	my original point is that 340hp is old news, and g8 reflects that.	1
	there are 'features' in my azera i seldom if ever use, but i'm always inclined to compare product capability.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/930#msg930re: # 928  # 929 [dborth]        well, let's look at it this way ... let's say, just for the sake of throwing numbers out there, the g8 comes out to $32k for optioned out with 365hp (i think that was the last number i read) and can go 0-60 in 5.6 secs.	1
	would the genesis really be such a dog if it had 340hp, could run to 60 in 5.8 secs and, comparably equipped to the $32k g8, cost $28k?	1
	if you are the type of person who is so bothered by miniscule specs that come down to driver capability, then spend the extra $4k.	1
	personally, i could think of much better ways to spend $4k than for 2 tenths of a second.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/931#msg931re: # 928  # 929 [qbrozen]        exactly my sentiments.	1
	plus, the g8 is more of a track car, sport-oriented; while the bh/genesis focuses on luxury and peformance.	1
	the g8 left out a lot of key features to attack the luxury field, which is kind of my earlier point, but looks to be a great car nonetheless.	1
	the g8 and the bh each caters to different crowds.	1
	of course we should keep in mind the bh horspeower rating has not been annouced yet so we'll see when we see it                                so long as the v6 number (300hp) stays true, that will be more than sufficient for most, i'd imagine; the v8 adds an extra kick for sure.       	1

	do you really think $28k will buy the v-8?	1
	i'd love to have your crystal ball.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/933#msg933re: # 928  # 929 [dborth]        like i said, i was just throwing numbers out there.	1
	i didn't state anything was in stone.	1
	i asked a question of you, plain and simple.	1
	obviously, if the car comes to the table costing just as much with less performance, than it will fail.	1
	so i don't need to ask that question.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/934#msg934re: # 928  # 929 [qbrozen]        re: 934                if you are just throwing out numbers, you could use 30 k for a loaded v8 genesis.	1
	in my opinion, it doesn't make sense to just guess at a price.	1
	i believe that a loaded v8 will cost much more than 32k       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/935#msg935re: # 928  # 929 [floridabob1]        i could use $40k.	1
	???	1
	i just don't see how it changes my question.	1
	again, like i said, if it is cheaper than comparably equipped competitors, yet is a bit slower, what is the problem?	1
	i don't need to ask, 'hey, what if it costs the same and offers less performance?'	1
	because i know the answer to that question.	1
	ok, tell ya what, i'll edit the question as follows for those impaired by theoreticals:                                 would the genesis really be such a dog if it had 30 less horsepower and could run to 60 in 2 tenths of a second slower than a competitor you are considering, yet, comparably equipped to that competitor, cost $4k less?	1
	how about $3k less?	1
	what about $2k?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/936#msg936re: # 928  # 929 [qbrozen]        why don't we wait until hyundai prices the genesis in the various packages to make the decision if it's a good deal or not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/937#msg937well, you can stop guessing...        at least for the g8 because a loaded v8 gt will cost just $32,895.	1
	here is the pricing sheet:                                                i know the g8 is more leaning to the performance side versus the genesis is emphasizing more on the luxury.	1
	however, given that they are both rwd, v6 standard / v8 option and in similar price range, there should be little doubt that these two will be cross shopped by the buyers regularly.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/938#msg938re: well, you can stop guessing... [louiswei]        re 938:                 'i know the g8 is more leaning to the performance side versus the genesis is emphasizing more on the luxury.	1

	'cross shopped', i doubt it.	1
	i can't imagine the dweebs in korea were thinking about competeting with a                 pontiac                of all things when designing genesis.	1
	their egos where directed toward germany/japan.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/939#msg939re: well, you can stop guessing... [dborth]        re: 939                you're right in the fact that hyundai is not thinking about the pontiac buyer as their competition with the genesis.	1
	they are definitely looking for the buyers of the german and japanese models.	1
	you are also correct with your comment about their need to deal with problems in a better and more timely manner.	1
	they are doing a poor job in dealer improvement at all levels, facilities, sales and service.	1
	i am sure that there are some good dealers out there, but they appear to be few and far between.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/940#msg940re: # 928  # 929 [floridabob1]        oi vey!	1
	once again, for the third or fourth time, i am not guessing as to pricing.	1
	the original poster this stemmed from (dborth) was claiming that 340hp would be a deal killer for him.	1
	i am merely trying to ascertain why that would be the case when, in fact, we don't know any other details or how that will come out in the real world in terms of performance or pricing.	1
	i am asking that poster if.	1
	in other words, all i am saying is why make a decision that a lousy few hp kills a car when it may perform just as well or may be less expensive or may ... fill in the blank.	1
	try reading all the posts in order and this may make more sense to you.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/941#msg941re: # 928  # 929 [qbrozen]        re 941.  read my post again gbozen.	1
	i said 340 is                 old news, chasing the well positioned hemi's                .	1
	i never said a thing about performance.	1
	performance from hyundai is a given now.	1
	from a marketing standpoint, rwd-v8 is huge for hyundai.	1
	4-door sedan v8's from japan  germany are so far superior to those produced by the big 3 us it is safe to assume hyundai's will follow suit.	1
	to put it another way, the rumored 380hp will drive more people in to see genesis that won't bother if product launch hp is another me-too, same as chrysler and less than                 pontiac                                marketing 101 is bigger, faster, more, better.	1
	if you can get all that at a value price with the backing and confidence of a leading warranty.....bingo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/942#msg942re: # 928  # 929 [dborth]        and, as i said, basing opinion on a number like hp is silly.	1
	if that is what floats your boat, i suggest looking at a freightliner.	1
	and you only need to look at other competitions to know the score.	1
	infiniti offers more hp than bmw, yet it doesn't keep folks out of the bimmer showroom.	1

	lol!	1
	that's a memorable quote!	1
	i think the detroit unveiling will be filled with surprises for many of us anticipating this vehicle.	1
	by the way, i noticed that even though hyundai has stated that they do not intend to launch a premium brand, they have not dismissed it for the future.	1
	of course it is predicated with the words 'if'.	1
	if hyundai can establish a beach head in the u.s. and generate sufficient sales for both the bh coupe and sedan.	1
	this is the 'safe' way to play it but is it smart?	1
	maybe.	1
	on the one hand, they can cost-effectively launch and market premium vehicles through their existing value brand without the risk or required overhead of a separate premium channel like genesis.	1
	good for short term but in the long term, if they expect significant growth, they will need to separate these upmarket cars from the herd.	1

	so it might be that .	1
	maybe it could be another system.	1
	xm navtraffic is a possibility.	1
	actually it will be on it if you get the navigation system.	1

	first, your reaction to a single campaign of tv commercials is to say this about the sponsor:                                'i see a lot of ambition, but not a whole lot of talent, yet.'	1
	all carmakers -- all large companies, for that matter -- go outside for hired ad agencies to create their advertising.	1
	the people in whom you 'don't see a whole lot of talent' are probably a handful of agency hipsters in their 20s.	1
	they have absolutely nothing to do with the product.	1
	in fact, hyundai's us marketing chief has already concluded a much-publicized agency search and replaced the agency that developed that ad.	1
	there's already a new, completely different azera commercial on the air in its place; you ought to get out less.	1
	second, the points made ahead of your posts are documented facts.	1
	toyota did ask for a peek into hyundai's new alabama plant, and did get snubbed.	1
	and toyota's ceo has named hyundai as toyota's most threatening long-term 'enemy' (his word, not mine).	1
	hyundai may yet have 'a lot to prove, to me.'	1
	i'll settle for the opinion of this other fellow instead, thanks very much.	1
	finally, you say 'before we declare hyundai the second coming, can they build a best-in-class vehicle first?'	1
	by the sheerest coincidence, your prescient posts have been made on a board dedicated in part to the hyundai azera, recognized by this month's consumer reports as #1 in customer satisfaction (83% repurchase intent) in the large car class.	1
	it is also the editors' most wanted and editors' top recommended car in its class according to the proprietors of this board, edmunds, and was the #1-rated car in vehicle satisfaction by autopacific -- among all cars, regardless of class -- in its first year of production.	1

[bfriended]        i respectfully disagree with your disagreement                                i think the hyundai brand, while much better then the days of the 'excel', still has an economy image, and people don't realize they are now on par with toyota and honda, this is why people pay more for toyota  honda.	1
	i think by simply branding the car 'genesis', i think it will intrigue people to learn that hyundai made this masterpiece and increase hyundai's brand value, kind of a weird reverse way on how they introduced the lexus ls400, nowhere could you find the word ls400 on the car, or better yet how the nsx elevated acura.	1
	americans will pay more for a brand, that's why lexus, acura and infiniti only existed only in the us until recently.	1
	i remember reading something when the saturn sky was about to be released, they showed some panels the sky without any badges and it rated high, then they put a saturn badge on it and the ratings actually dropped.	1
	your statement says it all, why not pull up in a 'genesis' with the 'bentley-like badge' then tell them it's a hyundai, they won't believe you and create more buzz on the car, if they see the economy-looking h on the grill some people might even tell you you wasted your money (not me                so i am anticipating this car and would love to see my friends faces when i pull up in one and tell them it is a hyundai...       	1

	[dborth]        if i recall correctly, the azera is longer than both the e-class and 5er in overall length but not in regards of wheelbase.	1
	the genesis should be in line with the same comparo re: s-class  7er swb versions on the exterior.	1
	note the spec for genesis is based on the concept version (although the production should not vary much).	1
	interior-wise and usable space (passenger vol + trunk vol) is concerned, this is where hyundai shines:                                the azera is well ahead of both the e-class and 5er.	1

	hyundai didn't lie, they somehow did manage to get the genesis below $30k but it is indeed a curve ball since                 almost nobody                was expecting the 3.3 to be the base engine.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1089#msg1089re: dborth, what's with all the trash talk?	1
	where do i begin?	1
	so, the 'speculation or publicity' didn't mention that the base model would pack 264 horsepower in a 3.3l package.	1
	so what?	1
	the pre-release announcement did.	1
	hyundai reports the lineup accurately six months before it hits the showrooms, and you're portraying it as a credibility/integrity failure on their part because the online gossip mill got it wrong?	1
	hyundai is guilty of 'double-speak' for saying they benchmarked the e-class, infiniti m and lexus gs?	1
	they matched the feature list, matched the size, knocked off the styling and clobbered the price.	1
	what's the complaint here?	1
	that they're down 30 hp with the base engine?	1
	that's it?	1
	'now we have hp ratings based on grade of fuel?	1
	korean kurve ball.'	1
	in case you haven't noticed, every maker who says 'premium fuel only' is doing this.	1
	most of the cars would also run on regular, but their knock sensors would retard the timing, reducing horsepower.	1
	it's just that the luxury nameplates need the extra hp more for advertising and exclusivity purposes, and need the selling point of regular gas less.	1
	(example: the acura tl is rated for premium, while the outgoing accord v6 is nearly the same engine but is rated for regular, even though dyno tests prove it gains 10 hp with premium.)	1
	in addition, the new sae horsepower ratings knock down the numbers a few percent from the old ones -- a fact that has already been noted in numerous places, including these hyundai boards.	1
	i'm sorry you're unhappy with your hyundai.	1
	but if you have a legitimate case against hyundai, it should be sound enough that you can state it with true facts rather than the ones you're using now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1090#msg1090re: dborth, what's with all the trash talk?	1

	my 'case against hyundai', as you put it, has never been aimed at the vehicle, but rather their screwed up us marketing and 3rd world dealer network.	1
	then can 'benchmark' any competitive model they want, they have proven so far to be the best financed knock-off artist in the industry.	1

	it will keep the starting price down but offer plenty of power for those of us who don't need more power, but might like the styling and luxury touches of the car.	1
	i also agree the 3.3l will be a good base engine, since it will deliver decent performance and better fuel economy than the 3.8l.	1
	the .5l difference in displacement between the two v6's should make for a couple mpg difference.	1
	the base genesis 3.3l weighs 162 pounds more than the avalon xls (3,732 vs 3,570), has only 4 hp less than the avalon (264 vs 268 / both reg unleaded), and they both have 6spd automatics.	1
	considering the avalon's 0-60 mph time is around 6.0 to 6.2 seconds, the base genesis should pull off 0-60 in around 6.8 to 7.0 seconds.	1
	many sedan drivers consider that performance to be more than adequate.	1
	those used to driving something as quick as an avalon or a passat v6 would probably be very satisfied with the performance genesis 3.8l.	1
	i'm anticipating the professional track tests over the next couple months.       	1

	[dborth]        i don't know, but it really isn't relevant to this particular discussion.	1
	that's a question for the azera forum.	1
	this one is specifically for those interested in hyundai genesis and frankly, if you've already decided you aren't interested, there are probably better threads for you to post in than this one; for example... the other thread in which this conversation is taking place:                 mainstream large sedans comparison        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1100#msg1100re: can genesis  azera sell side by side?	1
	[dborth]        i'd say possibly the low awareness of the car, adding to the past history of the brand, perhaps - there are a lot of factors which could have made contributions, it's hard to pinpoint to one particular.	1
	on the flip side, you can ask the question why does santa fe sells so well...                                it's one thing to analyze the reasons, whatever they might be, but saying hyundai hasn't tried (i.e.	1
	no marketing, no training, dealer professionalism) and implying as if they have no idea what they are doing for the                 entire                us operation is absurd.	1
	you'd have to remember, this is a two-way street.	1
	if consumers don't respond, no matter how great the car is, or how much $$$ the automaker allocate marketing the car, it doesn't mean a thing until delivery takes place.	1
	we might be seeing a bit of that with the azera.	1

	but i may have no choice.	1
	i pretty much will be in the position of having to get a new car this summer as my current car is being given over to my youngest daughter.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1148#msg1148re: plain grille [cdmuile]        re: 1147                the grille on the genesis shown in the super bowl ad was not like either of these shown.	1
	one would assume that if hyundai spent the big bucks for a super bowl ad, they would depict the car that they would be selling in the us market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1149#msg1149re: plain grille [floridabob1]        fwiw, both ads had the disclaimer, 'korean model shown'.	1
	manufacturers do this all the time.	1
	for example, i have a brochure next to me right now, and the car featured in the print looks different than the model in the nearest showroom, disclaimer, 'european model shown'.	1
	the super bowl ads serve a couple of purposes - one of which is a sneak preview/teaser about a new model; more importantly, it sets a continued premise in the elevation of the brand image.	1
	of course, i would think hyundai wants and expects to make inroads and tap into the luxury segment, but the indirect impact/effect the genesis will have on the rest of the line and the brand overall is much more valuable and important, hard to quantify on a scale really.	1
	on another note, in addition to the super bowl ads and internet marketing currently running on various websites such as edmunds (since the us debut last month), there are a lot more marketing campaign to appear in the next few months as the car draws near its availability in showroom.	1
	hyundai says the marketing will be the largest campaign in the us to date, obviously through various media outlets, but also tie-in with premium establishments and long pre-sell period, with events such as invitation-only and ride-and-drive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1150#msg1150look ma, no emblem         mostly luxury cars are adorned proudly with the maker's logo on the grille or hood.	1
	not the hyundai genesis.	1
	hyundai has decided to omit its logo from the grille of the new genesis luxury sedan, the company announced this week.	1
	at the detroit auto show, the automaker showed one version of the genesis with the hyundai logo and one without.	1
	apparently, reaction to the version without the logo was more positive, so that one will see production.	1
	hyundai's vice president of product development disclosed the decision at the chicago auto show this week, according to trade publication automotive news.	1
	many consumers associate the hyundai nameplate with economy cars, so it's likely hyundai feels the need to shun the image as much as possible.	1
	there were rumors about a new hyundai luxury brand, but so far that idea has not materialized.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1151#msg1151grill is not right        nice looking car inside and out.	1
	i'm really getting used to the interior with the friendly ergonomic buttons yet classy in overall appearence.	1
	but the one part of the design that can really hurt this car is that crazy waterfall grill.	1
	i honestly like the black sticker korean version grill better than the grill one.	1
	hyundai imo really should have tried to have the concept grill as close to the production one because that was amazing and it embodied the word 'genesis'.	1
	well but then again if hyundai could have even came 75 percent of the production version design they would have been a viable threat to bmw and mercedez imo because that concept was a beauty       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1155#msg1155re: plain grille [microrepair]        without really looking into it, i recall hyundai spokespeople, at the unveiling, mentioning that some design features had yet to be decided upon.	1
	one of these features being the grill.	1
	therefore, two designs were on the display vehicles.	1
	one grill having the droopy h and the other without it.	1
	some automobile journalists dubbed the latter the 'waterfall' grill and others called it the 'plain' grill meaning without the big h. yes, i meant the one with the three or four horizontal bars depending on how you count them.	1
	viewer reaction favored the h-less grill.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1156#msg1156re: plain grille [cdmuile]        and, i'm so glad that they chose to listen to the customer base and go with the 'h' less grill.	1
	to me, the car looks beautiful without the hyundai h, so much so that it is probably at the top of my list when i am planning on buying a new car this summer.	1
	this is despite my reservations about my local dealer's service department, the hesitation to buy a new model car, the fact that it could be dropped by hyundai in rapid order should it not meet sale's expectations, etc.	1
	now, i'm hoping that things like price, initial industry reports, and a thorough test drive bear out the expectations many are building around the newest to the hyundai stable.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1157#msg1157re: plain grille [keitha3]        reservations about local dealer service, fear of a new model and fear of the vehicle being discontinued:  sounds like you have too many negatives to seriously consider this car.	1
	if you do buy it, you'll be continuously second guessing yourself whenever something is not perfect.	1
	perhaps you should buy something else.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1158#msg1158re: plain grille [bhmr59]        no, i won't.	1
	i always have some reservations before purchasing a car, not afterwards.	1
	did you ever think that i might second guess myself later on if i were to buy something more tried and true and ended up wishing i'd gone with my gut and bought the hyundai?	1
	it's called due diligence.	1
	there is no car that exists where i wouldn't try to carefully consider potential downsides prior to purchase.	1
	even on a great car like a 911, i'd question whether i was using my money wisely, potential repair and maintenance costs down the line, practicality, and on and on.	1
	i just do as much as i can before the fact to best insure my eventual satisfaction.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1159#msg1159re: plain grille [keitha3]        that's a good mantra to shop out any vehicle.	1
	you need to consider all of the pros/cons from a personal framework.	1
	here's my initial take:  the genesis is a great concept that hyundai is investing in because they are using the value button.	1
	the first year is tricky because too many things need to go right with the initial launch (read nit problems).	1
	because of the value, the buy decision is enticing if the drive experience is very close to the big guns in this category.	1
	even if out the door the genesis is $40k, this car will no doubt carve out a decent following.	1
	just do not expect top quality and it will be a go.	1

	lexicon is the high end of harman-kardon, who also makes infinity.	1
	the infinity sound system in the azera is a pretty good sounding system.	1
	it's not audiophile quality, but...it's head and shoulders better than most i've heard in other cars.	1
	bose used to be the standard for top notch car audio, but i've found that not all bose systems in all cars really sound that great!	1
	i was reading an article where they asked super-producer swizz beatz for his opinion on the best sounding stereo sytem in a vehicle.	1
	his ultimate fave was the lexicon system in the rolls.	1
	i'm pretty sure that if the lexicon in the genesis sounds just half as good as the one in the rolls...it'll still be better than anything else.	1
	maybe, just maybe...this would be the first sound system i won't touch in a car that i've owned...naaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!	1
	lol  i'll still find something wrong with it.	1
	we'll see.        	1

	huh?	1
	didn't recall saying that.	1
	maybe you can show me where.	1
	in any regard, it        does make an important aesthetic difference to me...and others i assume.	1
	much like color of paint or interior styling, something can be important to a consumer and not impact performance whatsoever.	1
	as for the lexicon, i really am hoping that i like it as much as swizz beatz did in the rolls (thanks for pointing that out).	1
	i've only read one other comment about the car system and it was similar in tone.	1
	by the way, i've never been a fan of bose in home theater systems, but thought they did an 'acceptable' job in an infiniti (the car) system i heard.	1
	if you end up with a genesis, i'd be interested to hear how you modified the sound system.	1
	i used to be a moderator on a home theater forum and know that pretty well, but am kind of...well more than kind of...clueless as far as automobiles.	1
	only on a test drive, granted, but the azera opened my eyes as to how good a hyundai could be and, if the genesis improves on this significantly, i'll be mightily impressed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1173#msg1173more info on lexicon         featuring a wide array of audio innovations, the lexicon discrete surround audio system contains 7.1 channels of sound with a total output of 528 watts through 17 transducers (speakers).	1
	two 3-way transducer systems provide the best-possible timbre balance, while also improving the clarity of audio playback.	1
	five 2-way transducer systems yield the same sonic signature across all channels for optimum consistency in tone.	1
	in addition to handling multiple media sources, lexicon's digital signal processing (dsp) provides unique system equalization giving both driver and passengers the best possible acoustic performance of any vehicle available today.	1
	hyundai genesis joins the rolls royce phantom as the only automobile to offer a lexicon-branded audio system featuring logic 7(r) technology, which creates a wide and extremely satisfying sound stage for the system.	1
	lexicon digital sound processing technologies are used on more than 80 percent of all professional recordings, tv broadcasts, film soundtracks and music.	1
	founded in 1971, lexicon's involvement in both audio production and playback is unique in the industry.	1
	in 1978, the company introduced the first commercially-viable reverb line.	1
	because dsp is used when the audio is created, playback on a lexicon system is more true-to-life than on any other system.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1174#msg1174re: look ma, no emblem [keitha3]        from post #1171 -                 while the emblem is a huge factor to me and my wife, a bigger factor will be the sound system.	1
	well...i hope they do it a little different than they did with the azera.	1
	i really like the korean version with the clean grille and then have the 'h' on the trunk lid.	1
	bose home theaters can sound good, but in my opinion...they are not the best.	1
	don't get me wrong, they offer great sound from the package they are in.	1
	as far as the infinity system in the azera...i've heard infinity in other cars, i've heard jbl, bose, boston acoustics and the one in the azera has sounded better than almost all of them.	1
	well...i modded the system in my azera.	1
	i changed the head unit, replaced the door speakers and added a sub in the trunk.	1
	as good as the factory set up was, it didn't offer the sound control i needed for my tastes.	1
	the bottom end was really the one thing that truly lacked in the set up and that's why i added the aftermarket sub.	1
	to be honest...working with car audio is a lot like home audio.	1
	you find speakers that give you sound the way you like it and go with it.	1
	as far as the genesis, i would see only changing the door speakers (maybe) and possibly adding a sub in the trunk.	1
	i wouldn't mess with the head unit as it offers so much as is.	1
	the only tricky part would be adding the aftermarket sub, but if i tap in to the rear speaker outputs behind the head unit, run it to a line level converter so i can use rca cables and then run rca cables to the amp for the signal to the sub...done deal.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1175#msg1175re: look ma, no emblem [allmet33]        well, i will never be a fan of bose home systems, but i won't go into all the reasons here, but i agree so much on the value of a good, tight sub.	1
	really, it just doubles my listening enjoyment.	1
	i really, really hope that the genesis is solid in this regard.	1
	i am envious of your knowledge in that i have little clue as to how i'd install one.	1
	there is a pretty good shop, from what i hear, near me, but i'd have to see how much they'd have to modify the car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1176#msg1176re: look ma, no emblem [keitha3]        bose home systems are great for music, don't care for them as home theater.	1
	the factory sub in the azera does a decent job, but...it struggles with the real low lows.	1
	so...with the head unit i have in now...the whole back end of the car (door speakers and factory sub) is cut off at 100 hz high pass and the sub in the trunk is cut off at 100 hz low pass.	1
	the front sound stage is cut off at 80 hz high pass and if you close your eyes, you can almost see the performer standing on the dash singing to you.	1
	actually...it's not has hard as you think.	1
	be careful with those shops, they can rip you off big time.	1
	a guy in the saturn forum i frequent got a pioneer avic-d2 installed in the dash and paid $1700 for everything!!!	1
	i found the unit for $650, the gm harness to keep on-star and door chimes working was $130, dash kits and wire harnesses would be another $40...installing would take maybe an hour from start to finish.	1
	they really took him for a ride.	1
	if you ever want to give it a try, just let me know...you'll be surprised at how easy it really is.	1
	the car itself wouldn't have to modified, just tap into a few wires here and there and, viola!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1177#msg1177re: look ma, no emblem [allmet33]        hey thanks, allmet.	1
	i have two young daughters and know the local high school's autoshop teacher pretty well.	1
	between all the boys hanging around my house and all the kids he has in his classes, i'll probably get all the installation help i need.	1
	where i might hit you up is on at that point is your recommendations for possible subs.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1178#msg1178re: look ma, no emblem [keitha3]        cool, cool!!!	1
	well, i certainly can point you in the right direction and i can work with any budget you set.	1
	the only thing i would need to know is what type of sound you're looking for, what type of music you listen to and how do you listen to your music.	1
	like you, i've got a family (3 kids ranging from 6 mos - 13 yrs).	1
	i can play my music low and still enjoy full sound without blowing out my kids' ears.	1
	however, when i'm rolling solo with the windows down, i can crank up the tunes and hear everything over the wind, road noise and other cars around me.	1
	the infinity kappa series speakers in the doors are much more effecient than the factory ones were so it utilizes the power from the factory amp and plays louder and cleaner.	1
	since i listen to a variety of music, my sub is in a sealed box and it's pushing about 450 watts.	1
	for some, that would be overkill, for some...a subtle upgrade.	1
	in my opinion...it's just right.	1
	here's the kicker...i'm actually going to be upgrading my sub set up so i can utilize my 600 watt phoenix gold xenon amp.	1
	in order to do so, i have to use 2 subs to split the power up, instead of feeding it all to one sub.	1
	soooooooooooo...hopefully when spring hits, i'll be able to work on it.	1
	the idea is an enclosure of concave design, painted glossy black to match the car and the amp will be mounted in such a way that it looks like it's floating in front of the subs.	1
	you can visit my carspace page to see the current set up.	1
	whatever assistance you need, just let me know.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1179#msg1179re: look ma, no emblem [allmet33]        went and viewed both the interior and exterior mods.	1
	super cool.	1
	my favorites were that phoenix amp (that's a beautiful looking amp) and the head unit at night.	1
	you are talented!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1180#msg1180re: look ma, no emblem [keitha3]        thank you very much.	1
	i love that phoenix amp as well...that's why i gotta get it back in the car.	1
	right now...my sub is being powered by a kenwood amp.	1
	the thing i was able to do was go with matching subs...the phoenix gold xenon subs have a dust cap that looks like the amp.	1
	it took me a while to pick the head unit, and i wanted something that flowed with the interior and gave me what i wanted feature-wise.	1
	the enclosure i built the way i did so that i could still utilized the folding rear seats and not have to take the sub out.	1
	well, now that we have a truck in the family...it's not so important an issue any more, so now i can go crazy with my set up.	1
	at some point...i plan on putting my car in shows, so i've gotta plan for it.	1
	the biggest interior change will be getting suede inserts in the seats that match the darker color on the top portion of the dash.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1181#msg1181genesis stereo        the genesis uses the fiber optic most interface.	1
	so putting in aftermarket equipment is going to be a nightmare.	1
	i don't think the dash is designed to put in aftermarket stereo equipment.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1182#msg1182re: genesis stereo [rv65]        the only way it would be a problem is if the fiber optics run from the head unit to the amp.	1
	if it does, then it would be a matter of time before scosche or metra comes up with an adapter that will allow you to tap into the fiber optics.	1
	the other option would be to tap into the signal from the sub (after the amp) as this would less likely be a fiber optic cable as a long run in an automobile would not be conducive to running fiber optics.	1
	at any rate, i'll just have to sit back, wait and see.	1
	initially, the azera didn't seem to have a dash that would be accepting of aftermarket equipment.	1
	where there's a will...there will always be a way!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1183#msg1183leasing the genesis        do you all think leasing a genesis will be an option when it first comes out?	1
	(this may be a dumb question, but i'm just not familiar with how car companies deal with the release of a new car with regards to leasing.)	1
	thanks!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1184#msg1184re: leasing the genesis [tank13]        i see it as a real possibility.	1
	it may not be available for lease right out the door because the dealership makes more money by selling the car with in house financing to make interest on the deal.	1
	however, give it 3 to 6 months (i'd venture to say by late fall of this year) you should be able to get one fairly easily.	1
	the best part of a car company leasing is it allows more people to get a try at the car and voice their opinion.	1
	the quickest way to get excitement about a vehicle and, subsequently, more business is to get the car out in the public faster and in more numbers.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1187#msg1187on sale date, leasing        have there been any updates on when the genesis will actually be at the dealerships?	1
	as for leasing, why lease?	1
	why lease or finance a rapidly depreciating item such as a car if you can't afford to pay cash?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1188#msg1188re: on sale date, leasing [fsmmcsi]        some people like to drive more car than they can afford.	1
	seriously, sometimes the manufacturer will subsidize the lease, and the payments can be very attractive.	1
	for example, hyundai has in the past subsidized the lease payments on the sonata, and maybe on other hyundais also.	1
	i can recall lease payments on the 2006+ sonata gls as low as $169/mo.	1
	with nothing down, in my area.	1
	that can be a good option for someone who intends to keep the car for only 2-3 years.	1
	the payments might not be much more than the depreciation on the car, so there's little risk.	1
	but no word yet if any such lease will be available on the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1189#msg1189re: on sale date, leasing [fsmmcsi]        rapidly depreciating is a relative term when you talk about cars.	1
	most people cannot afford to pay cash for a new car, that's just the way it has been for decades.	1
	according to edmunds, my almost 35 month old, low milage '05 sonata is worth about 57% of what i paid for it on a private party resale.	1
	that's pretty rapid depreciation but in the ball park of other mid-size cars.	1
	at my present rate of payment, the car will be paid off in 15 months and i will own it, only having to pay for regular maintenance--average a couple hundred bucks a year(?).	1
	the car has been trouble free and a pleasure to own and drive.	1
	yeah, i could have paid cash for a $6000 used car rather than financing this car but i am sure that there would have been other expenses since that time and the car would have been 'how many years' older leading to more maintenance expense.	1
	nobody has an idea what the depreciation on the genesis will be.	1
	in fact, as hyundai's reputation has been gradually growing in the last few years, nobody knows what the depreciation of any hyundai will be in a couple of years.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1190#msg1190release date        expect it to hit dealers in may/june.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1191#msg1191re: on sale date, leasing [fsmmcsi]        it's a way to spread out the cash outflow, instead of 100% upfront.	1
	the trade off is you are paying the interest.	1

	it was on a turntable so i couldn't sit in it, but the doors were open.	1
	they were doing a sales pitch from the turntable every so often.	1

	there was a good-sized crowd listening to the pitch.	1
	in fact, there was a big crowd throughout the hyundai exhibit.	1
	that is noteworthy because in past years, i could have done some bowling there without any risk of hitting anyone.	1
	there were lots of people pouring over the cars, especially the veracruzes, santa fes, and 2009 sonatas.	1
	there were also several large backlit hyundai posters showing off the genesis, santa fe, and sonata all along the main skyway (2nd-story enclosed walkways between buildings) leading to the convention center.	1
	the exhibit itself was well-done, i thought--showcasing the genesis and elantra touring, with at least two of each other model (except the tibby, just one) to check out on the floor.	1
	and a cut-away sonata showing off its safety features.	1

	it's a different car compared to the genesis.	1
	the azera was the flagship sedan and now the genesis will be, basically pushing the azera to the #2 spot held by the sonata previously.	1
	i mean...genesis being rwd and azera being fwd...you'll have some that will choose based on that alone.	1

	the genesis stands out   'potentially' as a home run for value relative to the european, domestic and japanese alternatives.	1
	will the resale be spotty?	1
	could be.	1
	will the car's driving dynamics be up to par?	1
	looking forward to the test drive to evaluate that.	1
	for me, a robust v8, rwd sedan option under $40k is worth a very close look.	1
	nothing in the marketplace today offers comparable value if the genesis actually shows up in dealers at this price point with a 360+ hp v8, rwd and composed driving dynamics.	1
	if it does, i will own one and care less what the neighbors think about the nameplate.	1

	the market will not pay the same price for a sonata as they will for an accord or camry until hyundai's resale value equals those two proven sedans.	1
	imo hyundai is getting ahead of itself with its '09 sonata pricing.	1
	the genesis is priced $15-20k below what it is supposedly worth for that very reason.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1211#msg1211re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [lookylou1]        actually...don't take exception to the genesis being up on the hands-off display.	1
	most companies have done that with their vehicles that aren't actually ready to drop until later on.	1
	buick did the same with the enclave, lincoln did it with the upcoming mkz and pontiac followed suit with the g8 here at the dc auto show last year.	1
	this year...the enclave was down on the floor where folks could get in it, but since the g8, mkz and genesis aren't exactly going into show rooms until sometime around summer or shortly after...they were all on the hands-off display.	1
	i don't think the idea is to hide anything from the public...look at the enclave for instance.	1
	one year it's up on the hands-off display, then it's in show rooms and it gets rave reviews.	1
	i think it's more about keeping the mystique going...show a little, but not everything.	1
	make potential buyers go to the show rooms and check it out fully...then there will be a greater chance of one buying.	1
	as far as the sonata goes...don't know what hyundai is thinking.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1212#msg1212re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [lookylou1]        the 2009 sonata is still priced about $1500-2000 +- less than comparably-equipped camcords.	1
	plus you can bet that once the 2008s are gone, some form of incentives will reappear on the sonatas, putting the price effectively $3000+ less than camcords.	1
	plus there's the long warranty, which you don't get for free with camcords.	1
	given the competitive performance and quality of the 2009 sonata, i think that kind of pricing is plenty competitive.	1
	i find it interesting when people complain (sometimes in the same post) about prices going up on hyundais and their historically lower resale value compared to honda and toyota.	1
	you won't see jumps in resale value without corresponding increases in up-front price.	1
	money still doesn't magically appear out of thin air, no matter how much we wish it would.	1
	we don't know the actual pricing of the genesis yet, so to say it's priced $15-20k below what it's worth is premature.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1213#msg1213re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [allmet33]        some of the luxury cars that are available for sale now were locked up at the twin cities auto show this weekend.	1
	i noticed also, for example, chevy wasn't letting anyone sit in the camaro that was on display, and dodge wasn't letting anyone sit in the challenger.	1
	both were on pedestals.	1
	shoot, honda had a 2008 accord lx-p locked up, on a pedestal (i noticed that only leather-trimmed accords were open for sitting in--no lesser trims were open, on the floor.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1214#msg1214re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [backy]        what some fail to realize too...the prices on the competition go up too.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1215#msg1215re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [backy]        well...here at the dc auto show...benz had plenty of cars open for folks to climb in, however...there were quite a few that weren't.	1
	porsche...same thing and same can be said of audi, volvo and cadillac.	1
	the point is...they never make every car available for folks to climb into.	1
	the camaro hasn't hit the streets yet, neither has the challenger.	1
	as far as honda goes...would you want a lesser trimmed cloth interior vehicle open to thousands of folks climbing in and out of it???	1
	i think not.	1
	there is plenty that goes on at the shows, but again...it's nothing to take exception to.	1
	it's just a case of not wanting to tip their hand and make potential buyers want to go take a look at it as well as maybe even a test drive.       	1

	i think not.	1
	didn't seem to be a problem for toyota (base camry on the floor), hyundai (base sonata), mercury (base milan), chevy (base malibu), saturn (base aura) etc.	1
	what i suspect is that honda realizes that its ex-l cars look much nicer inside than the lx and lx-p, so they decided to put their best foot foward.	1
	i appreciated being able to check out the base models of the competition, however.	1
	and although the genesis was on a rotating pedestal, all of its doors were open so we could at least get a good look inside.       	1

	if the fit and finish is there and the car drives well, i will spring for a v8 version.	1
	at $38-40k the car will be a bargain very similar in value to the original lexus ls400 back in 1989. now then will the resale values continue to improve as the product has?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1218#msg1218re: genesis a disappointment at kc auto show [backy]        well...i'm sure honda had their reasons.	1
	i wanted, so badly, to jump on that pedestal and jump inside the genesis that was on display.	1
	the one they had here was the red with brown leather interior, it really looked nice.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1219#msg1219re: some info leaked... [leovincecarguy]        well...from everything i've heard...fully loaded, the genesis shouldn't be over $3k.	1
	before the azera dropped, i was being told that it would top out at $31k...maybe that was msrp, but the price i paid for my '06 azera w/premium package was just over $26k (out the door)...the sticker price was $29,385.	1
	the ultimate package was only $1500k more.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1221#msg1221re: some info leaked... [joe97]        well, i'm hoping so too as i remember hyundai saying that fully loaded the genesis would be ~$40k.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1223#msg1223re: some info leaked... [allmet33]        this was a couple of months ago, when it became 'official' that the genesis was us bound.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1224#msg1224re: some info leaked... [bigelm]        couple months ago???	1
	it's been official for longer than a couple of months that the genesis was u.s. bound.	1
	at any rate...i do truly believe that a fully loaded genesis in v-8 form will be sub-$40k.	1
	how close to $40k will probably depend on what your location is.	1
	however, like the azera...what you actually pay for it will be different.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised (if my info holds true) that you would be paying (out the door) around $36k for a fully loaded v-8.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1229#msg1229a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	i spoke to the manager of a large hyundai dealership in the kc area two weeks ago and he was somewhat upset that i phoned to ask about the genesis.	1
	'i have 300 vehicles on my lot and not one of them is a genesis,' he lamented.	1
	hyundais marketing strategy for the genesis is very odd.	1
	they advertise it on the super bowl months before it will be released.	1
	there are only going to be 1,000 genesis cars available to 700 dealers in the us.	1
	what does that tell you about your chances of buying one or me selling you one?	1
	this makes zero sense to me (that hyundai would roll out a flagship model so sparingly) but i have no reason to not believe this dealer.	1
	he was definitely not excited about the genesis.	1
	the azera is a helluva car, he added.	1
	but no one will even look at them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1230#msg1230re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[lookylou1]        so here's a thought maybe... use the genesis to entice buyers to at least come into a hyundai dealership (still a problem for hyundai--get butts in seats), and they can see the azera and veracruz and all the rest.	1
	maybe they'll still want to buy a genesis.	1
	or maybe they'll wind up buying an azera or...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1231#msg1231sleezy        sounds like the ol' bait and switch to me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1232#msg1232re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[lookylou1]        come on now...do you really believe that a company like hyundai is trying to create a level of exclusivity by only shipping 1000 genesis vehicles to the u.s.  if you break that number up amongst the 3 trim levels they are going to have for it...that's not many of each.	1
	i think the dealer you spoke to is blowing smoke up your wazoo.	1
	it may be his way to make someone feel that the must pre-order when the chance comes to get one.	1
	1000 says he, that means each dealership (major dealership at that) would get 1 genesis to sell.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1233#msg1233re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[lookylou1]        i have to throw in with allmet33, that there is no chance hyundai is 'only' bringing 1,000 genesis models to the u.s. market.	1
	the rd investment in a new power plant, the tau v8 and a rear drive chassis is major $.	1
	the u.s. is....the market for that car especially the v8 version when you roll global gas prices into the mix and the relative market acceptance of the brand versus european and japanese competitors in their home markets.	1
	your dealer is a......dealer.	1
	translation..the retailer is always most interested in selling what he/she is currently paying a inventory interest payment on, not some hot future model not yet on the lot.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1234#msg1234re: genesis pricing leaked!	1

	[lookylou1]        tell the manager to stop drinking whatever he's drinking                                of course there is no genesis on his lot right now.	1
	no dealerships across the north america continent has one for sale currently.	1
	don't believe the 1,000 units of genesis, it's probably a way for                 that                dealership to entice you to get one - 'we have so few of these, if you don't get one, there wouldn't be any left...', or something to that effect                                the genesis will be arriving in a few months, and there will be a long pre-sell period, with events such as invitation drives (which i'd assume for a few days) and various marketing tie-in with premium establishments.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1236#msg1236re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[allmet33]        do i think they would only make 1000 genesis?	1
	probably not, but i do think the genesis will be in very short supply.	1
	when i bought my azera in march of 2006, i talked to or visited seven hyundai dealership.	1
	two didn't have any azeras (and, remember, this was four months after they were released).	1
	three only had the floor model, and the other two had less than six total.	1
	the azera was is very short supply and i had to drive to a different city to find one in black.	1
	i think the genesis will be in shorter supply than the azera.	1
	and i think the v8 genesis will be a very rare find.	1
	good luck on that one.	1
	based on my experience with the azera, i also think the dealerships will be very unprepared for the genesis and have totally inaccurate information about it.	1
	and since they will be in short supply, i can easily see them steering customers to the huge volume of cars sitting on their lots collecting dust.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1237#msg1237re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[ricwhite]        yeah...i don't know the hyundai logic when they brought the azera out.	1
	i bought mine at one dealership, but they had to go get it from another dealer because they didn't have the one i wanted.	1
	i bought mine feb./mar.	1
	of '06 as well and encountered the same thing you did...very, very few to see, much less choose from.	1
	i hope it's not an indication of how things will go with the genesis.	1
	it is my thinking that the genesis will help the sales of the other cars though.	1
	it is one car generating buzz and interest amongst anyone that knows about cars.	1
	even if it's just to go check it out, it'll bring folks in the door and when they see the azera, veracruz  updated sonata...they're gonna be like, 'whoa...i didn't know they had all these nice cars!'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1238#msg1238re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[joe97]        the 1000 number could be legit.	1
	consider:                                * maybe not every hyundai dealer will get them.	1
	wasn't there talk that dealers would need to demonstrate that they                 deserve                to sell the genesis?	1
	* maybe there will be 1000 in the                 first                (partial) year.	1
	that makes sense, to ramp up production gradually for an all-new design that is different than anything hyundai has attempted before.	1
	also it allows dealers to make sure they are providing the best possible service to genesis customers.	1
	keep in mind the service techs will need to be trained on these cars.	1
	they ain't no accent.	1
	once everything is ship-shape and assuming demand is there, hyundai can take a page from doritos and 'just make more.'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1239#msg1239re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[backy]        okay...with that logic, i can see 1000 as an intial shipment, but to say 1000 will be shipped period is crazy!	1
	i can see a dealer saying that to create a panic amongst buyers and make them think they have to hurry and get one or they won't have a chance at getting one.	1
	there have been postings that some dealerships already have stripped down versions of the genesis for the sole purpose of the techs getting aquainted with them (sure wish they had done that with the azera).       	1

	[backy]        could be, although hyundai has given no public figures as to how many units would be shipped from s. korea (unlike the gt-r).	1
	actually, the goal hyundai looks to achieve (for a full year) is a lot higher, and even if you pro-rate, the 1,000 (let's for first partial year) just doesn't make much sense.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1245#msg1245re: a total of only 1,000 genesis for us market?	1
	[goldsuv]        the associated press                published: january 8, 2008                                seoul, south korea: hyundai motor co. launched its new rear-wheel drive genesis luxury sedan tuesday in a splashy official debut for a car the south korean company sees as its ticket into the ranks of the world's top-end automakers.	1
	hyundai preceded the introduction by showing a promotion film featuring a decidedly james bond-like actor driving the sleek, road-hugging vehicle.	1
	the screen then receded to reveal an orchestra and three south korean tenors who gave a live performance of the aria 'nessun dorma' from puccini's opera 'turandot.'	1
	hyundai motor said it invested 500 billion won (us$533 million; 362 million) to develop the genesis over the past four years, and sees it as a competitor to luxury models such as daimler ag's mercedes-benz e-class, bmw ag's 5-series and toyota motor corp.'s lexus gs.	1
	the car 'symbolizes our determination to enter the highly competitive arena of luxury cars now dominated by the europeans,' hyundai chairman and ceo chung mong-koo said in a statement earlier.	1
	'genesis will consolidate our position as the leader of the korean auto industry and will pave the way forward for our leap into the global market.'	1
	hyundai said it aims to sell 55,000 of the vehicles this year, 35,000 at home and 20,000 overseas in north america, china and the middle east.	1
	it is targeting genesis sales of 80,000 in 2009, with 45,000 of that total in foreign markets.	1
	hyundai plans to begin u.s. sales in june and in china in august, said company spokesman jake jang, who added it would begin running ads for the car in the u.s. around may.	1
	stephen ahn, an auto industry analyst at woori investment  securities co., said hyundai is treading the path of japanese automakers such as toyota, nissan motor co. and honda motor co. that launched luxury cars to transcend earlier reputations as solid makers of quality vehicles.	1
	'i think genesis could be the next catalyst for brand-value growth' for hyundai, said ahn, who predicted the company will sell about 50,000 of the vehicles this year, slightly short of the hyundai's stated goal.       	1

	maybe if you actually read what i write, instead of concentrate on bean counting without getting the facts, you would have noticed i was talking about the product mix between the trims.	1
	if i didn't know better, hyundai should just pack up their bags and leave the us market, based on your assessments.	1
	anyway, in case you haven't noticed, hyundai has enjoyed higher than predicted sales of limited trims on the veracruz and azera, as initially the base and mid-range trims was predicted to make up the bulk of the sales.       	1

	the current tib w/the 2.7 v-6 tips the scales at 3010.  the                genesis coupe will be about 10' longer, the wheelbase will be about 12' more, it'll also have the 3.3 v-6...i think it's possible for the genesis coupe in v-6 form to weigh in around 3300...which really isn't all that bad to be honest.	1

	i think it's a pointlessly busy chris bangle pukefest.	1
	in fact, i'd say the same thing about the new accord, the new acura rl, and several other misguided imitations of something not worth making, let alone imitating.	1
	every time an asian maker knocks off that abominable 'flame surfacing,' it lends new fuel to the criticism that they can't create, only imitate.	1
	as i've written before, the shame of this is that honda in particular has shown the ability to design a clean car (s2000, last-gen accord) when it wasn't obsessed with the 'safety' of being derivative.	1
	rest assured this isn't the fault of the designers, but the gutless executives who rule them.       	1

	i also do not like the gauge cluster layout.	1
	the driver's-side cockpit doesn't flow with the car.	1
	they have copied the instrumentation that everyone is using but with the gauge pods sticking out and at angles it doesn't make for a nice dash layout.	1
	this is really apparent in a side view.	1
	it's really busy and there aren't enough gauges for my taste.	1
	the pods should not jut out at the driver, they should flow into the rest of the dash and the 'hood'; these look like after thoughts at best.	1
	on the head-on shot the busy-ness almost makes the entire dash look one-sided.	1
	maybe it's the angle of the shot, as with the front-end shots, but the items i've mentioned look awkward and out of place.	1
	just my opinion.	1
	i will reserve final judgment when more pics arrive and this coupe hits our land so i can get some seat time in one.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1300#msg1300re: air scoop asks a question [air_scoops]        doubt it...probably hit some time next year.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1302#msg1302re: air scoops [air_scoops]        air scoops you say???	1
	well...clearly, lookin at the pics of the concept version and the production version....the only differences are:                                removal of the vents in the hood (looks cool, but more of an aftermarket addition)                the upper, center grille...is pretty much still the same size.	1
	if you look closely, the lower grilles aer pretty much the same size with the exception of the fog lights on the production model, but if you look at the concept version...there is trim that almost equals the amount of space taken up by the fog lights.	1
	lastly...the rear brake vents located at the rear qtr panel.	1
	extremely cool...yes, necessary...no.	1
	again...a nice aftermarket addition since you would only need to worry about additional brake cooling if you're gonna make this a track car and actually race it.	1
	as far as the back goes...it pretty much looks the same except for the lacking spoiler, which i'm sure one would be offered when production actually takes place.	1
	one nice thing would if hyundai offered a gt version where one could order the genesis coupe decked out with the carbon fiber pieces as seen on the concept vehicle.	1
	i think that would be a huge hit!!!	1
	the lines of the car still remain the same on the upper portion (the sides), but with the removal of the rear brake vent, the lower lines change slightly.	1
	i also think the color difference makes a huge difference.	1
	not to mention how it was photographed.	1
	the orange concept version capitalizes on shadows to accentuate the creases and lines on the car in an indoor setting.	1
	the silver production version...well, the creases and lines are lost in the lighter color and also being photographed outside.	1
	also, the two tone of the black carbon fiber against the orange lends itself to a more aggressive look as well.	1
	in short, the concept almost always looks better than the actual production model.                                                                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1303#msg1303re: air scoops [allmet33]        thanks for the repost.	1
	much better!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1304#msg1304re: air scoops [pat]        my bad on the initial posting.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1307#msg1307genesis delays        i found the following post elsewhere on the internet.	1
	the poster is korean/american and found the article on yahoo korea.	1
	the poster is highlighting in english from the article published in korean.	1
	according to the article, hyundai already got advance contracts for 15,000 + unit pre-orders for genesis in korea, and so far hyundai delivered only 434 units to buyers in january and 2,809 units in february.	1
	(march sales figure not yet announced)                  hyundai says still 9,000 + customers are on the waiting list who have been waiting more than 3 months and hyundai just mailed 'apology letter' to the frustrated customers by promising prompt delivery.	1
	the causes of delay of the production are , according to hyundai motor president , there was shortage of lexicon audios that goes into dis(driver information system).	1
	hyundai anticipated that about 30~40 % of the potential customers would choose the premium option, and they initially had ordered far less audio system from german supplier.	1
	however, it turned out more than 80% of genesis buyers all wanted this audios and this unexpected demand has caused production delay from factory.	1
	another cause of delay was frequent 'learn by mistake' problems surrounding assembly workers in the factory at early stage.	1
	the article says besides new measures for strict quality control process enforced for genesis, assembly workers had trouble learning new technique and skills to adjust to the introduction of new 'state of the art' genesis assembly line.	1
	but most of the material supply and technology issue gone away, hyundai plans to produce 3,000 units per month in april and 5,000 units per month from may to the rest of the year.	1
	hope this article serves well for those who are waiting to buy genesis in states.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1308#msg1308re: genesis delays [dborth]        and what is the credibility of this article the poster kept mentioning?	1
	also, a lot of things in the translation don't make sense - for one, it's no longer called pre-order after the product becomes available.	1
	this is what i know and comes from hyundai - thru.	1
	february, the company has sold just under 13k units of the genesis in the first 7 weeks of availablilty (s. korean market).	1
	i am not saying the source is incorrect, but i will wait for published reports to confirm if this was/is the case.	1
	as they say, don't believe everything you read (on the internet)        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1309#msg1309re: tutor [air_scoops]        i wasn't going for quality of pics, i was posting to point out the similarities/differences between the concept and production version of the genesis coupe.	1
	jagginess???	1
	maybe                 jaggedness                                at any rate, my point was obviously made if all you can talk about is the 'quality' of the pics that were posted.	1
	also...when you use an emotorcon such as                there's no need to explain what it is...obviously, it's winking.	1
	who said anything about this beign my thread?	1
	i'm merely a contributor here.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1310#msg1310re: genesis delays [joe97]        not knowing when it was available over there in korea and not knowing the date of that article that was posted...it's possible at the time it was written, the genesis wasn't yet available.	1
	from the sounds of it, hyundai is having the same problem saturn had with the sky.	1
	i really hope the same problem doesn't happen over on this side of the pond.	1
	then again, maybe that's why the genesis didn't roll out as early as initially anticipated.	1
	the push back could be due to the obvious lag in production.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1311#msg1311re: genesis delays [joe97]        re 1309:  i don't read or speak korean, 'joe97'.	1
	maybe you do                and can enlighten us all.	1
	here is the link to the yahoo korean article.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1312#msg1312re: genesis delays [dborth]        for giggles, i tried doing a translation using microsoft word.	1
	i'm sure if i sat and really read through it...i could get the gist of what is being said, but whoa!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1313#msg1313re: genesis delays [allmet33]        i think the point is hyundai has screwed up the genesis launch in their own home market.	1
	if they weren't ready for korea, their assembly line now must look like a fire drill trying to get product to the us with the reasonable expectation of initial quality assurance.	1
	now, about those super bowl spots and other recent marketing efforts...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1314#msg1314re: genesis delays [dborth]        concerning the genesis...the super bowl ads were the only ones pertaining to that car.	1
	hyundai has stepped up on the other makes...interestingly enough...still not too much when it comes to the azera though.	1
	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1315#msg1315re: genesis delays [dborth]        imo, a                 real                screw-up would have been to go ahead and ship cars without resolving quality issues.	1
	the fact that hyundai is on top of quality and isn't letting cars go out until the quality is there is a plus i think, not a negative.	1
	better to delay shipments of the early cars then to have quality problems with them that could taint the car for a long time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1316#msg1316re: genesis delays [backy]        who is saying that the cars are having quality issues?	1
	like i said earlier, with this extended delay of the genesis actually showing up...it better be all they say it is or else they will still end up with egg on their face.	1
	please, don't take this as me being against hyundai...i'm pulling for them and hoping that the genesis is all they claim it to be, if not more.	1
	i would love to see a few folks eat a little crow personally.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1317#msg1317re: genesis delays [allmet33]        the earlier post (translation) stated that hyundai was having some trouble implementing its quality controls (probably stricter than any they have used before) on the genesis assembly line.	1
	that was the 'quality issue' i was talking about.	1
	if not fixed, it would most likely lead to quality problems in the cars themselves.	1
	that's why i'm glad hyundai is slowing down shipments to work out their quality controls on the line.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1318#msg1318re: genesis delays [backy]        okay, so it's not necessarily quality issues with the cars themselves, but rather the controls to make sure there are no quality issues with the cars.	1
	slowing down shipments???	1
	more like rescheduling them completely!	1
	a 6-8 month delay can be costly when it comes to their credibility though.	1
	so they have put themselves in a position that this car must be the feather in their cap (so to speak).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1322#msg1322re: genesis delays [air_scoops]        change your name form air_scoops to winkie_boy!	1
	you are late on this one, i already responded to that posting and understood what he said.	1
	thank you very much.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1323#msg1323re: genesis delays [allmet33]         so they have put themselves in a position that this car must be the feather in their cap (so to speak).	1
	they have 2                 sedans                now that are 'feathers', azera and the new sonata.	1
	beyond that, genesis is oversold in korea for a variety of reasons as per the yahoo article link.	1
	maybe hyundai is setting up genesis to sell by allocation in the us.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1325#msg1325time limit        genesis coupe seems okay.	1
	still not liking the front end.	1
	but the rest of the car is quite nice.	1
	too bad it's not coming out this year.	1
	i ain't got time to wait till next year.	1
	genesis sedan is nice, but it's a bit too rich for me.	1
	looks like i'm gonna have to go back to acura tl type-s 6mt........       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1326#msg1326re: genesis delays [dborth]        the sonata...yes.	1
	the azera...only for those that know about them.	1
	the problem with the azera is that folks just don't know about it.	1
	all models that hyundai makes goes through that over in korea...that's homebase.	1
	what i mean by the genesis needing to be the feather in the cap is that by prolonging its u.s. debut...there better be nothing wrong with it that critics can tear it down about.	1
	it needs to be the best car hyundai has ever brought over here in terms of build quality, ride quality and perceived quality...it pretty much needs to be perfect at this point.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1327#msg1327re: time limit [air_scoops]        see...now that's a posting i can respect!	1
	depending on what you want from the genesis sedan...pricing for the 3.8 v-6 version would be highly competitive with the acura tl type-s.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1328#msg1328re: genesis delays [dborth]        you assumed i know korean?	1
	i wouldn't even know where to begin                                i am not korean.	1
	the article doesn't make sense because sales are generally not reported until delivery takes place.	1
	please have whoever posted this validate the source.	1
	hyundai sold just under 13k units from second week of january to end of february - that's a fact.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1329#msg1329re: genesis delays [dborth]        here is direct translation.	1
	by the mid march, hyundai sold 15000 cars but they delivered only 434 in jan. and 2809 in feb.                some customers have to wait for 2~3 months to get theirs.	1
	the ceo of hyundai korea motors, jaekook choi have already sent letters to those customers to apologize the delay and ask patience.	1
	hyundai initially expected that only 30~40% of customers would choose lexicon audio  driver integrate (infomation ??)	1
	system (dis) but it turned out to be that %80+ of customers chose the option.	1
	to ease supply shortage, hyundai quickly made another contract with harmann becker to increase the supply.	1
	hyundai adoped a new advanced painting system for better surface treatment (glossy look), but some workers were not familiar with those new tech, which caused quality control issues, and subsequently the delay of delivery.	1
	the hyundai ceo, mongkoo jung, have already realized the seriousness of the delay problem.	1
	then he visited the 5th ulsan factory (ulsan, south korea) on march 17th and asked help from the staff and line workers to do their best to keep up the demand while maintaining the superb quality.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1330#msg1330re: time limit [allmet33]        very very competitive.	1
	in all likelihood, you'd load a 3.8l v6 genesis and still come                 well                under a acura tl-s, even the v8 genesis you may load up and come under or on par with the base tl-s.                                the acura tl-s starts north of 38k iirc.	1
	nice car (used to own a tl) but given the choice, let me have the rwd, bigger car, with the v8, for about the same (or less) $$$       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1331#msg1331genesis at new york auto show        it was disappointing not to be able to get into the genesis at the ny auto show.	1
	but, it was more disappointing to hear that they would be in dealers as late as august from the hyundai spokesperson.	1
	has anyone received any real clarity about production and delivery dates in the us?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1332#msg1332re: genesis availability        my local dealer said june.	1
	a friend went to the ft. lauderdale auto-show thursday, and sat in a fully loaded genesis before the crowds arrived.	1
	they told him, august.	1
	ny auto show is now saying august.	1
	the local newspapers in asheville, nc did a huge story on the vehcile and ended with 'mid-summer' availability.	1
	this is a problem for me!	1
	my current lease ends may 31st (bmw 750li).	1
	i could rent for a few months or get a vehicle from the dealers used car lot, or, just go ahead and get my second choice vehicle, a fully loaded murano le which is available now.	1
	i only lease for two years, but i am first on the waiting list for the genesis, yet there are no 'real' prices yet upon which to base a decision!	1
	they created the hype a little too far in front of delivery.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1333#msg1333danny        the genesis is featured at the fort lauderdale auto show and they allowed a couple of us at a time to get in it, even though it was on a platform.	1
	it better in person than the photos, comfortable and spaceous.	1
	the front dash is luxurious.	1
	it is what they are claiming that it will compete with luxury cars that is twice the value.	1
	the back seat is awsome and comfortable.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1334#msg1334genesis at some dealers        i saw some ads in my local paper (twin cities) yesterday regarding the genesis sedan being availble for preview and test drives (!)	1
	in the next few days--yesterday at one dealer and early this week at another.	1
	i was pretty busy yesterday and that particular dealer was not close to me, so i couldn't run up and drive it.	1
	don't know if i'll have a chance to do it this week either.	1
	but if this is being done in the twin cities, it's possible it is happening in other cities also.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1336#msg1336re: time limit [air_scoops]        you know...i looked up the acura tl type-s...starting out just north of $38k.	1
	if you get it loaded with various items like the body kit, 18' alloys, side window visors, carbon fiber trim on the interior...msrp jumps to just under $45k.	1
	okay...now let's look at performance...286 hp w/ 256 lbs torque, but...the tl type-s w/manual tranny weighs in just over 3500 lbs.	1
	now...the genesis coupe in v-6 form will be running just over 300 hp, also have over 250 lbs of torque and even if it weighs 3600 lbs, should still out run the tl type-s...for about $10k less.	1
	oh yeah, not to mention...the tl's posted hp numbers are based on using premium fuel, so expect less when you fill it with regular gas.	1
	heck, for that matter, the genesis sedan in 3.8 v-6 form will be better than the tl type-s!!!	1
	well, should i say...be more of a competitor in terms of what you get, however...hands down, the genesis will win out when it comes to bang for buck as the 3.8 v-6 version shouldn't cost any more than about $35k as well.	1
	once again...$10k less than the acura.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1337#msg1337re: genesis at some dealers [backy]        sorry to jump in so late.	1
	the genesis was on a pedestal at the minneapolis auto show.	1
	but a customizer had one in a back room.	1
	denny hecker had one that was lightly customized with some weird big wheels and dark tint, but they let you sit in it.	1
	the interior was not customized at all and was fabulous.	1
	then morries hyundai in suburban minneapolis had it in the minneapolis startribune that they had one.	1
	so i went there last night after work.	1
	they had a 'preproduction' model on their showroom floor.	1
	it was obviously a production model.	1
	nothing 'concept' about it.	1
	however, they told me that hyundai had told them they had to quit giving test drives so they moved it inside the showroom.	1
	salesmanager told me that they had taken it out and it was a great ride.	1
	looked very good in person.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1338#msg1338grain of salt..        well, just got back from the dealer and my 'contact' mentioned that the genesis is expected by june but the v6 models.	1
	hyundai will start delivering the v8 models and are expected to arrive at dealers by september.	1
	let's see if this holds true or hyundai makes this happen sooner rather than later.	1
	:sad:       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1339#msg1339genesis - the start of something....?	1
	i made it to the fort lauderdale auto show this past saturday, march 22nd and saw the genesis there.	1
	it was on the turn table display and just has been posted, they were allowing people to take turns checking out the car.	1
	i learned from one of the product specialist there that this was a pre-production unit and that hyundai was still fine tuning the north american version.	1
	changes?	1
	she mentioned that they would be re-working the rear seating configuration, which presently seats two, to three seating.	1
	she said the changes were being made based on feedback hyundai had received from prospective buyers.	1
	she also mentioned that there would be additional changes but declined to go into details or specifics.	1
	impressions:                 my reaction to the car's exterior was hyundai got this right.	1
	it has an impressive, if understated elegance.	1
	the interior is also impressive as well.	1
	this model had a dark interior.	1
	the detail stitching, not to mention the comfortable leather seating is a major plus.	1
	surveying the high quality soft touch materials, the fit and finish of even this pre-production genesis model shows how seriously dedicated hyundai is on delivering on their claims of luxury.	1
	i played with the center control knob near the shifter and although the dash was not powered, i could detect incremental clicks as it was turned.	1
	also more impressive was the gauge cluster, which is on par with any sedan from lexus.	1
	again fit and finish in the driver and passenger cockpit area was superb.	1
	there was a crowd building around the display when i eventually stepped out of the genesis and a line of people were anxiously waiting to check the car out.	1
	i can say without hesitation that this car is generating the right buzz for hyundai and depending on final pricing, packaging, etc, this maybe the marque star that will get more people talking about and seriously considering hyundai than ever before.       	1

	[carbunt]        i would have to agree with your perceptions of the genesis exterior.	1
	however, i'm a bit jealous that you got to examine the interior as i did not.	1
	however, as the car turned on the pedestal with it's doors open, i could tell (even from 1-15 feet away) that the interior was very nice.	1
	it was inviting, it made me want to sit in the car.	1
	i haven't even gotten to touch the genesis yet and it' s already making me question doin the illogical move of trading in a paid for '06 azera to take on a new car note!	1
	will it actually happen, i doubt it...my logical side always seems to win those arguments.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1343#msg1343re: time limit [allmet33]         starting out just north of $38k.	1
	if you get it loaded with various items like the body kit, 18' alloys, side window visors, carbon fiber trim on the interior...msrp jumps to just under $45k                                first of all, all the things that you mentioned like the body kit and window visors are not options but                 dealer add-ons                .	1
	as matter of fact the tl-s has no additional option because it comes loaded with the navi and carbon fiber trim.	1
	the true market value (what people are paying) for a tl-s according to edmunds is $34,880.	1
	the msrp is $39,140 and invoice is $36,016, all including destination charge).	1
	so no, the genesis wouldn't be $10k less than the tl-s.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1344#msg1344re: time limit [louiswei]        that's funny, because if you go to the acura website, you can build one and add everything i mentioned.	1
	not sure which tl-s you're looking at, but the one i selected with tranny showed a tmv price of $36,114.	1
	which puts it in line price-wise, but bang for buck...genesis beats it out.	1
	the coupe shouldn't go for more than $33-34k and the sedan in 3.8 v-6 form shouldn't be over that as well...that being said...winner, genesis!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1345#msg1345re: time limit [allmet33]        well, those are the dealer add-ons, but factory options from acura.	1
	put in zip code 90505 then you'll get the $34,880 tmv.	1
	sure if a loaded 3.8 v6 genesis has a msrp of under $35k then it'll definitely win the best bang for the buck award.	1
	however, if i am a betting man i wouldn't bet on the genesis to top tl-s performance wise.	1
	the straightline performance will be a crapshoot given that the less weight for tl-s but it'll definitely walk all over the genesis at the turns and on curvy roads.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1346#msg1346re: time limit [louiswei]        base msrp for the tl-s automatic is $38,940, including destination.	1
	that price includes navigation.	1
	the reason acura dealers are selling them around invoice, or a little below invoice, is that the tl has been mostly unchanged since 2004.                                base msrp for the genesis 3.8l will be somewhere between $33,000 to $34,000, including destination.	1
	add the navigation package, and the msrp will be somewhere between $35,000 to $36,000, which is still about $3,000 to $4,000 less than the comparably-equipped tl-s.  also, hyundai has a history of selling cars at invoice, or even a couple thousand below invoice, on a regular basis.	1
	i would guess that, while the genesis is the new flagship and won't be selling at or below invoice for a while, there will at least be some smaller incentives that will take $1,000 or $1,500 off msrp not too long after they show up at dealerships.	1
	as far as handling is concerned, nobody has done an official road test of the genesis, so we can only guess at this point.	1
	with a 53/47 front/rear weight ratio, and the sophisticated suspension design, i wouldn't be surprised if it handles at least as well as the tl-s.  we'll see in the next few months.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1347#msg1347u        uh....                                the tl type-s 6mt has superb handling.	1
	it mops bathroom, kitchen room, even the basement floor with the '07 g35 sport and lexus is350 in the track.	1
	how in the hell genesis sedan could keep up with that *thing*...........   the genesis v8 weighs 4000 lbs flat.	1
	that's quite a weight yah.	1
	the suspension system on the genesis is very good on paper, but i don't know how stiff the spring rate would be.	1
	the weight alone will have difficulty staying up with the type-s 6mt in the tracks like willow springs international raceway, or more sophiticated euro tracks like silverstone, donington park, oulton park, croft, brands hatch, or better knockhill....  there is no way in hell genesis could keep up there ho ho.......... but then, you never know... maybe genesis has something really special underneath that car....   that's rite, we haven't actually driven the genesis yet.	1
	but i just don't think the genesis sedan is a track car......                                take a genesis coupe to compete with the tl type-s 6mt....  the type-s 6mt has even stiffer and more responsive handling than the auto version due to track tuned suspension from factory.	1
	the damn thing uses a solid, thick anti-roll bar it's crazy.	1
	uh huh... yup uh huh yea yea i own one rite now, not the type-s version but the regular version 6mt.	1

	air_scoops, you took the words right out of my mouth.	1
	whoever thinks that the genesis would be able to hang with the tl-s need to read road  track's japanese sports sedan comparison in the 02/07 issue.	1
	by the way, is that your tl-s?	1
	looks sharp!	1
	too bad you are not in cali        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1349#msg1349re: u [air_scoops]        i'll bet handling would be a different story at a track, when pushing both cars to their threshold.	1
	the genesis 3.8l weighs about 200 lbs more than the tl-s, and i'm sure the suspension in the genesis is tuned more softly than the tl-s.  in real world driving, though, i'm sure the genesis will feel as composed and confident as the tl-s during 'spirited' driving.	1
	the fact is, most sedan drivers have never gone to a track, and never will.	1
	the typical sedan driver thinks he's really 'pushing the limits' when he pulls .60g around a corner, well below the grip limits of most midsize and large sedans.	1
	the genesis is supposed to be more of a 'poor man's m35 / m45 / gs350 / gs460;' a big, luxurious, fast sedan that also feels sporty in everyday driving.	1
	i think the genesis will be very attractive to people who are looking for those qualities, but don't have $45,000 - $55,000 to spend on a car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1350#msg1350re: u [air_scoops]        air scoops:                                1st props.	1
	assuming the car in the photo is yours definitely....sharp.	1
	a great looking car.	1
	.	1
	that said, i have to chip in a few thoughts as a 'former' owner of an '04 tl, 6-speed, with the brembo front brakes, and firmer factory suspension.	1
	just for laughs, i tossed the oem 'summer' performance tires (bridgestones) for pirelli pzero's when i owned it.	1
	the tl is pure bliss in a straight line and sweeping turns, but push it through tighter more 'technical' back roads/track situations and the 'limitations' are exposed.	1
	acura nailed the engine/transmission part of the equation.	1
	the problem with the car is physics.	1
	fwd packaging in a car over say 3,300 lbs just compromises the handling versus a well sorted rwd car.	1
	just can't put the power down effectively.	1
	said differently, switch off the traction control and drive your car...especially in the rain with your foot down.	1
	that is why i got rid the tl.	1
	great except for the hard core handling dynamics.	1
	while they are overpriced, that's why every 'm' performance bmw is rwd.	1
	if you have not driven an m car, you have to.	1
	watch the recent 'test drive' of the '08 m3 v8 on a wet skidpad on speedtv.	1
	i agree with all the 'buzz' the hyundai has the potential to do some major damage in the market place with the genesis.	1
	i think we all have to 'turn a wheel' in an actual production version before all the final determinations can be made.	1
	if it drives well enough and shows up at the right price point, put me down for a v8 version, skip the navi.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1351#msg1351re: u [air_scoops]        i hate to burst your bubble, but...the acura tl and or the type-s variant are superb handling when compared to other fwd cars.	1
	as it's been stated, probably the best handling fwd vehicle to date.	1
	however...the fact that is fwd, it's automatically at a disadvantage when compared to a rwd vehicle.	1
	i can't say for sure that the genesis sedan or coupe will out handle a tl or tl-s, however...the fact that both are rwd give it an upper hand.	1
	can't quite say on the sedan, but the coupe...i would think that hyundai's intentions are to give it a sport tuned suspension which would be stiffer than that on the sedan.	1
	that being said, the coupe would probably be able to hold it's own quite nicely, especially against the tl-s.                                will it be possible for the tl-s to out accelerate the genesis...maybe, but don't hold your breath.	1
	i'm really, really interested in the genesis dropping so that they can be offically tested to put all speculation to rest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1352#msg1352re: u [louiswei]        louis...the only thing i'll say is...don't sleep.	1
	granted, the tl-s gets much praise for it's ability to handle as well as it does as a fwd sedan, but we're talking about pitting it against a rwd sport coupe with more power.	1
	the only thing that would really hold the genesis back is weight, and right now...we don't have any speculative info on how heavy it may be.	1
	i would hate to see it tip the scales at anything over what the g37 weighs.	1
	however, the tl isn't exactly light either, at just over 3500 lbs...if the genesis coupe comes in around the same weight, the tl wouldn't stand a chance.	1
	i say this because we're talking about two cars that weigh about the same, but...one with more power, about the same amount of torque, all coupled with rwd.	1
	i hate to say it, but i would put my money on the genesis coupe...if...by chance it should weigh in close to what the tl-s weighs.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1353#msg1353re: u [allmet33]         granted, the tl-s gets much praise for it's ability to handle as well as it does as a fwd sedan, but we're talking about pitting it against a rwd sport coupe with more power.	1
	apparently you didn't read my last post, like i said, in rt's comparison the tl-s held its own against other                 rwd                japanese sports sedans like the g35 and is350.	1
	are you telling me that the genesis would perform better than those two?	1
	of course there is a possibility but given the size, weight and horsepower i wouldn't bet my money on it.	1
	by the way, i wasn't comparing about the genesis coupe since last i checked, it has only 2 doors?       	1

	the sts (non-v) is rwd, does it have the upper hand on tl-s?	1

	the question arises, would the numbers be different if all three were outfitted with the same tires (tires can make a huge difference).	1
	however, flat out straight-line acceleration...the tl-s came in last...the is350 literally crushed it by almost a full second in 0-60 and around the 1/4 mile mark, the tl-s was behind the is350 by almost 2 full seconds.	1
	so...like i said before, the only thing that will hold the genesis back will be it's weight.	1

	dude, either you need an eye exam or your math skill has be degrading tremendously...                                the bottom line is that although it is fwd but it has the performance to hang with the rwd                 small                sports sedans.	1
	given the weight, size and horsepower of the genesis, performance wise my money is on the tl-s.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1359#msg1359impressions from sitting in genesis        here's my impressions from my brief time in, but not being able to drive, the car.	1
	the exterior looked very upscale.	1
	i didn't like the bright work at the bottom of the sides, i thought it distracting from the solid look of the car.	1
	back up camera integrated nicely.	1
	the fuel filler door was a complete cheap piece of plastic.	1
	inside, the car was impressive.	1
	the doors were solid.	1
	the leather stitched on the dash looked very rich and detailed nicely.	1
	the gauge cluster lit up and looked like a sts or lexus es, except it had a small box for information like an audi.	1
	large, well integrated nav screen that shows back up video.	1
	the main nav controller appeared to operate more like the audi than the bmw.	1
	i couldn't get through all of the menus.	1
	i've never had a controller like that but it would take some getting used to.	1
	the stereo had an in-dash cd changer and a central counsel ipod port.	1
	the seats were much more on the comfortable than the sporty side.	1
	it was cushy like the lexus or mb, rather than sporty and hard like the acura, etc.	1
	the back seat was very room and comfortable, though without much eye-candy.	1
	i would compare it to the avalon.	1
	overall the interior was stylish like the vera cruz.	1
	driving will make the decision.	1
	i got the feeling they really did try to take the best from most of the cars slightly above their price point and integrate the ideas.	1
	for the most part it works.	1
	some of the switch gear still feels cheap ... like the azera.	1
	overall my impression was extremely positive.	1
	does hyundai have experience with rear-wheel drive sedans?	1
	my concern is driving in heavy snow and ice.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1360#msg1360re: u [louiswei]        as far as skid pad numbers go...we'll just have to see.	1
	i never said the genesis would 'crush' the performance numbers of the tl-s, so don't put words in my mouth...thank you very much.	1
	however...you are the one that needs the eye exam, there's nothing wrong with my math...if you go back to my post i said the is350, not the g35.	1
	last time i checked...14.3 vs. 12.7 is almost 2 full seconds difference (4/10ths of a second away from it to be exact).	1
	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...the cars the tl-s is compared to are not small.	1
	that would be the is250 and acura tsx.	1
	however, i do admit that the tl-s is a fine fwd sport sedan and have said so already.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1361#msg1361re: u [allmet33]         14.3 vs. 12.7 is almost 2 full seconds difference (4/10ths of a second away from it to be exact).	1
	uh... excuse me but i failed to see where on that sheet says is350 ran a 1/4-mile in 12.7 seconds.	1
	here's your original statement: '                 is350 literally crushed it by almost a full second in 0-60 and around the 1/4 mile mark, the tl-s was behind the is350 by almost 2 full seconds.                '	1

	yeah, you should make an appointment right now...                                 ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...the cars the tl-s is compared to are not small                                sigh... you are just not getting what i was trying to say.	1
	it doesn't matter what the tl-s' size is but the important thing is that                  it is able to hang with the other small rwd sports sedans                 .	1
	if that's the case, the genesis would have to be able to hang with the g35 and is350 performance wise in order to be able to hang with the tl-s. in mathematical terms:                                if                 tl-s = g35 = is350                , the only way that                 genesis = tl-s                is true is when                 genesis = g35 = is350                .	1
	genesis = g35 = is350 in performance?	1
	yeah right...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1362#msg1362re: u [louiswei]        okay...go back and look at the sheet.	1
	if you notice i said 'around' the 1/4 mile mark.	1
	if you look at the sheet...they all hit the 1/4 mile around the 100 mph mark (give or take a few), thus...i said 'around' the 1/4 mile mark.	1
	notice, i did not say at the 1/4 mile mark.	1
	okay...so to be specific...at the 100 mph mark, the is350 was almost a full 2 seconds ahead of the tl-s...is that better for you?	1
	so...anyway, no eye appointments needed.	1
	it would be true if tl-s = g35 = is350, but that is not the case.	1
	even rt said it...while the tl-s held it's own, overall...it came in 3rd place compared to the other two...last i checked...3rd place doesn't equal 2nd or 1st place.	1
	in mathematical terms.        	1

	in mathematical terms.	1
	uh...                                you'll need to read that article again, the tl-s beat out the g35 and came in 2nd place.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1364#msg1364re: u [louiswei]        oooops!	1
	my apologies on that slip up.	1
	remember when we were talking about the tl and the azera?	1
	1/4 miles times for azera                                now...if a tl-s pulls the 1/4 mile in 14.3 secs.	1
	99.9 mph and the azera pulls it 14.8 secs.	1
	97.6 mph.	1
	why would you find it so inconceivable for me to post that i pulled away from a regular tl???	1
	heck, the azera with less power (263 hp and just over 3600 lbs) and more weight is right behind the tl-s, you don't think the genesis is capable with more power and a little more weight???	1
	i'm curious to understand your logic.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1365#msg1365re: u [allmet33]         you don't think the genesis is capable with more power and a little more weight???	1
	i'm curious to understand your logic.	1
	like i said before, in straight line performance between the tl-s and genesis it'll be a crapshoot (or a drivers' race).	1
	well, at least for the 0-60 that'll be the case and i wouldn't be surprised if the genesis pulls away at the 1/4-mile mark given its higher horsepower.	1
	however, you can look back at all my posts, i was never concentrated on the straight line performance itself.	1
	what i was questioning is whether or not the genesis will have the driving dynamics to hang with the tl-s through curves and on twisty roads.	1
	0.91g on skidpad and 66 mph through slalom are very impressive figures, i will be very surprised if the genesis is able to top that.	1
	my logic?	1
	my logic is that straight line performance isn't everything.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1366#msg1366re: u [louiswei]        you are correct, it isn't everything, but it's a lot of what most folks base bragging rights on.	1
	anyway...i truly think weight will be the main issue here.	1
	if you look at the azera, it could be lighter if hyundai used a bit more aluminum in the build of the car, but used steel instead.	1
	i don't think that trend will change much with the genesis.	1
	however, with that in mind...i think the genesis will be much more of a dynamic performer than anyone is willing to give it credit for.	1
	will it post skid pad #'s of the tl-s...probably not, will it come close...maybe.	1
	considering the weight issue, that would impressive in itself.	1
	it would make me wonder just what it would be capable of if the genesis were as svelte as the tl-s.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1367#msg1367re: u [allmet33]        bragging rights are worth what again?	1
	it's about the total package to me.	1
	yes, if you want to drag, it's a good thing but remember weight is everything so 30 hp less but with 400 lbs less weight, the 1/4 mile goes to slim fast contender (given a similar power/torque ratio).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1368#msg1368re: u [circlew]        why are we even discussing the tls in the realm of the genesis sedan?	1
	i was under the impression that the gen. sedan is going to be significantly larger than a tls ever would be, so by default the tls will out handle it.	1
	like  i said earlier, this car isn't meant for the track, so all this 1/4 mile talk and handling stuff is irrelivent to 95% of the buyers.	1
	it would be like me saying that my nissan armada can't hang with a toyota tacoma x-runner.	1
	well duh, obviously my armada has a different purpose than an x-runner!	1

	99.9 mph and the azera pulls it 14.8 secs.	1
	97.6 mph.	1
	why would you find it so inconceivable for me to post that i pulled away from a regular tl???	1
	heck, the azera with less power (263 hp and just over 3600 lbs) and more weight is right behind the tl-s, you don't think the genesis is capable with more power and a little more weight???	1
	i'm curious to understand your logic.	1
	what the hell is this guy smoking..                                the tl type-s 6mt runs 0-60 in 5.5 sec and 14.1 sec                101 mph according to the latest review from cardriver.	1
	even the regular tl 6mt(2004~ 2006) gets 14.3 sec                99 mph.	1
	the regular tl 6mt will walk all over the azera.	1
	it's not even in the same competition..   now if you are talking azera beating the regular tl 5at would be acceptable as the tl auto tranny cars have tall gear ratios.	1
	the tl type-s and regular tl 6mt are very competiting cars.	1
	there is very small difference....                                as for the genesis, i would say only the v8 version *can* beat the tl type-s 6mt in the accelerations.	1
	the v6 3.8 genesis version........ isnt enough to take out the tl type-s 6mt.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1373#msg1373re: u [louiswei]         like i said before, in straight line performance between the tl-s and genesis it'll be a crapshoot (or a drivers' race).	1
	well, at least for the 0-60 that'll be the case and i wouldn't be surprised if the genesis pulls away at the 1/4-mile mark given its higher horsepower.	1
	however, you can look back at all my posts, i was never concentrated on the straight line performance itself.	1
	what i was questioning is whether or not the genesis will have the driving dynamics to hang with the tl-s through curves and on twisty roads.	1
	0.91g on skidpad and 66 mph through slalom are very impressive figures, i will be very surprised if the genesis is able to top that.	1
	my logic?	1
	my logic is that straight line performance isn't everything.	1
	louiswei, you nailed it.	1
	you got the concept totally right.	1
	nice job.	1
	btw, even better, the type-s 6mt was measured 0.93 g on the 300ft skid pad testing by cardriver.	1

	secondly...you would have to have been a part of the original argument that was posted a while back when i stated that i beat a tl with my azera.	1
	let me clarify...it was not a tl-s.                                my reason for posting what i posted was simply this...the azera is capable of being not far off from the acceleration numbers of the tl-s (which numbers i got from a rt data sheet...link is a few posts back).	1
	the orignal argument was that the azera shouldn't be able to hang with a tl and the poster couldn't accept the fact that i had made the statement.	1
	i had clearly posted that it was the regular tl not the tl-s                                in terms of acceleration, i brought this up to point to show that with the numbers of the tl-s as compared to the numbers of the azera...why would it be so hard to believe that the genesis might be capable of out running the tl-s (auto or manual)???	1
	i can't speak in terms of handling as nobody has put a genesis (sedan or coupe) through the paces.	1
	i can understand if the genesis were to have some regular tranny in it, but the v-6 version will have the aisin 6 speed auto tranny and the v-8 versions will get the zf 6 speed tranny, not exactly weak run of the mill trannies.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1385#msg1385re: thank you [bucwild]        it's easy to make comparisons on paper when you have numbers to work with.	1
	however, some of us that do it realize it's merely specualtion.	1
	i have my wishes as to what i would like to see the genesis be capable of, but in reality...it depends on quite a few things and those things can't be determined until an actual car has been driven to find out what its about.	1
	based on pics you seen and numbers you've seen thrown around concerning hp...it's hard not to speculate.	1
	i mean...you can draw a pretty definitive conclusion about how it looks from the pics.	1
	that's half the battle there because the car has to make you want to look at it, right?	1
	based on your post, it has done that much.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1394#msg1394what a letdown        is anyone else disappointed in the newest 'production' photos versus the original concept photos from the ny auto show?	1
	the vehicle in the concept photos blew me away.	1
	i was especially impressed by four elements:                1. the amazing-looking front grille                2. the even more amazing looking front headlights                3. the sleek fog lights                4. the twin, flat tailpipes.	1
	in the newest photos that i am seeing here, all four of those elements have changed between now and then, and none of them changed for the better, in my opinion.	1
	- the new grille looks strange, and i don't mean in a good way.	1
	- the new headlights and foglights look...well, ordinary.	1
	they are nothing that would grab anyone's attention.	1
	- the tailpipes are nice, but not as nice as the concept version.	1
	color me very disappointed in this one, if this is the way it turns out.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1395#msg1395re: objection [air_scoops]         yea.... got prob with that?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1396#msg1396re: what a letdown [walkinge]        have you really looked at the concept model as opposed to the production model???	1
	i've gone over this in a previous posting, but anyway...                                when have you ever known a company to produce a vehicle as it was seen as a concept?	1
	okay...the front grille..pretty much the same too (except for the lower grille).	1
	the headlights really aren't changed (look again).	1
	not sure what 'sleek' fog lights you're referring to, there are no fog lights on the concept...just some chrome trim around the opening where fog lights would go.	1
	don't believe me...take a look here:                 genesis coupe concept front view                                the tail pipes are pretty much the same as well, which isn't a flat shape at all (you sure you're looking at the genesis coupe concept?)	1
	genesis coupe concept rear view                                anyway...the lines of the car itself are pretty much intact except for the lower sides where the concept has air vents for the rear brakes and the production doesn't.	1
	the other biggest difference is the carbon fiber hood on the concept with the vents and the production gets a regular hood.	1
	well...for hyundai to produce the coupe in the form you see as the concept, one would pay a hefty premium and maybe (if hyundai's smart) they'll make those upgrades available for that premium price.	1
	however, for hyundai to bring this car to market and fit it in the value niche that they've established themselves in...you're simply not going to see the concept model as a production car.	1
	sorry, but i'm sure if you want the look...there will be aftermarket parts available for one to jazz it up any way you might want.	1
	who knows...maybe hyundai will get a wild hair up their wazoo and produce a version that looks like the concept and shoehorn the 4.6 v-8 in it and call it the gt.	1
	wish hard enough and if you're a good boy, santa might put one under the tree for you in a couple years!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1397#msg1397re: what a letdown [allmet33]        allmet33,                i wasn't referring to the coupe, but to the sedan.	1
	forgive me if i posted this in the wrong area, as i am new to this forum.	1
	i thought this area was to discuss either the genesis coupe or sedan.	1
	in any case, the photos i am referring to are from the new york auto show.	1
	the link is here, and if you click on the lead photo you will see a gallery of high-res pictures:                 http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/04/new-york-auto-show-hyundai-starts-over-with-t- he-genesis/                                i understand that concept cars often don't end up looking like production cars.	1
	it's just that in this instance, all the elements that i loved in the concept car were changed for the production version i see pictured on the inside line page for the genesis sedan (or the 'very close to production' version, as i'm under the impression that it's still not finalized).	1
	i don't know enough about cars to know if it's even humanly possible to make functional headlights, foglights and tailpipes like the ones pictures on the link above (they are quite sleek, after all).	1
	maybe it isn't, and i was just being a dreamer all along.	1
	the grille ... eh, i just don't like this new grille at all.	1
	one of the nice features of the concept grille was the mesh behind it, and that is also gone.	1
	is it still a nice car?	1
	sure, it's nice, but it's not '                 i gotta have it                ' nice in my book.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1398#msg1398re: what a letdown [walkinge]        well...considering both are called the genesis, you pretty much have to specify which one you're referring to so we can follow along.	1
	i thought it was the coupe because another poster had taken issue with the changes between the concept and production versions.	1
	anyway...it's hard not to love the ideas and elements when you see them on a concept car...it's all about fantasy and drawing attention, but also applying ideas for the future.	1
	you ask if it's possible to make headlights like the ones on the concept genesis sedan.	1
	anything is possible, the real question is can it be financialy feasible at this point.	1
	there is a lot of work going on with led headlights and i think at some point, that will be the way companies go.	1
	i understand about the grille, however...there is a site online that will be selling grilles for the genesis sedan                 korean auto imports                                                                i can respect your opinion about the genesis not being an 'i gotta have it.'	1
	car.	1
	in some cases pictures online don't do a car justice.	1
	it definitely looks better in person, i just wish i had been able to get a taste of the interior from actually sitting in it and not a peek from 15-20 feet away.	1
	there have been posters that have had the opportunity to sit in one and all of them have posted that the interior is wonderfully done.	1
	is the genesis the end all, be all sedan...absolutely not.	1
	the fact that it's a hyundai and looks like it does with the performance that it may be capable of...well, that makes it quite a bit more appealing when you look at it in those terms.	1
	i can honestly say, being a hyundai fan...i like the genesis, but...it hasn't made me say that i'm willing to give up my paid for '06 azera to take on a car note for one.	1

	[gleen6191]        over a year ago when the genesis was announced at 'starting' under 30k, the dollar was much stronger.	1
	the dollar has since weakened substantially and i would be stunned if they could start the genesis under 34k.	1
	maybe they could strip it down more to reduce costs and shift some of the 'standard' features as options, but the dollar just doesn't buy nearly as much on the foreign markets as it did just a year ago.	1
	i would say that the impact of the weakening dollar alone will impact the pricing by at least 2-4 thousand dollars.	1
	if they want to 'appear' to keep their commitment at 'starting under 30k', i think they'll need to strip down the standard features and offer them as options.	1
	regardless, i think the v6 3.8  fully optioned will be in the 38k range -- or about 6-8k more than an azera.	1
	the v8 version fully optioned will probably run about 44k.	1

	the price tag of the genesis may be fixed  [leemy386]        as i know, the dealer was told by hyundai korea executives about the price line.	1
	it's not just the dealer's opinion.	1
	ok, it's not determined yet, but whatever they disucss, the price would be somewhere near 32k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1410#msg1410re: thank you [jeansyc]        frankly, that's a bit demanding.	1
	this is a discussion forum, located in our 'future vehicles' section.	1
	it's a good place for people to speculate and talk about what they hope this vehicle will be like.	1
	many times, it's impossible to find facts because they either don't exist, or are proprietary company info.	1
	we're all just consumers - no one from hyundai, to my knowledge, is posting in here.       	1

	i've used it in an infiniti m and cadillac sts.	1
	i've seen it advertised by m/b and lexus.	1
	in the sts it works great.	1
	i would really like it if i were to look at the genesis.	1
	it appears that it will be packaged only in the most expensive packages ... if the speculation is correct.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1414#msg1414re: list of vehicles with adaptive cruise control [mnjasper]        thanks for your response.	1
	the announced presence of adaptive cruise control in the genesis is one of the main reasons i became interested in the car.	1
	however, nowhere i look do i see that will be standard across the 3 models.	1
	if advanced cruise control is standard, then i will be interested in looking further when the genesis is in the showroom.	1
	for those who may wish to know, lane departure warning from mobileye is available for aftermarket installation,                 only                in mclean, va or toronto, canada in the eastern us and eastern canada.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1415#msg1415genesis concept sport-sedan vs production lux-sedan        i'm not sure if some viewers agree with this version, but to me hyundai had a hot sizzlin design with genesis concept-sedan that appeared at the 2007 ny auto-show compare to more so of a luxury production-sedan that is due out summer 2008. now both designs concept and production are nice!	1
	but the facial to the rear of the production 2009 genesis-sedan kind of mimic the mercedes-benz s class which msrp range from: $86,000 to $194,000 (big price ouch!	1
	for me).	1
	i'm not saying the genesis-s is much comparison to the benz-s class they just look similar.	1
	so as far as quality, refinement and value i just leave that to auto experts.	1
	meanwhile hyundai should really consider the genesis concept sport-sedan design to the production line.	1
	genesis concept-ss has very unique design with head  taillights along with hood / front  back skirt.	1
	this concept design would definitely will run-up against bimmer 5 series, infiniti m's and lexus gs series.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1416#msg1416genesis-sedan leather-wrapped steering wheel        today most vehicles are standard or available option of leather-wrapped steering wheel along with convenience features such as radio, cruise and hands-free phone tabs.	1
	and some vehicles with leather-wrapped steering wheel maybe heated.	1
	for me starting and driving my car during early cold mornings and nights when the temperature 32.f or below the freezing point of winter season can be pretty harsh at times.	1
	but with heated leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather seats these is a wonderful convenience features to have.	1
	i maybe unsure when it the time comes to sale or trade my infiniti and the cars im searching for do not have these heated-features.	1
	does anyone know if this feature is available on genesis-sedan?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1417#msg1417re: genesis concept sport-sedan vs production lux-sedan [veragen]        looks 99% like my 2007 fing m35x which is a beauty....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1418#msg1418re: thank you [jeansyc]        my guess wasn't even a guess, i was being sarcastic.	1
	you want something that none of us can supply you with.	1
	the information we get comes from press releases that we see either in publication or snippets found on the internet on various web sites that deal with upcoming cars and such.	1
	there is quite a bit of info that can be found on the genesis if one really looks, the question really is...how accurate and valid is the information found.	1
	if you start seeing info that seems consistent you sorta stick with it until you see something that changes it.	1
	case in point...                                how valid is this information...can't really tell you, but it's info that was found out on the net.	1
	as you notice, cruise control is listed under the 3.8 standard package (no mention of adaptive), but...as you go up in packages...it's not mentioned again.	1
	i would be left to assume that the cruise control on the 3.8 v-6  4.6 v-8 would be the adaptive cruise control.	1
	could it be on the 3.3 v-6...sure it could, but there's nothing stating that it will be.	1
	with hyundai stating the genesis will start under $30k, i'll bet that the 3.3 v-6 model won't get it, among a few other things.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1419#msg1419re: when is the genesis for sale?????	1
	[ricwhite]        the base model (sedan) will start under 30k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1420#msg1420re: when is the genesis for sale?????	1
	[dborth]        it's not.	1
	the coupe could start under 20k for the tuner ready i4 turbo version.	1
	to get to 30k, you might need to load up every option, factory, port, or dealers.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1422#msg1422re: thank you [jeansyc]         my son was at the 2008 ny auto show.	1
	hyundai did not have brochures available.	1
	no one had much to offer.	1
	recall years ago, most show goers would come back from the auto show with a bag of goodies.	1
	few far and between nowadays - almost nothing from most automakers in recent years.	1
	fwiw, i believe hyundai had brochures of its 2008 lineup out for takes, as do a few others.	1
	most automakers didn't even have any info readily available.	1
	as for the genesis sedan, an introductory brochure should be arriving at us showrooms in a week.	1
	a more detailed one will become available in june.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1423#msg1423re: thank you [joe97]        one thing i've found about hyundai when it comes to their sound systems...the count coaxial speakers seperately.	1
	so...if you had a pair of coaxial speakers for the center channel, that's 4.  then...a pair of mids and tweets in the front doors, that's 4 more.	1
	rear doors...same thing, that's another 4, then...the rear deck would house a pair of mid drivers and a sub...that's 3 more, for a grand total of 15 speakers my friend.	1
	is it overkill...yeah, in my mind it is.	1
	however, lexicon is the creme de la creme when it comes to sound systems.	1
	it's only found in one other car and that's the rolls royce phantom.	1
	go figure, but since the azera and veracruz have infinity as their top flight stereo systems, they turned to the same company (harman-becker) as lexicon is under their umbrella as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1424#msg1424re: genesis-sedan leather-wrapped steering wheel [veragen]        one thing you can find on the hyundai web-site is that the genesis doesn't have a heated steering wheel, however...while it may be leather wrapped, it's treated somehow to be reflective of heat so that even if the steering wheel is sitting in direct sunlight...it will not be hot to the touch when you jump in and grab the wheel.	1
	personally, i've never had an issue with a leather wrapped steering wheel being too cold, it's the ones with the faux wood on them that are a monster on those cold days.	1
	excuse me for my ignorance...what cars have heated steering wheels??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1425#msg1425re: thank you [allmet33]        well, a hyundai official pricing list (preli or final) would list the lexicon having 17 speakers, and not 15...that's how you spot a fake                                there was a few other things that didn't look right but the lexicon was the biggest flaw.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1426#msg1426re: thank you [joe97]        something you speak of, but can't post something to show as proof?	1
	if 15 speakers are hard enough to get in, where would two more go my friend?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1429#msg1429re: thank you [joe97]        okay...missing 2 speakers doesn't make it that bad.	1
	i can understand if they had stated that the 3.8 v-6 was supposed to have 325 hp or something like that.	1
	other than missing 2 speakers and not mentioning something about a base trim...can the information be that far off?	1
	the pricing...i believe is a bit off, but we'll have to see.	1
	as far as speculation on equipment...it's not going to be 100% accurate since hyundai hasn't put out anything more than what's on their website.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1436#msg1436re: thank you [joe97]        lol  well...i never took it as an official options list, just something to go by.	1
	something more to speculate until hyundai decides to stop playing close to the vest and lay their cards down.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1437#msg1437re: thank you [joe97]        well...the 3.3 base model is one that has been talked about for quite a while now.	1
	personally...it doesn't make sense to me.	1
	i would leave it out and just go with the 3.8 and the 4.6.  if you want it for under $30k, then you get a base model with no frills.	1
	the msrp for the 3.8 fully loaded may be around $35k, but...i can see folks paying around $32-33k for them.	1
	fully loaded 4.6...msrp may be around $40k, but...out the door may be more like $37-38k.	1
	when the azera first was coming out, they were talking about how it was the first $30k hyundai, this, that and the other.	1
	i went in thinking $30k, but my out the door price was just under $27k and that was for the limited w/premium package.	1
	the ultimate package was only $1500 more.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1439#msg1439re: genesis-sedan leather-wrapped steering wheel [tjc78]        well...for anyone that lives in the south...it may not be something that makes sense.	1
	up north where it can get frigid during the winter...it makes a lot of sense.	1
	now, like i said before...with the leather wrapped steering wheel, i never had an issue with cold steering wheel, but when you have the likes of what is in the azera....that fake wood section can be quite cold to the touch initially.	1
	would a heated version be nice...sure, but...i simply grab the section that's leather and keep it moving.	1
	i know the i30 was one of the few cars that offered heated rear seats...especially in it's price segment.	1
	the other option...a pair of driving gloves!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1440#msg1440re: thank you [allmet33]        i see and comprehend your case in point.	1
	i appreciate your detailed response.	1
	as a case in point from this 80 year young guy, 'assumptions are fatal'.	1
	thus far, i am enamoured of the genesis.	1
	this will be the last car i own if it lives up to my expectations.	1
	that is why i am so concerned with knowing the                 facts                about the car.	1
	now that i have a better understanding about the forum from you and kirsti, i will look at postings with a more educated eye.	1
	thank you again for your contributions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1441#msg1441re: thank you [jeansyc]        assumptions can, indeed...be fatal, however...when it comes to speculation about a vehicle that hasn't been dropped yet...speculation is pretty much all you have.	1
	the facts as they are known...can be found on the hyundai usa website.	1
	the car itself is generating a lof of buzz and rightfully so.	1
	for the price that this car will be offered (in any trim level), it will be hard to beat from a value standpoint.	1
	the real question is...will the car be good enough to actually be respected.	1
	the genesis has the potential to take hyundai to a whole new level and it seems like they are positioned to run with it.	1
	it's sad because the azera could have been the one to change everything if they had just gotten behind it like the genesis.	1
	well...at least until more substantiative information is available, we can only state the known facts and speculate about the rest.	1
	small details about what features will be available across the board is defintely a gray area as the hyundai site doesn't list the 3 trims that are supposed to be available.	1
	one can speculate that it was an accidental omission, or...maybe the idea to have the 3.3 v-6 in the gensis was scrapped.	1
	i mean...outside of the 300/charger...what other car offers 3 different powerplants in the same car???	1
	i say leave the 3.3 as the azera base trim powerplant and let the 3.8 be that in the genesis base trim level.	1
	just my opinion though.	1
	by the way, if you should happen to hear anything...post it so we can have something more to talk about in here.	1
	i think we've beat the sedan and coupe in every way imaginable to this point.	1
	we are all simply waiting on test drives!!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1442#msg1442re: thank you [allmet33]        thanks again for your comprehensive postings.	1
	i do appreciate them.	1
	as far as my posting information goes, i only have the internet and my local dealer as sources.	1
	from a salesperson at hyundai of nanuet, ny, literature on the genesis may be in 30 to 60 days.	1
	again, we are dealing with guesswork.	1
	since i have no intention of signing up for indy, my 3 principal requisites in a car are electronic stability control, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning system.	1
	i know that the genesis sedan will not have lane departure warning.	1
	however, as i stated previously, that will be available aftermarket.	1
	incidentally, it is available to be installed in any vehicle.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1443#msg1443re: thank you [jeansyc]        no problem.	1
	well...at this point, you have about as much as we seem to have.	1
	personally, i'm curious about the joe97 guy...he seems to be quite factual with his postings as if he knows something we don't know.	1
	as far as the pre-requisites in your car shopping...i think you'll find more and more that will have the adaptive cruise control.	1
	the avalon already has it and i think you can get it on the camry as well.	1
	it has been said to be available on the genesis, just not sure as to which trim level (s) it will be standard on or if it'll be an option or what.	1
	esc is seemingly becoming and industry standard almost, it's showing up on a lot more cars these days.	1
	there are only a handful (if that many) that offer lane departure warning.	1
	i do believe cadillac is one company that offers is and i think infiniti does as well (not 100% sure).	1
	however, the fact that it's available as an aftermarket option opens your choices to any car that comes with apaptive cruise and esc.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1446#msg1446re: thank you [allmet33]        adaptive cruise control is available on the top trim (limited) version of the avalon; not available on the camry.	1
	esc/traction control - optional on both avalon and camry (gasoline models).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1447#msg1447re: list of vehicles with adaptive cruise control [joe97]        i agree and understand why, however...i fail to see the logic of going with the 3.3 v-6 in the base trim.	1
	they can offer the 3.8 and still manage to sell the car for under $30k if that's their goal, just offer a stripped down version and go from there.	1
	i can hardly imagine there's a huge cost difference in producing the 3.3 vs. the 3.8 since they are both engines hyundai already has and makes for other vehicles.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1448#msg1448re: list of vehicles with adaptive cruise control [allmet33]        exactly.	1
	the availability of the 3.3l isn't that much of added costs to hyundai; it does allow hyundai, however, higher fuel economy touting                and consumers will have more choices       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1449#msg1449re: list of vehicles with adaptive cruise control [joe97]        will it actually be a higher fe touting, considering the 3.3 will be hauling a little more weight than it does in the azera???	1
	we might be talking 1 or 2 mpg difference...is that really worth a choice?	1
	according to the data on edmunds.com...the fe for the azera with the 3.8 is 17/26, the numbers for the 3.3 variant is 18/26.	1
	i can't see that trend being any different for the genesis.	1
	again i ask...is it really worth it to put the 3.3 in the genesis line-up?	1

	yes indeed!!	1
	i don't know where you live, but where i am is a relatively mild climate, but it does get below freezing on a regular basis.	1
	i used to leave home around 5:15 or 5:30 in the morning for a traffic-clogged 20-30 minute drive to work and in the winter would have given just about anything to have a heated steering wheel.	1
	gloves notwithstanding!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1454#msg1454re: genesis-sedan leather-wrapped steering wheel [pat]         yes indeed!!	1
	i don't know where you live,                                chicago is the furthest south i ever spent a winter, so i am used to seeing sub zero days in winter (i actually thought spring would never come this year) and to be perfectly honest a cold steering wheel has never been an issue.	1
	if its that cold i usually keep my gloves on (yes you can drive with the things on) and by the time the interior gets warm enough to take them off the steering wheel is more than warm enough.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1482#msg1482re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[bigelm]        that is the most probable comparison, although i think their personalities are very distinct one is more performance oriented(g8) and the other is more luxury oriented(genesis).	1

	[bigelm]        i mean...choosing between the two is like deciding to go to a basketball game or going to the opera.	1
	a buddy of mine test drove the g8 gt yesterday (he has a magnum r/t).	1
	he said the g8 was nice, but...it wasn't convincing enough to make him want to give up his magnum.	1
	he said for all the hype generated, it doesn't take off like he expected it to, but it definitely has nice power.	1
	i his terms, it's not that raw power like his r/t.	1
	however, the genesis...that's gonna be the classy, pull up to the local tennis club type of car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1484#msg1484re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[allmet33]        i know these two vehicles are 'tailored' differently, but my top reason of interest is its size.	1
	i need the space and i've already gone through 3 cars in 5 yrs because my son is growing like a weed.	1
	the next car i buy, i want to hold on to it for at least 4 years.	1
	i've already test drove the g8 gt and it's a well balanced, powerful performance car.	1
	your friend's meaning of raw power probably comes from the fact that the engine is very smooth and the exhaust is silent, so you don't get the typical v8 growling; but that's nothing some aftermarket exhausts can't take care of... and some optional tuning                                i'm very impressed with the genesis (on paper) and i'm looking forward to some great reviews.	1
	the genesis and g8 are very similar, if not, identical in size.	1
	if it's as roomy as the g8, then i'm more inclined to get a genesis, especially with a rumored sc for the v8                                my wife has a 2007 sf and it's only had an o2 sensor replaced.	1
	now with ~20k miles and trouble free, hyundai is making some really good vehicles.	1
	here's hoping the genesis will be their successful halo car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1485#msg1485re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[bigelm]        well...i plan on going and getting a test ride in a g8 myself so i can see.	1
	personally, i like the quite unassuming type of power.	1
	i guess my ownership of my 86 1/2 supra back in the day spoiled me.	1
	i truly love the combination of power and grace my azera has, so i know the genesis will make me happy.	1
	on top of that, i lean more towards the look of luxury, so it would be a no brainer for me as to which one i would get.	1
	like you...i've changed cars too due to growing children and family expansion.	1
	my '02 sonata hardly offered enough leg room for my daughters to sit behind me comfortably, but the azera has taken care of that nicely.	1
	from what i've heard and seen, the genesis won't have much more room than what the azera offers already.	1
	the azera is my 3rd hyundai (first being an '87 excel)...yes, they have come so very far in terms of quality...like they jumped from the stone age to the computer age in one leap (okay, that's an exaggeration, but it seems like it).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1486#msg1486re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[allmet33]        allmet, you never told me that you had a '86.5 supra, now i definitely have more respect towards you.        	1

	[allmet33]         from what i've heard and seen, the genesis won't have much more room than what the azera offers already                                i hope that's not the case, but time will tell.	1
	i can't understand how a full size sedan like the genesis would be similar in interior space as the azera.	1
	that would be a big mistake for hyundai.	1
	although i can say, being 6'5' the space in the sf and other hyundai vehicles i've sat in, are pretty decent in interior space.	1
	- i guess i'm expecting more from a larger vehicle.	1
	the g8's interior space is incredible.	1
	i put the driver sear all the way back (barely touching the pedals) and sat in the back seat and my legs weren't even close to the back of the driver seat.	1
	and very comfortable i might add....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1488#msg1488re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[louiswei]        yeah...i got it for a steal for only $2k and loved it.	1
	only problem is...it needed a little work that i never got to do and then the timing belt went on it.	1
	by then, having 2 kids really didn't warrant getting it fixed, so i sold it to my brother-in-law for $500 and he fixed it and drove it for a while.	1
	if i could ever have one car back...it would be that one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1489#msg1489hope the dealers are better        i enjoy my current azera, but getting the car in the first place was a total nightmare.	1
	the dealerships were horrendous.	1
	it took four dealerships and traveling to a different city in order to get my azera.	1
	all i wanted was the advertised lease deal at the time.	1
	the first dealership negotiated the cap cost (about an hour) to a reasonable level, but then refused to give me the advertised money factor or residual.	1
	they told me that they didn't have to offer the advertised deal if they didn't want to and to leave if i don't like the deal  ($500 a month lease vs. $299 advertised deal.	1
	i'm not making this up).	1
	i left.	1
	the second dealership was in a nearby city.	1
	i made an appointment, got the address out of the phone book and went.	1
	the address took me to an abandoned field.	1
	i called them and got the correct address and when i showed them the phone book and the wrong printed address, they had no idea the address in the phone book was wrong.	1
	(they never looked at the advertisement or had it reviewed or had somebody else tell them about the error??)	1
	after some negotiation of cap cost and the lease deal, i asked them to run the numbers.	1
	i was left alone for over 30 minutes  (no kidding).	1
	when the guy finally came back, he looked upset.	1
	he told me that nobody could get the lease software to work on the computer.	1
	he said the guy that usually does the leases was off that day.	1
	(i was very clear when i made the appointment that i was interested in a lease).	1
	i had no choice but to leave.	1
	i left my contact information and didn't get a call back for 3 days.	1
	when i finally did get a call, the manager told me that he could only take off about $700 off the retail price which resulted in a cap cost substantially more than i had negotiated initially when i was at the dealership.	1
	no good.	1
	the third dealership was totally dishonest.	1
	they claimed that all of the 'invoice pricing' information from websites such as edmunds and all of the pricing information given to me at the other hyundai dealerships (which all matched) was wrong.	1
	the actual price of the azera was over $800 more than what all the others claimed.	1
	???	1
	right.	1
	then they started tacking on fees.	1
	the funniest one was the 'dealer name fee' of $350.	1
	they told me that was a mandatory fee for the privilege of putting the name 'ken garff' on the building.	1
	??	1
	i laughed and walked out.	1
	can you imagine this kind of nonsense going on with the hyundai genesis?	1
	an upscale market luxury vehicle?	1
	what a total joke.	1
	'i' knew a lot more about the azera than the salespeople at the hyundai dealerships.	1
	it was like walking into a store to buy expensive imported china only to find out it was a wal-mart.	1
	so, it would be far better for hyundai to have a separate dealership for the genesis, in my opinion (and experience).	1
	just to be fair.	1
	the fourth dealership  i visited (murdock hyundai in orem, utah) was excellent.	1
	very knowledgeable.	1
	i didn't have to negotiate at all.	1
	implemented the lease deal as advertised.	1
	no hidden fees.	1
	perfect.	1
	but one out of four  is a very poor record and if the same pattern holds true for selling the genesis, hyundai is in big trouble.	1
	somebody in the market for an upscale vehicle would not put up with that kind of amateurish incompetence.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1490#msg1490re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[allmet33]         from what i've heard and seen, the genesis won't have much more room than what the azera offers already.	1
	the interior volume is 2.5 cu.	1
	ft. larger than that of the azera, which will be a good upgrade in terms of size and space.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1491#msg1491re: got the order request on genesis.	1
	[joe97]        2.5 cu.	1
	ft. spread throughout the cabin can factor out to a mere inch here, half an inch there or a couple inches somewhere else.	1
	it won't seem that much bigger and still falls into line with what i said...it won't have much more room than what the azera already offers.	1
	so folks thinking they would be getting a major upgrade in interior space over the azera...don't hold your breath.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1492#msg1492info as of april 24, 2008        this is info sent to me by a hyundai dealer's salesperson.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1493#msg1493re: info as of april 24, 2008 [jeansyc]        for package 2, they have to mean 'power                 passenger                seat.'	1
	i can't believe hyundai would try to sell the genesis w/o a standard power driver's seat.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1494#msg1494re: info as of april 24, 2008 [backy]        along the same lines, i'd also think that 'tilt/telescope steering wheel' in package 2 means it's power-assisted.	1
	overall, sounds like package 2 is a very similar equipment level to the azera limited ultimate package (without navi).	1
	one issue i'm still awaiting clarification on: is the wood real or fake?	1
	it's been reported both ways.	1
	of course, it was reported as real in some early stories on the '06 azera, too.	1
	i'm guessing it's fake on the base model, real on the top model and a hearty 'dunno yet' in between.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1495#msg1495i saw a genesis today!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1500#msg1500re: hope the dealers are better [ricwhite]        ric, i agree with you 100%.	1
	when you go into a bmw or even a ford dealership, there are usually at least 3 or 4 salespeople who have been 'prepped' on new cars before they reach the dealership, and often have even test driven them at special programs.	1
	also, the service department has been prepared through training programs etc.	1
	i jumped on my azera in late january '06 just as they arrived.	1
	fortunately, for me, the dealer i had was 'with the program' and gave me the car for the exact lease program hyundai was promoting.	1
	they even through in a few 'extras'...however the service department was clueless about programming the exit/entry, doorlocks etc.	1
	i have since moved across the coast and find that the service department is polite, but not very 'up to snuff' on the latest goings on and even worse, when i walked into the sales department to ask about the genesis, a slick-talking dude was trying to tell me how 'hot' the car was going to be, how limited they were in allocation and how much over msrp they would sell for.	1
	however, he couldn't even give me any specs on the car.	1
	lying in the corner at the very end of the service waiting area, however, was a genesis full brochure with most of the details that the salesman was lacking.	1
	i think hyundai is completely clueless about marketing,                they have spent a pile developing and manufacturing very good cars lately and then they send them out to old-line hack sales groups, and worse yet, don't bring the dealerships up to certain service standards.	1
	when you buy a car, you are buying a total experience.	1
	i enjoy my azera, and fortunately for me, i have had zero defects and problems for my two years.	1
	i bought my car off lease at the option price, since the re-sale has held up so well and also know that my car is 'perfect.'	1
	however, i can assure you that i will not buy another hyundai, because i have been lucky to have a car without problems.	1
	if that had not been the case, i am sure it would have been a series of horrors to get my problems solved given the poor training and lack of coordination between dealer and manufacturer.	1
	i would rather spend the extra $6-$10k to go from a genesis to an infiniti m45 or somesuch and know that over a 6 or 7 year ownership, that extra money buys me a relationship with a dealer network and manufacturer that are dedicated to total customer satisfaction and will save me a pile of aggravation.	1
	someday hyundai just might get their act together, but right now....excellent products, but every other part of the purchase/ownership relationship is a total crapshoot.	1
	i will keep my azera and enjoy it and feel it was a good buy, but also realize i have been lucky!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1501#msg1501re: hope the dealers are better [frazee]        i, also, bought my azera at the end of the lease.	1
	i've had it for 27 months and it's in excellent condition and only has 18,000 miles.	1
	i'm keeping my eye on the genesis and will wait until there are many reviews, crash test results, buyer experiences, etc.	1
	even though i had a really awful experience leasing my azera, i did finally find a good dealership which knew what they were doing.	1
	i'm not dismissing buying a genesis, but after the laughably bad experiences at hyundai dealerships, i am going be quite cautious before buying another hyundai automobile.	1
	if things haven't changed from two years ago, i find it rather ridiculous that such inept dealerships would try to sell what they consider to be 'up-scale' automobiles.	1
	the difference between, say, acura and hyundai is like the difference between nordstrom and wal-mart.	1
	could a wal-mart really sell high-end clothing and housewares with their current atmosphere and employees?	1
	doubt it, yet, hyundai is trying to do that with the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1502#msg1502genesis gene pool        many potential genesis purchasers will no doubt be current azera owners.	1
	i agree with the previous comments from frazee and ricwhite.	1
	in my case i leased an '07 azera in oct '06 from a stand alone hyundai dealer.	1
	the lease experience was flawless, but service related issues such as programming locks after purchase was a joke.	1
	i was charged, then reimbursed after receiving a welcome mailer from hyundai fountain valley.	1
	sadly, the original dealer went belly up shortly after.	1
	now hyundai is the secondary product line in the closest dealer to my home and i dread making a service appointment as i know more about azera than they do.	1
	my lease expires in april '09.	1
	maybe by then genesis will have indeed been launched and available for sale / lease.	1
	but as long as korea is satisfied with mediocrity with their local dealers i'll probably purchase this otherwise satisfying vehicle and turn over service responsibility to my wife.	1
	i doubt the fast, cheap and out the door approach will fly with genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1503#msg1503re: hope the dealers are better [ricwhite]        ric...you had said ' the difference between, say, acura and hyundai is like the difference between nordstrom and wal-mart.'	1
	actually wal-mart is a very well-run and competent operation that is somewhat consumer-friendly.	1
	i think the difference between infiniti/acura and hyundai dealers are somewhat more akin to the difference between .99 cent stores and nordstroms.                )	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1504#msg1504will wait for 3rd year        the old adage of waiting for the 3rd year of a new car model is still true based on my experience with a 2007 azera.	1
	this is even more true with the genesis as it contains so many new components.	1
	while i like my azera and its impressive list of luxury features, the suspension isn't as good as it should be.	1
	my dealer's service dept.	1
	has been very cooperative and super on pricing.	1
	however, the lack of knowledge extends through the whole dealership.	1
	i also believe they use the hyundai store to train employees for the gm and nissan stores they also own.	1
	maybe by 2011, the genesis will have proven itself to the professionals, in long term testing and be reasonably priced.       	1

	we've already seen pics of the car itself.	1
	pretty much everyone is in agreement that the car looks nice (personally, i think it looks better than nice, but that's just me).	1
	i stopped by the dealer i bought my azera from and picked up a brochure on the genesis.	1
	the manager told me that he ordered two genesis sedans.	1
	one will be the v-6 and the other will be a fully loaded v-8 model.	1
	interesting point, all the speculation concerning the 3 power plants that hyundai would be offering and the brochure only lists two, the 3.8 v-6 and the 4.6 v-8.	1
	i would be led to believe that the 3.3 v-6 would only be available in other markets overseas like they did with the azera (at first).	1
	so concerning the north american market...there will only be 2 engines offered (the way it should be).	1
	i can't wait for the phone call for me to go get my test drive!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1508#msg1508re: suprised no one has responded to those photos [allmet33]        whats to be said??	1
	pretty simple - read my question.	1
	a brochure is as good as seeing a car on the web.	1
	seeing it in person is much more rewarding, therefore i want to know where the pics were taken.	1
	if its local (which it looks to be based on the license plates (all california) on the surrounding vehicles), i want to know.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1509#msg1509re: suprised no one has responded to those photos [kylechoffman]        first of all, your posting was titled, 'surprised no one has responded to those photos'  considering you see all the ca plates on the surrounding cars, you've got part of the where question already answered.	1
	there are a few of us that ventured down to our local auto shows and saw the car in person.	1
	i would agree with you...seeing it in person is much more rewarding.	1
	considering hyundai's headquartered in fountain valley, ca, i would gather those pics were taken somewhere close to that vicinity as i'm sure they would have one of the first ones to hit the roads.	1
	there are dealers that have a stripped down version for their techs to get familiar with (not all of them though).	1
	there was a posting about someone seeing a genesis here in the dc area (fredericksburg, va to be exact).	1
	p.s.	1
	a brochure is a little better than just a pic on the web, that means it's that much closer to being in the showrooms.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1510#msg1510re: suprised no one has responded to those photos [allmet33]        wasnt aware hq was in fv.	1
	autoshow's arent always production models so hence seeing a car on the road close to release is a lot closer to reality.	1
	maybe i will see one in huntington this weekend or newport since the dw and i will be up at the hyatt for the weekend.	1
	to me the web and a paper brochure are the same - advertising.	1
	once web 3.0 happens, maybe paper brochures will be a thing of the past and you can have a true 3d interaction with an object.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1511#msg1511re: suprised no one has responded to those photos [kylechoffman]        the car in the photos looks exactly like the one that was at the greater twin cities auto show in march--same color even!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1512#msg1512re: suprised no one has responded to those photos [kylechoffman]        yeah...their u.s. based hq is in fountain valley.	1
	the only difference between the the car that was being shown at the auto shows and the 'production' model is the one at the auto show was the korean version, not the u.s. version.	1
	considering the car is supposed to make its showroom debut in june (which is around the corner), you could very well see one or two if you're looking out for them.	1
	i do know what you mean about seeing it on the web, when i saw the azera on the web, it didn't really grab my attention, but seeing it in person gave me a whole new perception.	1
	the genesis...well, that one has grabbed my attention in picture form and it didn't disappoint when i saw it.	1
	the only disappointment i had was the fact i couldn't sit in the car and was even more disappointed when other people posted that they did get to sit in the car.	1

	i owned a vw passat v6 before the azera and they both had similar epa ratings.	1
	however, with the passat, i was able to get around 20 city.	1
	the azera gets around 15 city -- with the same routes as i had with the passat.	1
	that's a 25% reduction in gas mileage over the passat.	1
	it's also significantly below the epa estimate.	1
	with the passat, i actually got higher than the epa estimate.	1
	and with 'stop and go' heavy traffic driving, the azera mileage drops to 12-13 mpg.	1
	all i'm saying is that i was expecting a little better and i hope the v8 genesis has improved mileage efficiency.	1
	if it doesn't, then i would expect about 13 city and 25 highway.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1532#msg1532genesis preview review        i read two previews from motortrend and automobile magazine, (if that is what they can be called) about the soon to be released hyundai genesis and to be honest, both did very little to quench my curiosity about the ride and handling of the genesis sedan.	1
	perhaps, this was intentional?	1
	so why bother publishing these bare bone previews?	1
	i suspect because it may have something to do with the pent up demand for specific details on genesis.	1
	this has helped hyundai create a well orchestrated pre-market dribble, dribble, release of non-specific, yet some what specific details, regarding the genesis, for which it has masterfully hyped quite successfully, as the desire for even more information about this u.s. spec korean luxury sedan persist.	1
	this impression is made even more self evident because both mt and automobile, having realized this, have promised full blown reviews which are already scheduled for their upcoming august issues.	1
	this impressed upon me how important the automotive media considers genesis.	1
	neither preview commented on how well they perceived the genesis would compare against the new pontiac g8, current chrysler 300, new maxima or lexus es350, cars likely to be its main competitive rivals.	1
	however, there were some useful insights that i garnered from these early previews.	1
	namely, the genesis can hold its own in terms of delivering on the claim of luxury amenities from the lexus like ride, and the suspension, to the overall fit and finish one equates with a luxury sedan.	1
	it also seems to be on par with overall ride and comfort.	1
	i found it amusing that one of the more curious comments came from the automobile mag reviewer who quibbled dubiously about whether the lexicon sound system could match or equal the lexus mark levinsons by boasting, 'an optional 500-watt lexicon stereo might not be the equal of the mark levinson's system offered by lexus, but it will meet the expectations of all but the pickiest audiophiles, and there's easy access to the equalizer function.'	1
	dont forget the operative word here is might which was most likely provoked by this reviewers 'wow' realization that i cant believe this is a hyundai deer-in-headlight remark.	1
	as the reviews begin to trickle in on genesis, i expect to read more of this sort of over-bitten hyperbole from established mainstream media types who have yet to get past their jaded memories of hyundais from the 80s and 90s.	1
	perhaps the genesis will force them to get up to speed on the major transformations that have re-shaped hyundai both on an engineering and technological scale.	1
	nothing more to think about.	1
	yes, imagine hyundai.                        	1

	hyundai will offer the genesis in a variety of powertrains choices including a 3.3l v6 that produces 268 horsepower and a 3.8l v6 that produces 290 horsepower and a peak torque of 264 lb-ft. the range topper tau 4.6l v8 produces 375 horsepower giving the genesis the ability to do 0-60 in less than six seconds.	1

	(at least as an option)                                the genesis rides on all-season 235/50r18 or 225/55r17 series tires-i would like to see optional 245/45r18 summer performance tires on both the 6 and the 8 cylinder version.	1
	also what about more wheel choices?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1563#msg1563re: another price comparo [backy]        ok... i am an avalon owner so this may sound a little biased.	1
	however, 1st the small power difference will probably have little to no effect on acceleration (due to the slightly increased weight of the gen)                                2: resale, we have no idea what the resale of the genesis will be like... but if its anything like the current line up of hyundai it could be pretty bad.	1
	3:  the avalon is the class leader in terms of ride, fe,  reliability.	1
	genesis is completely new, so its a little difficult to compare except on paper.	1
	4:  what does the base model genesis have that the av limited doesn't?	1
	does the base v6 come with hids, upgraded stereo, rainsensing wipers, memory seats, sunshade?	1
	all options that will bring the price = to or above the avalon.	1
	i am all for the genesis being a great vehicle.	1
	however, i want to see a full review and some real world fe #s.  i think its still a little too early to really compare it to anything.	1
	just the 'first drives' confirm that it will not be a sports car by any means.	1
	my current avalon lease goes back in less than a year, so i will be car shopping soon enough.	1
	the genesis may be on my list, but, for now there are too many ?s.	1
	already, i am surprised that hyundai is going to start this car at 33k.	1
	that will scare many right away.	1
	i tell this story all the time but when i was looking at the azera i can't tell you the amount of people that said 30k for a hyundai?	1
	are you nuts?....	1
	2 years later i don't think the world is ready for a 40k hyundai.	1
	mark my words, there will be rebates, special financing/leases within a year if they want to get the volume to 30/40k units a year.	1
	if they are happy with 15/20k on a 'niche' vehicle than maybe not.	1
	only time will tell.	1
	p.s.	1
	in times of $4 gas this isn't the best time to introduce a 375hp v8 car, even if the economy #s look good for a sedan of this size and power.	1
	if gas keeps going up the only things selling at msrp may be hybrids and 4cyls (but that is a different discussion)       	1

	but if the genesis is an even nicer riding car than either of these two vehicles, then the choice is simple.	1

	heck, a base dts with a good deal of options is $44.6k and with the current $3k incentive trumps the gen. if you compare that with the v-6 gen, the caddy looks real good!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1577#msg1577re: another price comparo [tjc78]        1.  the azera limited is the car most comparable to the avalon limited.	1
	i looked at the avalon ltd. with esc, sunroof, upgraded stereo, et.al., but it had less than the azera and cost $10,000 more bottom line.	1
	2.  genesis is aimed at lexus, bmw, acura and infiniti markets.	1
	will have a hard time breaking in as the 'badge prestige' is what many people pay for in these makes.	1
	3.  i will look at the genesis, but very carefully and only after it has been on the road for a couple of years.	1
	4.  one of hyundai's major selling points is the extremely well equipped cars it offers for a very low price and with an outstanding warranty.	1
	my azera is much better equipped than a 2008 acura rl i recently drove.	1
	5.  based on what i have read, hyundai does not intend for this to be a sports car.       	1

	will have a hard time breaking in as the 'badge prestige' is what many people pay for in these makes.	1
	yes... that is why it will most likely sell to avalon/azera/lucerne/town car drivers and not bmw 5 and lexus gs drivers.	1
	its just the way its going to be.	1
	i don't see it any other way.	1
	i am in no way bashing hyundai.	1
	the azera is a hell of a car that gives the avalon a run for its money.	1
	do i prefer the avalon?	1
	yes, but mainly because of the looks and slightly better handling and interior.	1
	as i have said before the genesis will be on my short list of cars in march/april of '09.	1
	the v6 with the premium package looks pretty good.	1
	however, if this vehicle is going at msrp or above i will certainly look elsewhere.	1
	there are too many other alternatives at 35k+ (such as the new '09 maxima)       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1579#msg1579pricing        obviously the pricing is higher than a lot of us first forecasted, i'd blame mostly on the weak dollars.	1
	that said, the uptick will allow the azera some room to roam.	1
	hyundai certainly isn't the only automaker being affected.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1580#msg1580re: more features please... [technishawn]        let me start by saying if you feel the need to say 'not looking for a fight' it usually means that you are.	1
	its like saying 'no offense' right before you say something you know will be offensive.	1
	that being said, i will take the bait and point out a few things that you might have overlooked when typing out your mini-rant.	1
	first of all, how do you know it won't have these features?	1
	just because you haven't seen them published does not mean they are absent.	1
	i'd be surprised if it did not have fold-down side mirrors or an 8-way power passenger seat (at least as part of an option package).	1
	otherwise, what cars in the  $30-40k price range have power folding side mirrors or reclining rear seats.	1
	as far as your other features: power pedals, remote start, remote power windows, these are all gimmicks that are rarely, if ever, used by the majority of people.	1
	besides do any lexus, infiniti, bmw or mercedes cars have these features-no, because they are gimmicks?	1
	also, not everyone likes the folding rear seats because that limits the amount of sound insulation you can use back there and makes the car noisier.	1
	in fact, most luxury cars don't have folding rear seats for this very reason.	1
	if you don't like the car, fine, you don't have to.	1
	but stop making stuff up just to start an argument on a message board.	1
	is your life that empty that you can't find any excitement in the real world?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1581#msg1581sports car?	1
	you know the one bizarre thing.	1
	most sedans aren't sports sedans with only a few big exceptions.	1
	everyone looking for that sporty and luxury vehicle should be staring directly at the genesis coupe.	1
	the genesis itself is obviously more in the inbetween arena where most standard mercedes-benz models would live.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1582#msg1582features?	1
	if i read the english spoken fountain valley propaganda correctly, my '07 azera has a couple of features the 'new' genesis rwd 3.8 does not.	1
	(with all option packages)                                (granted, genesis has features my azera does not).	1
	1.  adjustable pedals                2.  rear sun shade                                i may have overlooked something, and i am sure it will be brought to my attention.	1
	fast forward a year from today.	1
	genesis rebates will equal or exceed azera rebates.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1583#msg1583re: features?	1
	[dborth]        well, you forgot to mention the azera has fwd, which is not available on the genesis.	1
	a power rear sunshade is listed in the premium package for the v6.	1
	power pedals are mentioned on the features list, but shown as not available.	1
	that leads me to believe they are available on the genesis                 someplace                .	1
	just not the u.s.  yet?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1584#msg1584re: more features please... [docrw]        i said i was not looking for a fight because i thought if i posted any criticism that someone would get their feelings hurt and lash out...omg.	1
	this is why i do not post unless i feel it is something important to me.	1
	i really enjoy power features in my cars.	1
	my wife is very short and uses the power pedals and our driveway is butted up with our neighbors so i have to get close to his truck and i often use my power folding mirrors...... why am i explaining this                i am really sorry if i offended anyone i was just disappointed and made the mistake of voicing it on this forrum...lesson learned...again.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1585#msg1585re: detailed pricing / packages for genesis [viking967]        what i find interesting is that there is only a $2,000 price difference between a loaded v6 and a loaded v8.	1
	in the bmw/infiniti/lexus world a v8 adds at least $5,000 to the price.	1
	i think there will be many more buyers opting for the v8 at that price difference and they will be very hard to get.	1
	this is based on what i have read saying that the majority of genesis produced will be v6 (like the majority of bmw/lexus/infiniti).	1
	dealers will probably add an extra markup to the v8 and discount the v6 more aggressively.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1586#msg1586re: detailed pricing / packages for genesis [tom17]         dealers will probably add an extra markup to the v8                                in the days of $4 and $5 gas?	1
	the performance difference of the v8 compared to the v6 doesn't seem to be all that great to take the fe hit.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1587#msg1587new home        we've moved to the 'permanent' location on the sedans board.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1588#msg1588re: more features please... [technishawn]        you didn't offend me.	1
	i was just pointing out that the features whose absence you were lamenting were either aimed at a small demographic, or generally not found in cars in this price range.	1
	you just so happen to be someone who wants those features.	1
	as far as the power pedal feature goes, if the genesis has a power tilt and telescope steering wheel and power seats, that should make the need for power pedals moot.	1
	power pedals are usually only offered in cars that don't have the power steering wheel.	1
	as far as the mirrors go, you can always fold them by hand.	1
	the only cars i have ever had with power-folding mirrors have been luxury cars or suvs costing upwards of $50k.	1
	i'm sure if hyundai thought people would pay that much for the genesis they would have included that feature and probably a few more.	1
	i guess what im saying is that if those are the only faults you can find with this car even you must admit that its a pretty strong offering.	1
	if you can find a car with all the features of the genesis plus those you mentioned in the same price range, congratulations and please tell us about it.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1592#msg1592nice car        hey guys!	1
	i've been a member of edmunds for a while but this is one of my first posts.	1
	i usually just read the posts and don't comment, but i am really excited about the genesis.	1
	its seems like a heck of a car for the price.	1
	we're talking a 5-series, infiniti m type of car for 10 grand less.	1
	thats impressive.	1
	-but-                                i still believe that a lot of people are going to have sticker shock when they see the price of a loaded genesis.	1
	$40,000 for a fully equipped v6 model?	1
	ouch.	1
	and $33,000 just to get into one?	1
	if you look at the big picture, the genesis is a huge bargain, but i just don't see too many people paying that much for this car.	1
	then again, i could be completely wrong.	1
	personally, i'm waiting until 2011 to find a low-mileage '09 genesis.	1
	if its like other hyundais, i'll be getting a steal.	1
	and i'll still have the 5 yr/60,000 mile powertrain warranty.	1
	i can't wait...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1593#msg1593re: nice car [jason25]        i agree with jason 25 a gs or 5 series would cost 10,000 more with standard equipment, the basic 5 series does not even have leather seating surfaces as standard equipment.	1
	i'm gonna wait until 2012 for a 2009  genesis v8 or a 2010 v6 fully loaded with a cpo warranty.	1
	i only drive two times a week so gas prices are not issue for me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1594#msg1594genesis info        i was discussing the genesis with the general manager at one of the local hyundai dealers this week.	1
	he told me that the cars that are going to be in the initial launch of this model are already in portland, oregon and they will start distributing them to the dealers next week-so i would guess that portland and that area would see them first.	1
	he told me what he thought the pricing would be-pretty much what you'll find in this discussion thread-lots of links here if you want to research.	1
	looks like a great car that i am anxious to drive.	1
	i currently drive a 2002 avalon xls that is awesome-hard to follow up the ride and reliability of the toyota flagship vehicle but i am hoping.	1
	i admit that i'm a little disturbed at the price of the vehicles after the options-40k for the 3.8 v-6 and 42k for the 4.6 v-8.	1
	a 3.5 limited avalon is right at 40k-so we will see what the final window sticker looks like for the genesis.	1
	i've been promised a test drive as soon as the genesis sedans get here-i was told in the next two weeks for sure.	1
	the dealers don't have any pricing details but they are all going to meetings in the next week to figure this out so they can speak intelligently to the public about this new product.	1
	let's hope this is as good as it looks-i'm pumped........the manager told me that hyundai believes that those customers who love the genesis but can't quite afford one will pay a little  less to get the 2009 azera which has had suspension and other tweaks done to it.	1
	hope this info is useful........       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1595#msg1595re: test preview [circlew]        thanks for the link: reads like an objective, expert review.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1596#msg1596re: more features please... [technishawn]        you stated what features you found the genesis wanting, i expressed my opinion about those features.	1
	is it not permissible to disagree with you.	1
	i was neither rude nor uncivil.	1
	if you don't want your opinions to be commented on then ignore the comments.	1
	if you don't agree with what i wrote then tell me why.	1
	i won't get upset, i promise.	1
	if you didn't care about other people's perceptions you would not have posted your thoughts in the first place.	1
	obviously, you were expected a chorus of huzzahs.	1
	i'm sorry your post was not universally adored but this is a forum based on give and take and sharing opinions.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1600#msg1600confused...        from the looks to the features and the powertrain, everything sounds good for the genesis.	1
	my only question is what will this do with the hyundai brand image?	1
	from what i know it will be a hyundai, but i see hyundai does feel somewhat pressed in that area, as there is no 'h' on the grille.	1
	i see a pattern-from the azera to the veracruz to this- so maybe hyundai wants to go upmarket?	1
	this might be smart as hyundai and kia are virtually on the same level (hyundai's cars are a little nicer).	1
	but it would take forever for hyundai to truely reinvent its image without losing a ton of market share.	1
	after over 20 years, acura still isn't on mercedes benz's level (but lexus almost is).	1
	it's said that the competitors are the avalon and the 300, but hyundai wouldn't have spent so much time and money adding luxury features like the latest tech toys, rwd, a v8 and sport tuned suspension just to keep up with those.	1
	they want this to be a car that competes with the best.	1
	and i think this is a better effort than acura has given in the last 10 years.	1
	i'm not sure how this will all play out, but since hyundai has made such a strong effort, i hope it goes well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1601#msg1601re: confused... [albook]        albook, even though there is no 'h' on the grille, there is still one on the trunk...either way, it's still a hyundai.	1
	concerning acura...it seems they've never been able to turn the corner.	1
	they produce very nice cars, but can't quite seem to reach that level of lexus or infiniti.	1
	i don't know what you've read in regards to what the genesis will be competing against.	1
	the azera already competes with the avalon, maxima, 300 and the like.	1
	the genesis is going after bigger fish such as the infiniti m, lexus g and if you were to say 300, it would have to be the 300c, but in either form (v-8 or v-6) the 300 can't compete with the genesis.	1
	hyundai is indeed doing one thing..reforming the mold of what a car company should be.	1
	if you step back and take a look, the only thing missing from the hyundai line-up is a pick-up truck.	1
	they've covered everything from sub-compact economy all the way up to large sedan luxury.	1
	it takes toyota 3 companies to achieve this goal and nissan has to do it with 2.  hyundai is showing you can indeed get everything from a single company (at this point).	1
	however, this is merely my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1602#msg1602re: confused... [allmet33]         the only thing missing from the hyundai line-up is a pick-up truck                                they were planning a truck based on the next-gen kia sorrento, but it was recently cancelled.	1
	the reason given was the increase in fuel prices.	1
	imagine that!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1603#msg1603re: confused... [tenpin288]        well...i know that kia had a concept pick up a while back called the mojave, but nothing ever came of it.	1
	there is talk of hyundai using a diesel engine in the veracruz, which might spread to the entourage as well.	1
	if that is the case, the pick up could share that same engine and be a viable option.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1604#msg1604re: confused... [allmet33]        found the article about it...                                 no hyundai pickup        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1605#msg1605re: confused... [allmet33]        already offered in its home market, the 3.0l v6 s-diesel engine is still on target for us release, if i recall correctly.       	1

	the azera already competes with the avalon, maxima, 300 and the like.	1
	the genesis is going after bigger fish such as the infiniti m, lexus g and if you were to say 300, it would have to be the 300c                                no.	1
	i know that hyundai benchmarked the likes of the m and gs and 5 series, but when the media talks about the genesis' competition, they clearly list the avalon and maxima, and the 300(c) and g8(yeah, i'm not sure about that one either).	1
	so i understand the genesis is well equipped to take on contenders on the more prestigous end of the spectrum, realistically it doesn't compete directly with these cars because of where the brand sits in terms of prestige.	1
	and hyundai just made it to toyota.	1
	as for hyundai having all everything from economy to luxury, that's the reason the genesis can't truely be a real luxury sedan on par with mercedes (okay, maybe lexus; nothing is on par with mb or bmw).	1
	so maybe hyundai should move upmarket.	1
	and why not?	1
	they have kia, so that can move upto where hyundai is now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1607#msg1607re: nice car [flc2006]         the basic 5 series does not even have leather seating surfaces as standard equipment.	1
	what?!	1
	i'll have to see some sources that back that up.	1
	i don't think anything north of the 3 series even offers cloth seating.	1
	i think hyundai would be wise not to let the price of of the genesis go north of 45g.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1608#msg1608re: confused... [albook]        albook you are definitely correct about the target market competitors for genesis, here is an exact quote from john krafcik, hyundai's vp of product development and strategic planning,                 while genesis will compete for customers with cars like chrysler 300 and pontiac g8, our engineering benchmarks were mercedes e-class, bmw 5 series, infiniti m and lexus gs,                krafcik noted.	1
	clearly, although genesis brings luxury aspirations to play, hyundai is being quite realistic in understanding its market position.	1
	all indicators are that hyundai's brand will benefit from a consumer perception lift.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1619#msg1619re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [jeffreid]        not to be offensive, but since you do work for a hyundai dealer, as even you yourself seem to admit, you may be a bit biased.	1
	everyone has their own oppinions.	1
	this is that of motortrends- the top auto-media source in the country (statistically speaking).	1
	i myself think that though fvery respectable cars, hyundai isn't quite at the level of honda, toyota or even chevrolet in some cases (well, mainly, the malibu).	1
	all the same, this sounds (and looks) like a great car, and i hope hyundai has great success with it.	1
	i know they will if they keep that price under 45g.	1
	and the respect will come- soon if the genesis has anything to say about it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1620#msg1620re: nice car [sg2k]         www.bmwusa.com has it.	1

	leather is $1450 option.	1
	ok- that makes since.	1
	because there is no way in- well theres no way i'd pay that much for a bmw and get cloth.	1
	i should have paid more attention to that when i bought mine.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1621#msg1621re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [albook]        no offense take.	1
	sure, there is some bias toward the product.	1
	that is why i put the notice at the top of the post from the beginning.	1
	my point was simply that they seemed to be selling the product short not on its merit, but on its origin.	1
	said another way, they are being auto racists.	1
	'this car is second rate b/c its not from japan or germany' stuff.	1
	all i was saying is that i would like to see them be objective regardless of brand.	1
	if the car sucks, just say so.	1
	if the car is solid, say that as well.	1
	i am going to reserve saying anything until i sit in the vehicle and drive it myself.	1
	i have been with hyundai close to ten years and have seen them bring good ideas to market with less than impressive follow-through before.	1
	with that being said, i do think that i am generally objective, even if i am in the auto business.	1
	as to hyundai being on par with the brands that you mentioned, i think that it is a model by model issue.	1
	i think if you drive the 2009 sonata back to back with the camry and accord you will find the sonata to hold its own with the other two.	1
	also, the elantra is a very solid competitor to the corolla and civic.	1
	if you are speaking of brand equity in general though, you are right, the honda and toyota names obviously carry the heavy weight.	1
	that whole issue really hits at the heart of what i was trying to say.	1
	a car is a means of transportation.	1
	that does not mean that you can't enjoy yourself while you are getting there though.	1
	if a person is doing a professional review of a product, then they should give it a fair shake on its own merit.	1
	also, the next time you go car shopping, stop by your local dealer and try out hyundai's competitive set.	1
	kick the tires and really see what the car is made of, maybe you'll be impressed and maybe you won't.	1
	by the way, the hard loaded genesis will top out at $42k.	1
	thanks for the reply.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1622#msg1622re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [rjlaero]        toyota doesn't have a plant in tennessee.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1623#msg1623re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [jeffreid]        well said there.	1
	hyundai's improvements in recent years, especially, have been well-charted.	1
	take any of its product fleet, and you'd be supremely ignorant to say they are not up to par with the rest of the class; actually, some even better, in my opinion.	1
	i feel the issue continues to lie along the lines of stigma and perception, two things unfortuantely have been slow to overcome by (similar history on the japanese makers not along ago).	1
	hopefully, the continued output of quality products, such as the santa fe, azera, veracruz; and favorable presses, such as recent cr praises on the elantra, or the 09 sonata, will shift the trend and reverse the forgettable excel days.	1
	the soon-arrival of the hyundai genesis, and later genesis coupe, if nothing else, will help to place a greater emphasis on the brand.	1
	further, the intangibles created from the genesis line should benefit across the brand and its products.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1624#msg1624re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [rjlaero]         what's the differnece in toyota's being made [sic] tennesse and a hyundai in alabama?	1

	a few thousand dollars and a longer warranty?	1
	that is the most humorous and well said response i've read in quite some time.	1
	i also agree that the perception is the key hold-back.	1
	i believe this will change quite significantly with the arrival of genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1626#msg1626re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [carbunt]        yes, it will.	1
	but i think there's other recent events that are changing perceptions of hyundai, e.g.	1
	cr naming the elantra se and santa fe their 'top picks' in their respective classes, and positive buzz on models like the veracruz (e.g.	1
	mt's comparo in which the veracruz topped lexus) and the 2009 sonata.	1
	the fact is, many more people will be looking for economical sedans like the accent, elantra and sonata in the near future than luxury sedans like the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1627#msg1627i found the genesis i saw a few weeks ago!!!	1
	i was on my way to an appointment for costco today, in fredericksburg, when i spotted it again parked in front of some office buildings.	1
	after a bit of poking around i found the driver of the car and he put the keys in my hands and said explore all you want, just dont drive the car!	1
	!!	1
	this is one sweet car.	1
	he was one of the lucky few who got to 'live' with one of the prototype cars from hyundai.	1
	he is the only one between nj and ga. too bad he has to give it back.	1
	its a shame they send those cars to the crusher when they're done.	1
	i would gladly pay the tariffs for the vehicle.	1
	this particular iteration had the adaptive cruise control( coming later in '09) as well as some other features he said wouldn't be on the ones soon to be on sale.	1
	he was very pleased with the car and he currently owns an azera.	1
	i was very impressed with the car inside and out!	1
	its a tad bigger inside than the azera and had the heated and cooled seats.	1
	the only thing i didn't care for and think is odd is that only the drivers seat is cooled.	1
	kinda half-u-know-whated i think but oh well.	1
	i loved the multi-media controller.	1
	i found it very easy to use.	1
	i think i may hold off a bit buying the car though cause i would like to have the car with some of the features that they wont include on this first go around.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1628#msg1628re: i found the genesis i saw a few weeks ago!!!	1
	[black_pearl]        the multi media knob is in the tech package.	1
	quite expensive but you do get a lot though.	1
	3.8l tech package includes the premium plus package which gives you those 18' wheels.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1630#msg1630re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [carbunt]        perception plays a big part in the success or lack thereof.	1
	i bought my '02 sonata with heavy skepticism because i had just gotten out of a '96 camry.	1
	they wanted $23k for the '02 camry optioned out like i wanted and a buddy of mine mentioned looking at the newly reshaped sonata.	1
	i went, test drove it and found out that it felt very much like my previous camry on the road.	1
	got back to the dealer and found out that it would only cost me just under $17k optioned out similarly like the camry.	1
	okay, $6k was enough to sway me (not to mention the warranty).	1
	4 years and 105k miles later, i can say that the sonata made me forget about my '96 camry and not regret going with the '02 camry.	1
	i had such a good experience with it, that i traded it in for the '06 azera i have now.	1
	the funny thing is that the perception is held by folks that have never even set foot in a hyundai showroom, much less parked their butts in the seat of a hyundai car.	1
	anyone that questions me about my selection, i simply tell them to go test drive one and see for themselves.	1
	hyundai has come a long way and they are headed in the right direction.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1631#msg1631re: i found the genesis i saw a few weeks ago!!!	1
	[rv65]        the tech package is a $4000 total option on both the v6 and the v8.	1
	with all considered though, it seems like a pretty good deal as it includes the navigation system, 30gig hard drive, moonroof, 7.1 soundsystem, leather wrapped dash, backup camera, and the 18' wheels on the v6 model.	1
	the thing is though, you only drop $1000 to go down to the package that brings the 18' wheels without the tech pkg.	1
	how many of these cars are you going to see with the 17's?	1
	most people are going to want the bigger wheels and then for only $1000 more, hey why not add nav, the better sound system, etc.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1632#msg1632re: i found the genesis i saw a few weeks ago!!!	1
	[jeffreid]        the hard drive is actually 40 gb.	1
	this navigation system is the best that hyundai has ever offered.	1
	includes a widescreen vga screen compared to a non vga screen.	1
	in korea there is an onstar like telematics system called mozen and it's super awesome.	1
	just a correction on the navigation system.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1633#msg1633re: i found the genesis i saw a few weeks ago!!!	1
	[bigelm]        the gentleman didn't say but i know i have seen mention of paddle shifters which i prefer rather than the current gated shifter set up.	1
	i am certain they have other toys that are in the kdm spec car that won't make it here at first similar to the approach taken with the azera.	1
	but that's fine.	1

	said another way, they are being auto racists.	1
	'this car is second rate b/c its not from japan or germany' stuff.	1
	well, that's probably because we still aren't completely used to seeing such quality cars from hyundai.	1
	i think it will take another 3-5 years for hyundai to truely break the stereotype.	1
	the genesis will be a huge part od that.	1
	and when that happens, hyundai will finally ge the respect it deserves.	1
	as to hyundai being on par with the brands that you mentioned, i think that it is a model by model issue.	1
	true, but, in my experience with sonata vs camry/accord/even malibu (a friend cross-shopped the four) idefinitely say the sonata comes in fourth in terms of driving and comfort quality.	1
	but a lot of that is because all three of these are newer.	1
	when the sonata is redesigned, it will compete sqaurely.	1
	and i have to agree with mt that the current elantra benchmarked the last-gen. civic.	1
	i think the elantra is miles away from the new civic.	1
	but i'd say the veracruz is eqaul to or better than the highlander, the genesis obviously puts the avalon to shame.	1
	the genesis tops out at 42k?	1
	is that with a v8?	1
	i've read it starts at 45k with a v8.	1
	hope thats not true.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1636#msg1636re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [albook]        yes, $42k will be msrp on  the v8 with the tech package.	1
	the base v8 will be $38k and will bring the roof, leather wrapped dash, and the 18' wheels.	1
	as far as the model comparos go, i think we are pretty much in agreement.	1
	i was referring to the 2009 sonata, not to the 2006-2008. with the interior and engine upgrades it is much more competitive.	1
	and i'm glad you said genesis vs. avalon b/c i think that the avalon spanks the azera out of the park!!!	1
	thanks for the reply.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1637#msg1637re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [albook]        msrp - v6 starts at 33k, and v8 at 38k, with freight included.	1
	a loaded genesis tops out at 42k.	1
	aside from all of the fancy features, technologies, and attractive pricing/warranty, the fuel economy was a lot higher than my expectation                                a little ot, but i don't agree with the assessment the civic is                 miles                ahead of the elantra.	1
	while i don't have a lot of driving time in either, i have driven both back to back, and i've found both to be excellent compact/medium size cars (note elantra is rated a class above civic in terms of interior space); in other words, they both do their jobs well, practical, delivery more than respectable mpg, and for most, relatively inexpensive to own.	1
	both excel in certain areas but do have their shortfalls.	1
	by the way, the civic not new; the elantra is actually newer in terms of release dates        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1638#msg1638re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [jeffreid]        'avalon spanks the azera out of the park!!!'	1

	come on now...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1639#msg1639re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [joe97]        just my opinion.......                                as a person that is part of a hyundai dealer i know it may sound funny, but in terms of ride, drive, overall assembly, comfort features, and power vs. real-world fuel economy, i think that the avalon is just a superior vehicle.	1
	and really, i don't think its very close.	1
	again, just my view.	1
	now, when the 2009 azera hits the lot, my opinion might change.	1
	i have been very impressed with the upgrades to the 2009 sonata and if the new azera upgrades mirror that, then i may change my opinion.	1
	and since this is a genesis forum i must say that what i have seen so far makes me smile.	1
	i think that hyundai (for once) got this one right from the start.	1
	i have seen a bad habit in the past of new products being a little 'incomplete'.	1
	i see a little of that with this car (only driver's seat cooled?)	1
	but there isn't much to change, and what little there is seems a pretty easy fix.	1
	one other thing on that note.	1
	for the first time hyundai is having the dealers order exactly what they want on the genesis.	1
	i hope that they are seeing the fact that this car is going to need to be tailored to the customer's desires in terms of feature content and handling/ride.	1
	this also means that if you are patient (read 2-3 months) you can plunk down a deposit and have a genesis made exactly how you would like.	1
	please oh please just don't make me take 2 base model v6's (no roof, no 18' wheels, no leather dash...) to get one v8 when they come out..............       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1640#msg1640re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [jeffreid]        fair enough.	1
	i just thought the 'spank out of the park' was a bit too strong, as the azera can handle its own weight vs. the avalon.	1
	obviously i am not going into details since this is the genesis forum but bottom line, i think most would slot the avalon and the azera at the top of the rankings in the fwd large sedan class, and most deservedly both cars do.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1641#msg1641genesis release date        any idea when the genesis will be available at the dealers here in southern calif?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1642#msg1642re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [jeffreid]         yes, $42k will be msrp on the v8 with the tech package.	1
	the base v8 will be $38k and will bring the roof, leather wrapped dash, and the 18' wheels.	1
	that's great.	1
	sounds good-even to a 5 series owner.	1
	and i'm glad you said genesis vs. avalon b/c i think that the avalon spanks the azera out of the park!!!	1

	honda even stepped out of their comfort zone and gave it style.	1
	it had to grow on me.	1
	but now i love it.	1
	it has character now, and the elantra doesn't, but that's just my oppinion.	1

	not a huge one, though                                to some people the 'avalon advantage' was worth $5,000...but not to me.       	1

	no.	1
	hyundai doesn't want to have to charge less for their vehicles.	1
	they want to - and will eventually be on level with toyota.	1
	but for now, they have to do as you said and offer competitive vehicles for a very competitive price, because they aren't as establishedas toyota, and most don't have the mentality that hyundai and toyota are on the same level.	1
	however, they are getting there, as, if you haven't noticed recently, hyundai's prices aren't as cheap as they used to be.       	1

	i'm tall and have had a diffucult time fitting in sedans as they push for better drag coefficients.	1
	i currently drive an infiniti m45, which is acceptable, but i still brush against the ceiling.	1
	i've seen the measurement for the genesis at 40.4 inches which is very good but if the seat sits high or the adjustment won't go down enough, it may not be good enough.	1
	btw, i visited the dealership in santa fe last week and the sales rep had just been in albuquerque the day before getting training on the new genesis.	1
	i don't know if he actually got to drive it or anything, but he said it was really nice.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1653#msg1653re: genesis update [xtec]        the product mix is going to favor the v6 by a lot, especially now with the surging gas prices.	1
	still, the govt stated fuel ratings on the v8 aren't much of a trade-off from the v6 so we'll defn.	1

	having owned 3 hyundai vehicles in my life (87 excel - over 250k miles, 2002 sonata - 105k miles and current 06 azera - 51k miles).	1
	even when hyundai reaches that 'toyota' level, heir prices may be higher than what they currently are, but still won't be as high as what toyota hits you with.	1
	...if you haven't noticed recently, hyundai's prices aren't as cheap as they used to be.	1

	you don't understand.	1
	years ago, the sonata could be bought for much less than a civic, and i (and i'm not alone on this) wouldn't pay a penny more.	1
	now, the sonata is priced much closer to the accord, and with the bounds hyundai has made, i think the current price is totally worth it.	1
	eventually, when they are on level with toyota, hyundais will be more similarly priced.	1
	so i'd say don't get used to buying hyundais because of the price advantage.	1

	i think hyundai is close to toyota in all respects.	1
	they aren't quite there, but are quickly closing in.	1
	the problem is the stigma.	1
	you disagree, but then say the same thing i just said!	1
	when i mentioned technology, i'm talking about the difference between the likes of hyundai's 3.8 v-6 and toyota's 2gr...as much a fan of hyundai as i am, i'm no dummy to realize that toyota has the superior engine.	1
	does that mean that hyundai's engines are bad...no, not at all.	1
	the years you refer to is when hyundai was making disposable cars.	1
	in terms of pricing, a sonata limited maxes out at just under $28k msrp.	1
	the accord ex-l is at just under $31k msrp.	1
	i think the price advantage will always be there for hyundai because in the other cars...you pay for the extra options you want.	1
	hyundai gives you a long list of standard equipment and throws a couple of packages that give you the remaining couple of options that make the car fully loaded.	1
	not to mention the warranty...some believe it's a gimmick, but i believe it shows a company not being afraid to stand behind their product.	1
	i do agree...the quality has improved and with that, pricing has gone up, but...not as dramatically as pricing on various competitors.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1659#msg1659re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [allmet33]        ok, i'll bite.	1
	what specifically makes hyundai's 3.8l, 290 hp v6 inferior to toyota's v6?	1
	or hyundai's 2.4l, 175 hp i4 compared to toyota's 2.4l unit used in the camry et.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1660#msg1660re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        power vs. fuel efficiency.	1
	maybe the 2nd generation 3.8 will be slightly better than the orginal one.	1
	if the technology were equal, then hyundai products would enjoy the same fe numbers that toyota products get.	1
	it's not that far off that i'm sitting here complaining, but...toyota has long been looked at as the fe king, with honda running with or closely behind.	1
	please, understand...i'm not bashing hyundai in any way, for god's sake...i have an azera that i love very much!	1
	in my opinion, the only thing that keeps it from being rated up there with the avalon is the overall ride (the wallowing).	1
	however, by saving $6000, the wallowing was easily overlooked when i purchased and i don't have a problem with it because i don't drive like a mad man.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1661#msg1661re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [allmet33]         if the technology were equal, then hyundai products would enjoy the same fe numbers that toyota products get.	1
	please, understand...i'm not bashing hyundai in any way, for god's sake...                                no, you're not bashing.	1
	but you're wrong... or just out of date.	1
	some examples:                                toyota 2.4l i4 (camry):  158 hp, 21 mpg city, 31 mpg highway (5at)                hyundai 2.4l i4 (sonata):  175 hp, 22 mpg city, 32 mpg highway (5at)                 hyundai is superior to toyota in power and fuel efficiency.	1
	toyota 3.5l v6 (camry, avalon):  268 hp, 19 mpg city, 28 mpg highway                hyundai 3.8l v6 (genesis):  290 hp, 18 mpg city, 27 mpg highway                 hyundai is superior to toyota in power, but gets 1 mpg less in a much heavier car.	1
	sorry, i don't see a signficant difference in toyota's current engine technology compared to hyundai's, based on how they perform.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1662#msg1662re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        actually my friend...the problem with your info is that toyota's 3.5 2gr is currently used in the is 350 pushing out 306 hp and getting 18/25 mpg.	1
	in those terms...if you take the average fe (add both numbers and divide by 2) and take the hp and divide it by the average fe # you came up with...for the hyundai 3.8...you'll see just over 12 mpg per horsepower.	1
	if you do the same with the 306 hp 3.5...you'll see just over 14 mpg per horsepower.	1
	now tell me...which is superior??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1663#msg1663re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        ok.... i have to bite on this one.	1
	the genesis is brand new and not even on the street yet.	1
	so who knows real world fe yet?	1
	i can tell you the avalon will beat the epa #s fairly easily.	1
	heck even with my heavy foot i manage 21 - 22 with virtually no highway (that moves anyway).	1
	the 2gr is one of the smoothest motors i have ever driven.	1
	(as allmet mentioned) it is also capable of over 300hp with di with very little fe loss.	1
	hyundai's bigger 3.8 (using azera as a judge) is nice but in terms of refinement the 2gr wins.	1
	is the 3.8 in the genesis upgraded in that dept?	1
	since none of us have driven one yet, i guess we will have to wait and see.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1664#msg1664re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [tjc78]        i'll take it one further...the 2.7 v-6 that hyundai used when the sonata was refreshed in 2002 was more like the 4-cyl.	1
	toyota engines.	1
	i mean...there were 4 bangers kicking out just as much power (170 hp) as the 2.7 v-6.	1
	so for them to go from there to the 3.8 in a matter of 4 years...that's a huge leap.	1
	i'm not saying that hyundai hasn't made strides...they have and huge ones at that.	1
	the one point i will agree with you on is the stigma that is still attached to the hyundai brand.	1
	the sad thing is...most folks that have a negative opinion about a hyundai car right now...haven't or won't take the time to go check one out because i think they're afraid they may be forced to change their mind...and in their minds, that would make them look foolish (just....my opinion).	1
	believe me...i was skeptical when bought my '02 sonata.	1
	after my experience with it...i'm a believer and that belief has been further cemented with the experience i've been having with my azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1665#msg1665re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [allmet33]        i think 12 mpg per horsepower is really, really great!	1
	what's that on the genesis--3480 mpg?	1
	so toyota's lexus is350 is about 5% more powerful than the genesis 3.8l, but the genesis gets 8% better fe on the highway.	1
	that looks to me like the genesis has the edge there.	1
	in the city, the lexus has the edge, since the fes are the same even though the lexus has 5% more power.	1
	also the is 350 is 10% more expensive than the genesis 3.8.  so the extra value in terms of power and fe doesn't match the price premium.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1666#msg1666re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        dude...if you go based on that, then it almost evens out, doesn't it?	1
	that is why i took the averages of both city/highway driving and did the math that way.	1
	in which case...the lexus edges the hyundai slightly.	1
	i know you want to win the debate, but currently the 2gr engine made by toyota is one of the best engines out there.	1
	to say the hyundai engines aren't quite up to snuff is not a terrible thing at all...just gives them something to shoot for.	1
	some people feel that paying that extra 10% for the lexus assures that you get what you pay for.	1
	me personally, i'll save the 10% and get a couple tanks of gas and enjoy a really nice night on the town to boot!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1667#msg1667re: genesis update [bigelm]        i guess it would be more like 80 percent v6 and 20 percent v8.	1
	thats from what i have heard.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1668#msg1668re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        like tjc has said, the 2gr will easily beat the epa figures.	1
	my is350 gets 19 mpg in city and around 27 mpg on highway with cruise on at 85 mph.	1
	i have no doubt that at 70 mph the highway fe would be even better.	1
	we'll just have to wait and see if the real world mileage figures for the hyundai 3.8l match up with the epa's.	1
	also, let's not forget that the 2gr-fse achieves 5% more power with 8% less of the displacement.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1669#msg1669re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [louiswei]        if i were lexus, i wouldn't crow too loudly yet about how superior the 2gr is over hyundai's 3.8l mill.	1
	hyundai's engineers have noted there is still a lot of headroom on the 3.8, for example, they have not yet put direct injection on it for the genesis, which the 2gr has to make its 306 horsepower.	1
	it will be interesting to see what happens when the 3.8 gets direct injection.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1670#msg1670re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        since hyundai is aiming at the 5/gs/e with the genesis i see nothing wrong to compare the 2gr-fse and hyundai 3.8l straight up.	1
	unless you are suggesting that we should assign some kind of handy cap to hyundai... but wouldn't that go against your claim of hyundai and toyota are on par now in engine technology?	1
	there is something you have to understand and that's the current 2gr-fse is toyota's first iteration (the genesis 3.8l is hyundai's second, if not third) and that engine is very under-tuned.	1
	my source in lexus tells me that with a bit of more aggressive tuning that it can put out 350hp easily (without increasing the displacement!!).	1
	by the way, when would the 3.8 get direct injection?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1671#msg1671re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [allmet33]        ok...                 dude                , let's take the averages of the epa numbers... but let's do it the way the epa does, not the way you would like to do it so the lexus 'wins.'	1
	and they don't use a straight average.	1
	for the is 350, the epa composite fe is 20 mpg.	1
	for the genesis, the epa composite fe is not yet published at fueleconomy.gov, but a car that has the same city/hwy epa mpg as the genesis v6, the tl with 6mt, has an epa composite of 21 mpg.	1
	which is 5% better than 20.  so the lexus has 5% more power but has 5% worse fuel economy based on the epa composite numbers than the genesis v6.	1
	again, that seems like a reasonable trade to me and not any proof that hyundai's engines are 'not up to snuff' compared to those of toyota.	1
	you could buy two really                 big                tanks of gas plus a                 really                nice night on the town with that extra 10% ($3,300).        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1672#msg1672re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [louiswei]        i thought we                 were                comparing the 2gr from the is 350 with the genesis 3.8l.	1
	no handicapping is needed to show that even the current 3.8l compares very well with the dual-injection 2gr-fse.	1
	the 2gr-fse has 5% more power, but with a 5% fe penalty.	1
	if it were really superior to hyundai's mill, it would no doubt have superior power without an equivalent fe penalty, would it not?	1
	anyone can add more power while dropping fe; that doesn't reek of superior technology to me.	1
	all i was musing is, what would the genesis 3.8 be able to do with direct injection, as on the 2gr-fse?	1
	i haven't seen any word yet on when that will happen, although i've seen rumors about the v8 getting direct injection.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1673#msg1673re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        hmm, seems like quite a few hyundai fans didn't do their home work.	1
	it is clear that hyundai is behind toyota in almost all area (has to, company size and rd money, simply).	1
	but this is not to say the gap is significant enough for average consumer needs.	1
	to me the brand image is the far bigger issue which i don't think hyundai can ever resolve... until a hexus come along maybe                                 during our visit to hyundai hq, company brass forthrightly addressed several pertinent issues about the new car for us.	1
	the new v8 doesn't feature direct-injection technology to attain its lofty horsepower figures.	1
	is d.i.	1
	a future possibility?	1
	absolutely, but this is only the first iteration of the all-new 4.6-liter tau engine family and it's meant to be relatively affordable to build, and it already features an elevated 6,500-rpm redline, fully variable valve timing, a variable-volume intake plenum, cast stainless-steel exhaust manifolds and ulev-ii level emissions.	1
	there's more to come.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1674#msg1674re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [backy]        like i said, there are already two 2gr owners today told you that the engine does return better mileage than epa's figures by around 2 mpg.	1
	let's just wait and see how would the hyundai 3.8l do in the real world once it is officially on sale.	1
	also, just let me remind you that a better comparison in both size and weight to the genesis 3.8l would be the gs350, which also has a 2gr-fse with 303 hp but not tuned as aggressively as the is350.	1
	according to epa the mileages for the gs350 are: 19/27/22       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1675#msg1675re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [louiswei]        yep, that 1 mpg is definitely worth all of the extra rd that the much bigger toyota has pumped into its engines over the years.	1
	maybe they can shift some of that rd to their i4s, so they can field a competitive 4-banger for their flagship camry.	1
	based on eight years of driving hyundais in the real world, on a daily basis, i am confident the genesis will have no problem exceeding its epa numbers also.	1
	i've had no problem doing that on any other hyundai (i4 or v6) i've driven.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1676#msg1676re: sorry, but had to bash mt a little [allmet33]         you disagree, but then say the same thing i just said!	1
	no.	1
	you feel that toyota has a big edge over hyundai in technology.	1
	i feel it isn't that great.	1
	you mentioned the 3.8, and while the displacement seems a bit less efficient (larger with the same output) then the 3.5 in the highlander, i thought iit drove just as well and handled as well.	1
	as for the price rising, i think it will continue to do so.	1
	when they are on a level where they can truely be accepted as playing with the 'big boys' they won't have to offer all of the equipment at a lower price, because it would be less profitable to do so.	1
	maybe you just can't see that happening because it's never occured before.	1
	i can't recall anyone rising from 'disposable cars' (not much more than 10 years ago) to cars as respectable as toyotas.	1
	toyotas and hondas were almost always respected, and never considered cheap.	1
	i can't think of any examples of any of the sonata's competitors expanding dramatically price wise.	1
	i don't think anyone has done it more than hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1677#msg1677re: headroom/seat adjustability [pat2717]        i sat in a genesis at the minneapolis auto show and at a local dealer.	1
	both were pre-production mules, but i feel confident that the interior dimensions won't change.	1
	it had very good head room.	1
	i'm only 5'10'  but had lots of room.	1
	the car felt bigger inside to me than an avalon and had more head room.	1
	i think it will have significantly more head room than the m.  the interior was beautifully finished.	1
	the design theme reminded me alot of the infiniti m, which i think has one of the most attractive interiors on the market.	1

	of superior folks).	1
	it may have slight advantage in the v6, but clearly hyundai has the right formula going with its first v8 and theta i4 (i.e.	1
	2.4l 175hp).	1
	fwiw, the genesis is almost a 2 ton car, so the return of horsepower rating and fuel efficiency are very respectable.	1
	also, the 3.8l v6 in the gen coupe pumps out 306 using regular and 313hp with premium fuel, iirc.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1679#msg1679re: genesis vs. gs [joe97]        i think we see many toyota fans espouse the 'superiority' of toyota engines because that's all that's left to explain why anyone would pay more for a toyota than for, say, a hyundai.	1
	toyota no longer has the big lead in reliability, no longer has the big lead in 'fit and finish' (many professional reviewers say it has lost its lead there), has fallen behind in safety and comfort features.	1
	what's left?	1
	'the engine has superior technology!'	1
	that may have been true not too many years ago.	1
	but others, including hyundai, have caught up.	1
	but if someone wants to pay a lot more money for a gs with a lower-powered, less-economical v8 instead of a genesis, and they want to believe it has a superior engine to the hyundai, it's their money and it's a free country.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1680#msg1680...        as far as i'm concerned, there's nothing that can touch the genesis for the price.	1
	for $38,000, the genesis is loaded extravagantly.	1
	a comparably-equipped gs350 costs $10,000+ more.	1
	a comparably-equipped es350, which isn't even in the same class as the genesis, still costs $4,000 more.	1
	the tls comes close, but it's more of a hotrod'ed last-generation accord v6 than a plush luxo yacht.	1
	again, not in the same class.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised if hyundai starts using di on their v6's within a year or two.	1
	my guess is that a di version of the 3.8l v6 would produce somewhere between 325 to 340 horsepower, and 280 to 290 lb-ft of torque, based on the % gains other engines have gotten from di.	1
	as far as fuel-economy between manufacturers is concerned, it varies slightly between models in most cases.	1
	consider this, however:  hyundai's volume-seller sedan gets better overall fe than toyota's volume-seller.	1
	the fact that toyota sells several times more vehicles doesn't impress me, since my experience with late-models from both manufacturers has shown me that the hyundai vehicles are actually more solidly-built overall.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1681#msg1681pathetic...        we can go on and on about toyota vs. hyundai.	1
	in a stupid comparison of fwd vs. rwd.	1

	it's a smaller car for crying out loud!!!	1
	also, claiming engine superiority of actual fe vs. a car that hasn't come out yet!	1
	what a waste of breath.... i don't understand how some can entertain the trolling here.	1
	to whom said that toyota and honda were always respected and never cheap; let me remind you that both of these companies almost went belly up here in the us for it's craptacular reliability and continuous problems with their vehicles.	1
	it took a long time but they came around to doing things right.	1
	- their brand image didn't turn around overnight.	1
	hyundai's have had a similar experience, except hyundai has turned around quicker than both of the above mentioned.	1
	hyundai's image will and has drawn attention, even to toyota's president - to say that he's not concerned about the big 3 or anyone else except hyundai - that says alot!!!	1
	so whether people are in denial or aren't willing to except that hyundai is taking names and are beating the competition with what they offer for less, including reliability, fit and finish and their top rated customer service.	1
	they'll never be respected.	1
	but that doesn't matter, cause the more people cover their eyes to see who's climbing the ladder the quickest, more hyundai's are being driven today than anyone ever cared to imagine.	1
	last time i checked, toyota has had more recalls this year and last year than any other car manufacturer.	1
	yes, we can go on and on, but really.... what's it worth?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1682#msg1682fanbois        yeah, the azera sure lit the world on fire against the intended competition (not), or any competitor, for that matter (not).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1684#msg1684re: fanbois [rotary]         hyundai probably has the worst resale value of any vehicle sold in the u.s.                                                  that is because despite making good cars they must offer rebates on every model they sell, just like the 'big' 2.5.  the genesis will be no different.	1
	within six - nine months after the initial surge wears off the rebates / 0 % financing / lease specials will arrive.	1
	fyi here is a sampling of the current rebates:                2009 sonata $1500 (a newly redesigned model)                2008 sonata $3000                2008 azera   $2000                2008 elantra  $1500                                even the 'hot' santa fe has $2000                                i guess what i am saying is the resale isn't as horrid as it seems because the actual transaction prices are lower.	1
	once (if it ever happens) hyundai can sell these machines w/o rebates most of the year the resale won't be nearly as bad.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1685#msg1685re: fanbois [rotary]        who are you talking to?	1
	by the way, this is a genesis thread, not an azera thread, not a bashing thread.	1
	unsubstantiated claims?	1
	let's see, take my previous post for example, genesis vs. gs, all of which were facts and readily available on the world wide web, either at manufacturer's webpage, or epa.	1
	please, amuse us and post some details instead of going around and asserting nonsense.	1
	i'll recognize facts, but some of you are so delusional, you still can't seem to get your heads around the fact that hyundai probably has the worst resale value of any vehicle sold in the u.s.                                this is off-topic but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt and give you the right answer - ready?	1
	you are wrong, it's not a fact, far from it, actually.	1
	oh, fact and probably don't mix well together                                please, can we get back to discussions of the genesis?	1
	thanks       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1686#msg1686re: fanbois [tjc78]        yes, hyundai's resale value isn't as stellar as toyota or honda, but it is far from the worst (average to just below average depending on models).	1
	fwiw, hyundai has improved its resale value a whole heck lot within the past few years.	1
	the arrivals of the genesis family and the continued quality products are only going to raise it even more.	1
	as for the rebates, lease/financing specials, everyone's got them.	1
	hyundai's isn't the only one having to rely on them to sell vehicles.	1
	these days, every automaker has had the need, especially, to use those discounts to get a few more sales.	1

	i've extended the lease on my infiniti through september so i can have a look at the genesis and make an informed decision.	1
	let's hope this car is as good as it sounds.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1689#msg1689re: genesis vs. gs [louiswei]        i think you meant 1ur-fse.	1
	2ur-fse is on the ls600h iirc.	1
	you would understand, i never said the toyota engines weren't impressive, but rather both hyundai and toyota applications are excellent.	1
	the whole point of the comparison i put up - hyundai is catching up very very fast, faster than a lot of people would want to admit (not you but to some people                                yes the genesis v6 3.8l is 0.3l larger than the toyota 3.5, but the output is regardless respectable 290hp on the genesis (18/27, regular gas); 306hp in the genesis coupe (313 with premium fuel).	1
	frankly, the 0.3l displacement difference is not worth aruging death over, in my opinion                                fwiw, the genesis v6 3.3l (which is not available for the north american market) puts out 264hp; the 3.3l v6 in the sonata gets 249hp.	1
	like backy said earlier, the lambda v6s *3.3  3.8) are very flexible.	1
	i don't think we've seen its highest potential yet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1690#msg1690re: genesis vs. gs [joe97]         frankly, the 0.3l displacement difference is not worth aruging death over, in my opinion                                really?	1
	because the nissan vq35hr in the g35 has 306hp, with little tweaks here and there plus 0.2l extra liter the vq37hr gains 24hp, that's 12hp per liter for your information.	1
	using that as the guideline the non-di 2gr-fe should put out around 305hp (on regular gas) if its displacement is increased by 0.3l and the 2gr-fse would reach over 340hp easily.	1
	still think that 0.3l is not important?	1
	let me just make it clear, throughout my posts i never once stated that the toyota engines are 'superior' than the hyundai counterparts.	1
	i was merely comparing them with the cold hard specs and facts.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1691#msg1691re: genesis vs. gs [louiswei]        it may be important to you but not to me.	1
	the whole point i was making with the gs/genesis comparison, the genesis can go head-to-head on the specs.	1
	like i said, toyota 3.5l v6 is better than hyudnai's 3.3/3.8 v6 but not by much; certainly not as much as some here claims.	1
	let's also not lose the perspective that both engine families are very very young!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1693#msg1693re: genesis [qth]        all of the reviews so far have been based on the korean-spec genesis, either the 3.8l v6 or the 4.6l v8 - a good number of journalists were invited out to hyundai's turf.	1
	that said, a small number of people have driven the north american spec genesis.	1

	they were looked at with the same disdain that hyundai has dealt with.	1
	trust me, it wasn't always a pretty picture for them.	1
	oh, i understand that.	1
	i'm not old enough to know first hand what the public thought when japenese automakers first arrived on us soil, but from what i've learned, though they weren't highly respected at first, the build quality was good.	1
	however, when hyundai arrived, the cars were considered disposable.	1
	until recently (2-3 years ago) hyundai quality wasn't as good as its competitors.	1
	this is why i say they never had to rise in stature from the cheap economy car to a respectable brand.	1
	but they did have to rise in stature because people were accustomed to buying american cars and nothing else.	1
	comparing the camry and sonata by price, the price on the camry can't have gone up too much, as the two are separated by 800 for the base model, and 2800 for a topline model (with no added options).	1
	i know this doesn't take into account equiption similarity, but at a glance, the two aren't priced too far apart.	1
	the sonata wasn't always that close to the cmary, though.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1707#msg1707re: change the subject [dave174]        i have the rest of the answers for you.	1
	yes, the v8 should be at your local dealer at the end of august.	1
	the first v8's were available to be ordered this week.	1
	it is a 2-3 month turnaround for the car to hit the ground since it is built in korea and then has to be put on a boat.	1
	also, yes, the cars are going to go through the portland port and then get put on rail to go to the texas and new england hubs for truck transport (didn't i post all of this already?).	1
	point being, if you are on the west coast, you should get the cars sooner than the rest of the country.	1
	as far as the option packages are concerned, i think that you will be in luck and be able to get what you want.	1
	the only two ways to get a v8 are the base at $38k and the tech pkg at $42k.	1
	as the guy that orders the cars for my dealership i am here to tell you that 100% of my v8's will be tech pkgs.	1
	why?	1
	well, if a person has decided that they are going to part with $38k for a hyundai, then they are prob the kind of person that wants as much content as they can get for their money.	1
	the other $4k only represents about a 10% price bump and in terms of financing only $60-$80 a month.	1
	i think that most dealers will feel the same way.	1
	one warning though.	1
	hyundai is taking a look at what delalers are ordering and then restricting certain colors and packages if they feel that too many are going into the mix.	1
	for example on the first run of v6's there was an abundance of pearl white paint and the tech packages ordered.	1
	on the second run you could not order that color or any with the tech pkg.	1
	point is that if you choose to order a car you might want to be sure that your delaer can get what you ask/pay for!!!	1
	whew!!	1
	shoot over any other questions you may have.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1708#msg1708re: change the subject        jeffreid,  have you posted all the color options before?	1
	i don't want to make you go through it again if you have but i have yet to see them listed here or on the other genesis forum that i check.	1
	i have seen all the pricing packages but am anxious to see if the dealers price these at, above or below the msrps...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1709#msg1709re: change the subject [viking967]        i had not posted any colors.	1
	but hey, i guess i can.	1
	black noir pearl                white satin pearl                platinum metallic                titanium gray metallic                sterling blue metallic                sapphire blue pearl                cabernet red pearl                champagne beige metallic                                all of these will have black, brown, and beige interior color options in some combination.	1
	for now, i would actually have to be in the order system to see which colors offer which interiors, but you get the point.	1
	as for pricing, that will of course, be up to each dealer.	1
	i intend to price ours at msrp and see where the market is.	1
	if we don't have much interest then, of course, the prices will come down.	1
	but hey, if there is a waiting list, then supply and demand will be at work there as well.	1
	there is only going to be about $2200-$2500 markup from invoice to sticker in these cars anyway.	1
	which for a hyundai is pretty generous.	1
	don't get me started down that path though.	1
	my point is that msrp would be a fair price to charge based on the amount of training and work that i think a salesperson will have to do in order to sell this car.	1
	most sales people are going to be paid 25%-30% of the profit over invoice.	1
	so you are talking about a max of $750 commission per sale.	1
	i think that the expectation from most people is going to be that their dealer and salesperson will be there to accomodate them for service appointments and questions that they have down the road.	1
	it's just my thinking that the guys at my store that will be authorized to sell this car need to have some reward for the work that they will be putting in.	1
	yeah, i'm the jerk boss that harps on product knowledge and product presentation, so i will have my people in training classes and off of the lot to get the opportunity to sell thins product.	1
	sorry for all the extra info.	1
	let me know if you want to know anything else.        	1

	i am really interested in the car and debating between this and an avalon limited.	1
	do you know what huyndai will offer for leasing packages?	1
	i have always bought before and never leased but i am losing my company car and didn't plan on having to buy a vehicle on short notice - so i am going to do a three year lease and then buy something new in three years.	1
	the avalon limited is pretty compelling from a lease perspective because of the high re-sale and corresponding low monthly rate.	1
	i would much prefer a loaded v-6 genesis but i am not sure how banks will handle computing the residual value on a new hyundai model.	1
	i am hoping that hyundai offers a good lease option that is competitive with the avalon to make my decision easier...       	1

	with that being the case, i'm not really sure what to tell you about lease specials.	1
	if i were to take a guess, my thought would be that the avalon would have a better lease payment based on the factors that you mentioned.	1
	also, with the experience that we have with the treatment of the veracruz, i am going to assume that hyundai is going to leave the dealers to go it alone in terms of the pricing.	1
	it was only within the last couple of months that we got any help on the veracruz.	1
	as far as the question about the internet specials, i'm not really sure what the question even is.	1
	i did not mean to say that every dealer was going to be at or over msrp and that you could not negotiate price.	1
	i was probably just rambling a little about the markup part.	1
	there will be dealers at every price point on this car.	1
	at, over, and under msrp and invoice.	1
	i just think that it's kind of crazy not to try and make a reasonable profit on any product that you sell in any business.	1
	that was all i was saying.	1
	thanks for the question.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1713#msg1713re: change the subject [jeffreid]        sorry i was not more clear about my question on internet selling.	1
	you said:                                 my point is that msrp would be a fair price to charge based on the amount of training and work that i think a salesperson will have to do in order to sell this car.	1
	most sales people are going to be paid 25%-30% of the profit over invoice.	1
	so you are talking about a max of $750 commission per sale.	1
	i think that the expectation from most people is going to be that their dealer and salesperson will be there to accomodate them for service appointments and questions that they have down the road.	1
	it's just my thinking that the guys at my store that will be authorized to sell this car need to have some reward for the work that they will be putting in.	1
	on an internet sale, there is no special work that a sales rep needs to do on a genesis.	1
	the buyer knows what he/she wants, communicates with the internet sales rep about availability and price, they strike a deal, and the buyer comes in (maybe from out of state), does the paperwork, and drives off in the car.	1
	the rep should take a few minutes to point out the key features of the car, but that would be true for any car (just a few more features to cover on the genesis vs. a typical hyundai).	1
	anyway, what you said led me to believe that perhaps dealers would not be permitted to sell the genesis through the internet, with internet pricing.	1
	that all deals would go through special 'genesis reps' with special training.	1
	that's why i asked my question.	1
	thanks for the clarification.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1714#msg1714re: change the subject [backy]        i see now what you are getting at.	1
	i'm sorry that i was confused.	1
	there is nothing that hyundai motor america is doing that will make any dealer handle the genesis in any particluar way.	1
	i am going to set up my two best sales people to handle all genesis traffic simply to ensure that each person interested in that car gets the best treatment.	1
	i'm sure many people have been to delaerships where there is little or no sales training and they get stuck with the guy that can barely carry on a converstaion or even tie his shoes.	1
	i just want to be sure that the 'elevated' clients that we will be seeing on this car are handled in a manner that they will be happy with, a la lexus.	1
	as far as the internet pricing is concerned, that is just going to be a dealer to dealer decision.	1
	i do not think that any dealer with an internet department will shy away from selling this car via that outlet.	1
	the pricing is going to go by supply and demand.	1
	it will be that simple.	1
	with a fairly small supply virtually certain it is going to be interesting to see how many people are going to show up and sign the dotted line.	1
	if there are only a few (azera/xg300/xg350) then you, as a dealer,  will have to compete on price a bunch to move the metal.	1
	however if the santa fe launch at the end of 2000 or the first of 2001 repeats itself, then you, as a consumer,  will have to get in line to get a car and pay for it.	1
	i like to haggle on stuff as much as anyone.	1
	ask the lady that built my house.	1
	but hey, as it has been said many times here and other places, this car should be hanging with cars that are $10k-$20k more expensive.	1
	even at msrp, the case can be made that you getting a heck of a deal.	1
	that was really all i was getting at.	1
	do some research here on edmunds and get tmv and invoice data.	1
	make and offer and see what kind of response you get.	1
	it never hurts to ask for some money off.	1
	you might get it        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1715#msg1715re: change the subject [jeffreid]        i don't think you'll have trouble getting msrp for the genesis while suppy is limited.	1
	for how long that will last, who knows?	1
	if each dealer only has 2-3 at a time, prices could stay up for a long time.	1
	i remember when the 2006 sonata and azera were introduced, some dealers were asking sticker or above for them.	1
	but the few 'gotta have the all-new sonata/azera' buyers were satiated pretty quickly, and prices got more real.	1
	of course, sonatas sell at 10,000-15,000 per                 month                .       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1716#msg1716re: change the subject [backy]        well said sir.	1
	with the genesis being a 20,000 unit                 per year                model, and hyundai saying that they are going to turn a profit on them at the prices that are at, i expect them to keep the incentives at bay however.	1
	expecting to get msrp or over on a high volume model for any length of time is a little silly.	1
	heck, chevy can't even get msrp on a corvette a month or so after launch of a new model.	1
	you know though, i don't think that too many dealers are going to be stuck on msrp on principle.	1
	if a person has an opportunity to record a sale and put a reasonable profit on the books, i think that most would be willing to come down some on the price.	1
	even from the start.	1
	just thinking out loud.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1717#msg1717re: change the subject [backy]        i am curious as to how genesis sales will be in a year or two.	1
	it took 'value' buyers little time to jump on a say sonata if it performs close to camry/accord yet is cheaper.	1
	these buys will also defend hyundai so fiercely as to how it's already very close to the big boys in many aspects.	1
	however, when hyundai moves upward to azera (failing soon) and genesis, it is quite a different story.	1
	one can talk all day how good these cars are and what great 'value' they represent compared to the competitors.	1
	many people can talk the talk, but how many are really ready to walk the walk -- buy a 30-40k hyundai?	1
	brand factor plays a huge part in luxury car buying (unlike 'utility' car in say i don't think you'll have trouble getting msrp for the genesis while suppy is limited.	1
	for how long that will last, who knows?	1
	if each dealer only has 2-3 at a time, prices could stay up for a long time.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1718#msg1718re: change the subject [jeffreid]        i think you should have ordered at least one base v8.	1
	there are those out there (like myself) who sometimes want the bare bones model.	1
	i don't need a navi screen.	1
	also, advertising that you have a genesis v8 model under 40g would get more people excited and in the door, then the sales reps could get potential customers to pay out a bit more.	1
	except for the stubborn ones who can't be swayed.	1
	when you pay 42g for one w/ the tech package, does that mean there are no options?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1719#msg1719re: change the subject [ctl]        ok, let's stop back here in june 2010 and do a check on how the genesis is doing.	1

	is the lexicon audio system in a class all its own and really state of the art?	1
	could an extended bumper to bumper warranty be offered after the 5 yr 60k ?	1
	any idea what the service schedule may be?	1
	any idea yet what the main colors are being ordered by the dealers?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1722#msg1722re: change the subject [dave174]        on the warranty questions, if hyundai follows the same policies as for its other models, wear items like batteries and brakes will be warranted for 1 year/12k miles, and some items like tires and batteries on a pro-rated warranty beyond that.	1
	and hyundai already offers an extended warranty that takes bumper-to-bumper coverage to 10 years/100k miles, so i don't see why the genesis wouldn't have that kind of warranty available.	1
	here's all the details on the hyundai warranty for the u.s.:                 http://www.hyundaiusa.com/global/warranty/warranty.aspx        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1723#msg1723re: japanese cars in ancient history        for those of you whose age i wish i was...                                the first hondas in this country were smaller than the first civics, and much much worse.	1
	they had engines half the size of today's nicer honda motorcycles.	1
	the first accord was smaller than today's honda fit, i'm guessing, and certainly had less room.	1
	the first subaru cars here were particularly laughable.	1
	they were smaller than today's smart fortwo, and they were unmitigated crap.	1
	corollas throughout the 70s and 80s, huge successes that made toyota credible in america, had bulletproof drivetrains (so long as you remembered to adjust the valve clearances) but rusted like chevy trucks.	1
	i recall saying affectionately for years that a corolla's engine would still be running as the body crumbled into a pile of oxide around it, which proved true with several editions in my own family.	1
	and while we lump toyota and honda reliability together today, they were more distinctly different then.	1
	civics were more like cars you'd expect from a maker of race cars and motorcycles.	1
	even the civics that helped build honda's reputation for economy, tossability and reliability were high-strung, lightweight cars that were trouble-free and fun for about 3 years and then could be tossed in the ashcan, being used up both under the hood and in the rapidly rusting sheetmetal.	1
	what's different about hyundai's ascent is mostly that 1) they didn't do it first, and 2) partly because of that, they're doing it a lot faster.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1724#msg1724going to wait...        i just leased a sonata - love it.	1
	my dealer was absolutely the best to deal with - can't believe it was such a positive easy experience.	1
	did a 2 year lease so i can see how things shake out with the genesis, then lease or buy one then.	1
	it seems to be one of nicest packages out there, based on the pix i've seen, etc.	1
	btw - i got rid of a clk320, and test drove an infiniti, a maxima, a mercedes c-class, the azzera and some others.	1
	the sonata just had everything and i couldn't beat the price and the sales experience...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1725#msg1725re: change the subject [dave174]        some of these questions (warranty) have already been answered, but i thought i would take a stab at the rest.	1
	as to the cali emissions, the genesis is rated as a ulev ii vehicle and (as are all hyundai vehicles) meets emissions requirements in all 50 states.	1
	i haven't heard the sound system yet.	1
	10 days and counting.	1
	but there has been so much made of the comapro between this system and the rolls system that you would have to think that it would be pretty good.	1
	also, the service schedule should have a requirement of 6mo/7500 miles on regular oil changes and then a transmission service at 60k or 90k depending on how you read your owners manual.	1
	other than that it should be pretty mucgh gas and go.	1
	the colors are up to each dealer, but i'll tell you one thing for sure.	1
	white satin pearl will be in no short supply.	1
	after the first order batch, hyundai sent out order #2 and said no pearl white and no tech packages!!	1
	why?	1
	b/c all of us hyundai dealers ordered exactly that since we thought that would look and sell the best.	1
	almost any dealer should be able to take your order right now.	1
	mmmm, so, hard, not, to, ask, for, the, sale.......                                   hope this was helpful.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1726#msg1726re: change the subject [jeffreid]        i am interested in the sterling blue metallic and sapphire blue pearl colors.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1727#msg1727re: change the subject [tom17]        the sapphire blue will be the dark, navy-like blue and then the sterling blue will, i think, be very similar to the medium silver blue on the 2009 sonata.	1

	in my area, there isn't a model in the hyundai line that is sold                 at                msrp,                 without                rebates and                 without                dealer participation resulting in even further price reductions..  genesis will be no different.	1
	if the genesis guru dealer salesperson has to be compensated more for doing their job at the expense of the consumer via pricing, you've just admitted that genesis sales will be uphill beginning the day of the launch.	1
	salesperson training is the responsibility of dealer management and hyundai factory field reps.  hyundai has the added responsibility of training service department personnel writing the service order, and those performing the repairs.	1
	using azera as a recent example, those factory efforts failed miserably.       	1

	[mbholla]        well, we are all waiting for this car to appear in showrooms, i work in costa mesa, ca and every day on my way to and from work, i drive by the hyundai headquarters in fountain valley, ca.	1
	their parking lot is visible from the 405 fwy.	1
	last week as i was driving by on my way home, i just happened to look to my right and saw a burgundy genesis parked facing the fwy.	1
	the next day i saw another one, so i decided to get off the fwy and go take a look.	1
	i went inside hyundai hq but nobody there could (or would) tell me anything but they said it was ok if i had a look at the car.	1
	i could not get inside, but from the outside the car is very nice.	1
	take off the nameplate and you would think you were looking at a new ls460!	1

	said another way, the car is a good deal even at msrp.	1
	if chevrolet decided that they would price corvette's at $25,000, but there was no price haggling, would it be any less of a great deal?	1
	i agree with you that it will be a challenge to get this car rolling.	1
	that's my opinion.	1
	glad you agree.	1
	and since you took that part of my comment out of context, i would like to say again that invoice to msrp on this car is only about 5%-6%.	1
	i was saying in that comment that with the small (compared to toyota and most domestic makes) markup that hyundai usually has in their cars that the spread was a fair profit to ask on a $35k-$40k product (of any type).	1
	please, if all of your responses are going to be 'i'm not ever going to pay msrp for that car or any other, and you're a crook to try and get it........' save me the trouble.	1
	i'm just putting some factual information out to the public and then throwing in some inside opinion to try and help out those looking for some insight.	1

	fully loaded 2009 hyundai genesis v-6 or the new 2009 nissan maxima as tested in the following link:                                 http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/drives/fulltests/articleid=126520                                assuming that i can get the maxima or the genesis for ~$38k (which would be closer to the invoice for the genesis), the main differences that i see are just  (1) rwd vs. fwd, (2) genesis is bigger and (3) maxima uses premium fuel only?	1
	otherwise, they both appear to have luxurious interiors and all the bells/whistles.	1

	the genesis is $38k sticker, depending on supply/demand, it will likely be sold for $37k, in the same price range as maxima.	1
	my hunch is that maxima will be more fun to drive but for those who want the roomy rear seats, genesis may be their choice.	1
	nissan maxima is more proven imho, but what it comes down to is really driving the car and see how it handles the road.	1
	all things being equal, even if genesis has a bit of an edge over others, the resale and maintability is still questionable.	1
	so, if hyundai dealers became snobbish and keep the pricing at sticker or above, then i'll definitely go for maxima (or a few other choices at the $35k range).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1743#msg1743re: change the subject (slightly) [viking967]         okay, i am down to two car choices and would like to hear some input.	1
	fully loaded 2009 hyundai genesis v-6 or the new 2009 nissan maxima                                hmm.	1
	i mentioned a little comparison b/t these two in the 2009 maxima board.	1
	i think it really comes down to size.	1
	the genesis is half a foot longer.	1
	but  that's it.	1
	the v-6s are about the same.	1
	the genesis should be only a little slower.	1
	but the genesis would be more like driving an infiniti m. the genesis would be much bigger inside.	1
	i think i'd go with the genesis.	1
	but i've only seen the maxima from the outside, not the inside.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1744#msg1744genesis/maxima/g8        i think good comparison test would be the genesis vs the maxima vs the g8.	1
	this test would be more geared toward the maxima, because the genesis compares more to its luxury side, while the g8 would give its sporty side a run.	1
	sorry for getting off topic.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1745#msg1745re: change the subject (slightly) [bcheng]        just nitpicking, but the loaded out v6 genesis would sticker for $37k not $38k.	1
	so if you still got the same $1000 off that you were figuring, you would be able to get a genesis with the tech pkg for $36k.	1
	in terms of fun to drive, a rear wheel drive usually has the advantage.	1
	who knows about resale right now, really?	1
	if the genesis is as solid a performer as we hope, then it will remain desireable over time, and as such, retain its value.	1
	also, maintainence should be at a minimum with this car.	1
	6 months/7500 miles oil changes.	1
	1 transmission serive in the first 100,000 miles.	1
	here in a few weeks we can drive the cars and that will be the easiest way to make the decision.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1746#msg1746re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        maybe the edmunds pricing options calculation is wrong then.	1
	it says the tech package ($4k) requires premium plus ($1k), which adds up to $38k.	1
	what i meant about maintenance is the potential repair hassle.	1
	when a new model comes out, it often takes a few years to work out the kinks.	1
	so, for example, i would hate to have to bring my car in every 3 months to get things repaired.	1
	don't get me wrong, i am still very positive about the genesis (hence checking this board), so i can't wait to test drive the car and compare it head-to-head with others in similar price range.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1747#msg1747re: change the subject (slightly) [bcheng]         when a new model comes out, it often takes a few years to work out the kinks.	1
	so, for example, i would hate to have to bring my car in every 3 months to get things repaired.	1
	fwiw, we jumped on the new generation 2007 sf and the only thing it went in for was a bad o2 sensor.	1
	after 20k miles, no bugs and no problems!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1748#msg1748re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        should have clarified on the pricing assumptions:                                v-6g base = $33k                +$2k for premium package                +$1k for 18' wheels                +$4k for tech package                = $40k -- less 7% gets you to an approx invoice cost of $37.2k       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1749#msg1749re: change the subject (slightly) [bcheng]        you don't have to add the packages together like that.	1
	when you get the tech pkg it 'includes' the prem plus.	1
	same as the prem plus pkg comes with the prem pkg.	1
	thst is where the difference in price is.	1
	the spirit of what you are saying is pretty accurate about maintainence usually.	1
	two things to keep in mind though.	1
	hyundai sends all of it's new models to korea for 6mo or a year to try and work out the bugs before they put the new stuff on sale here.	1
	and also, each new model goes to the death valley test facility for about 6mo for the same long term testing.	1
	that usually gets most of the bugs out.	1
	hyundai is really big on keeping little glitches out of their cars right now.	1
	they have no hope of turning their brand into a premium player if they have the 'new car glitches' every three months.	1
	by the way, if you don't really have to have nav, you might wait a couple of months and get a base v8 for $38k.	1
	you would still get the wheels and the roof and that sort of stuff.	1
	just an idea.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1750#msg1750re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        jeffreid, thanks for the clarification on pricing, and hope edmunds.com can correct their site information.	1
	i really have my eyes set on a car with nav system.	1
	as for v6 or v8, i currently have a german luxury car with v8 engine that guzzles gas at an average of 15 mpg, and i wanted to 'downgrade' to a more practical car with a v6 engine.	1
	but i don't want to let go of the cabin niceties - a guy's gotta have his toys, right?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1751#msg1751re: change the subject [jeffreid]        you take a few things out of context too (from my original post) but in any event, keep us informed how many you sell                 at msrp                .       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1752#msg1752re: change the subject (slightly) [albook]        well...the interior of the '09 maxima is rather astonishing (in terms of maxima interiors).	1
	i mean...it actually looks more like something that should be in one of the infiniti cars.	1
	maximas have always done pretty good, i think this will be the best one yet.	1
	i think another thing that could lean in the favor of the maxima is that it's fwd.	1
	in terms of inclement weather...the max would have the edge compared to the rwd genesis.	1
	some folks don't feel the fwd vs. rwd is a factor, but you have quite a few folks that aren't comfortable with rwd as it gives a different driving dynamic as compared to fwd.	1
	personally...i don't think you could go wrong with either car.	1
	in terms of which to choose...if you want a car with more athletic leanings...get the max (it certainly has touches of luxury this go 'round to boot), but if you want something more classy and luxurious...the genesis would be the choice.       	1

	probably at $26k with the automatic.	1
	plus hyundai has no history of making hot sporty cars.	1
	on the other hand, you can get a base se 2009 dodge challenger with a v-6 and auto transmission for $22k.	1
	the challenger se comes with a 3.5-liter v6, which makes 250 hp and is paired with a four-speed automatic.	1
	other standard equipment includes 17-inch aluminum wheels, four-wheel-disc brakes and keyless entry.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1758#msg1758re: i'm less impressed with coupe price [gary045]        i don't know about you but a 4 spd does not make me want a challenger, much less an auto tranny.	1
	if i was in the market for one, i would probably get either the r/t or the srt trims, in stick - sorry but the se doesn't sound attractive at all to me.	1
	just checked out the pricing for the challenger, a big difference between the base and the srt (w/ the add'l gas-guzzler tax) - terrible fuel economy by the way.	1
	the genesis coupe official pricing has not been annouced yet but here is what's known:                                i4 turbo 212hp/223hp; v6 306hp/313hp - choices of 6 spd manual/auto trannies, lsd, brembo, hid - rumored pricing sub 20k for the turbo 4 and mid 20s for the v6, i'd wish there are more affordable rwd coupes out there.	1
	by the way, good luck finding a genesis v6 auto for 19-20k anytime soon...       	1

	if i remember correctly from another post, you are a hyundai dealer - so i take that as correct info.	1

	can you please take a look and clarify?	1
	thanks!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1761#msg1761re: change the subject (slightly) [viking967]        morning viking.	1
	i actually have the exact same information sitting in a folder directly to my left as we speak.	1
	the correct answer is that if you buy the tech pkg for $4,000 then you get all of the rest of the packages as well.	1
	that means that the v6 with all options should be $37,000.	1
	i was a little confused about the wording myself so i called my district rep and he confirmed that this is correct.	1
	i am getting my information from a person that works for hyundai motor america at a pretty high level.	1
	however, if he is wrong then so am i. one other reason that i am fairly confident about this is that when i order these cars, i can only pick one option package.	1
	if i was having to pay for each one seperately then i should have to choose to buy each package.	1
	on a whole different note, i would like to offer my sincere (maybe) appologizes to this board for my post about the pricing of this car being fair.	1
	i did not mean to start a debate about msrp vs. discounted prices and all of that.	1
	i was just making some observations that got taken a bit too far.	1
	oh, on a genesis product note.	1
	we got a very interesting call yesterday.	1
	our district rep gave us the 'your car may be delayed a bit in arriving, but if you take one or two more, i'll be sure to get them to you on time' speech.	1
	what this may mean for you guys/ladies is that there may be more production capacity or vehicle stock available than we were led to believe.	1
	i am going to guess that most dealers are not taking their full allocation (just as we didn't) and that hyundai is trying to get the line moving.	1
	this may make it easier to order what you want, but maybe a little harder to find that perfect color/equipment package right off the bat.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1762#msg1762re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        jeffreid,  that is great news!	1
	if i can get it for somewhere between $35-$37k (projected invoice - msrp) - even if it is closer to the $37k - then i think it would push me over the edge to go with the genesis instead of the '09 maxima.	1
	i really do like the body style and the interior of the maxima, but at $35-$37k the genesis wins in my mind based mostly on the larger size and somewhat on the rwd.	1
	i still need to drive both of them but that is where i am right now.	1
	my only remainng concern is about a stiffer depriciation on the genesis vs. projected maxima.	1
	hard to know since this is year one of the model...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1763#msg1763re: adaptive cruise control  availability        can someone explain why adaptive cruise control is a later option and would not be available now?	1
	also, what is '                 later                ' ?	1
	if hyundai has been making these cars in south korea for a number of months and selling them there, do they have adaptive cruise control?	1
	one other question, what is the city/highway mpg for the v6 vs the v8?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1764#msg1764re: adaptive cruise control  availability [ljf]        adaptive curise control is available in the home market genesis, and has been since launch.	1
	i'd venture to guess it's not here yet on the us model due to the weak dollars.	1
	the epa fuel effiicency ratings:                                v6 - 18/27                v8 - 17/25                                both ratings are very very good.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1765#msg1765re: change the subject (slightly) [viking967]        do you plan to keep the new vehicle for only a year or two or for an extended period of time?	1
	if you are going to trade in the very near future then the maxima may make a better short term deal financially, especially if you are going to continue to trade at a nissan dealer.	1
	it seems as though the maxima customer is pretty loyal, and as such, a nissan dealer would put some extra money into a car that was only a year or so old.	1
	the flip side of this is that if you usually keep a car for a while then the value may not be a big deal.	1
	in 10 years, you have a ten year old car no matter what.	1
	past that, the genesis will be under warranty longer, possibly offsetting some potential costs vs. the max.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1766#msg1766re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]         in 10 years, you have a ten year old car no matter what.	1
	uh, well, a ten year old lexus isn't just a ten year old car.	1
	dealers think they can still get ridiculous amounts on these cars.	1
	if the genesis was really in that category, then resale value wouldn't plummet.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1768#msg1768re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        i was looking at the pricing/options on the following link and was a bit confused                .	1
	http://genesisowners.com/hyundai-genesis-forum/showthread.php?t=136                                the base v6 is $33,000.	1
	the base v8 is $38,000.	1
	the base v8 is equipped like a premium plus packaged v6 (supposedly $36,000, or is it $34,000 since only one package can be picked                ), but also includes such niceties as:                                'ultra'-premium leather                power sunshade                electrochromatic outside mirrors                illuminated scuff plates                chrome body-side moldings                wooden trimmed steering wheel                                let alone the obvious engine upgrade and an arguably better transmission (zf instead of aisin).	1
	all those 'extra' things are probably worth around $1,000, so the engine/tranny upgrade is basically only $1,000 more, or only about $2,000 more than the premium packaged v6 with the 17 inch wheels/tires.	1
	this makes the base v8 look like a great value compared to the premium plus or even premium packaged v6.	1
	where things get really strange is with the tech package.	1
	for just $1,000 more ($37,000), you can get:                                navigation system/backup camera                hid auto-leveling headlights with auto-cornering                cooled driver seat                upgraded lexicon audio system (17 speakers, 528 watts, logic 7)                some other stuff integrated with the nav (driver info system, multimedia controller)                parking sensors (redundant with the backup camera, at least the rear sensors)                                separately, all that stuff might be worth around $2,500 or so, but not the $4,000 that you need to pay to get it on the v8.	1
	a nice aftermarket gps might cost around $500 (no backup camera though), a decent hid setup will also be around $500, but probably no auto-cornering.	1
	does the 15 speaker lexicon really need to be upgraded?	1
	the cooled driver seat is nice for hot summers, but again it's just the driver's seat which is kind of half-a$$ed, no pun intended.	1
	so it appears the best value is the loaded v6 for $37,000 or the base v8 for $38,000.	1
	that is unless you can do without the lexicon audio system and moonroof, which is basically what the premium package is (i guess you also do get rain sensing wipers and auto defogging windshield, and a leather wrapped dash).	1
	in that case you can pay $33,000 for a base v6, but then you get a genesis that's equipped comparable to a limited sonata without navigation, for around $10,000 more (tmv pricing).	1
	you do get a smart key and an acoustic windshield which is not available on the sonata, but you don't get a moonroof on the base genesis either.	1
	a much better equipped limited azera with ultimate package, even with navigation is around $3,000 less (again tmv pricing).	1
	don't get me wrong, i'm sure the genesis is a better car.	1
	it has a better transmission, better lambda engine, probably better interior and paint, rear wheel drive with better handling.	1
	but compared to the lesser hyundai offerings, it doesn't really provide better value.	1
	if that's how the pricing/options are working out, what to do?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1769#msg1769re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        jeffreid, thanks for your posts.	1
	it really helped me clarify ambiguities regarding the genesis pricing.	1
	the only thing that i'm still confused, though, is that the technology package for both v6 and v8 has the same features at the same price ($4,000).	1
	but it sounds like you're suggesting that the tech package for v6 includes premium plus package as well (so the loaded v6 has an msrp of $37,000).	1
	would it be so that hyundai gives $3,000 worth of package for free?	1
	it seems not reasonable to assume that be the case.	1
	again, i appreciate your insider's comments on pricing et al.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1770#msg1770re: change the subject (slightly) [akuma]        i don't think it's fair to compare it like that.	1
	it's kind like justifying a gs over an es, or an avalon....                                yes, the genesis is more expensive than the azera, and much more when compared to the sonata - as it should be.	1
	at which point is that premium not worth the upgrade, well, that, everyone may have a different opinion.	1
	fwiw, the pricing range for the genesis is great to me.	1
	i don't know if i can find a more competitive rwd luxury/sport (more luxury) sedan for what the price it's asking for.	1
	the other thing that works well with the pricing - it doesn't step on the toes of the azera.	1
	like most automakers, there is a natural progression with hyundai's line in terms of product and price.	1
	if nothing else, the genesis will bring the intanible goods to the brand and the rest of the line, it provides empahsis on the brand - it's not a hyundai genesis, rather, the genesis, from hyundai        	1

	i was making a point about how car makers like to jack up prices on stuff they think people 'gotta have' like hp.	1
	i find it kinda funny that dodge would charge $18k on top of the base price of $22k for the srt8 'hemi eng' gas guzzling model.	1
	and it appears 11 thousand people in a country of 300 million would want to buy it for $40k and keep it in their garage as a collector or whatever with gas at $4 or better.	1
	but in order to sell enough to make the challenger worth making, dodge hands out a basic model for $22k...lol                                the srt8 comes with the 6.1-liter hemi v8 that pumps out 425 hp.	1
	five-speed automatic and six-speed manual transmissions are available.	1
	standard equipment includes 20-inch forged aluminum wheels and functional hood scoops.	1
	the race-inspired interior has reconfigurable displays that show 0-to-60-mph and lap times.	1
	dodge launched the challenger this year as an '08 with limited availability--only 6400 were available, outfitted as srt8s--and the automaker got more than 11,000 requests to buy the car.	1
	i like the progress and work hyundai has done over the yrs, but they need to prove themselves a little more in the muscle car/ luxury sector before they jump out with products with no history and want to charge premium prices.	1
	when hyundais have the resale value of say a honda, then they can  jack up prices all you want.	1
	till then, don't get ahead of yourself.............       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1774#msg1774re: i'm less impressed with coupe price [gary045]         i like the progress and work hyundai has done over the yrs, but they need to prove themselves a little more in the muscle car/ luxury sector before they jump out with products with no history and want to charge premium prices.	1
	agreed for the most part.	1
	hyundai has to continue to do everything they have done and more to have a stronger establishment of the brand in the us market, for example.	1
	the genesis lineup (coupe and sedan), veracruz, azera are great starts laying down the foundation it needed, but still a lot of work ahead.	1
	in terms of charging premium pricing, i am not sure if i'd agree.	1
	we were on the subject of the genesis coupe, i believe?	1
	well, the rumored pricing on the coupe (i.e.	1
	sub-20 for the turbo 4; and mis 20 on the v6), i don't agree it is at a premium - actually, very affordable, as a matter of fact.	1
	even the genesis sedan, is almost untouchable for everything it offers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1775#msg1775re: change the subject (slightly) [joe97]        actually, my main point was that the options pricing (in particular tech package with v6 and v8) was unusual in that the v8 already was equipped like a premium plus packaged v6, but priced only about $2,000 more than the v6 with said package, but priced $5,000 more than the tech packaged v6.	1
	i already said that the base v8 was a great value.	1
	there is no v8 rear-wheel sedan that can touch it except maybe pontiac g8.	1
	the 300c srt-8 is a few thousand more with crummy gas mileage 13/18, and is probably worse at both luxury and sport, but it still sold over 100,000 units a year for most of its cycle (the whole 300c line).	1
	my comparing the genesis (v6) with sonata and azera is that they are all full sized cars within the same company and still within $10,000 of each other.	1
	all 3 cars will be at the same dealership.	1
	the lexus gs is a little over $10,000 than es but equipped better: hids, power folding, electrochromatic, reverse tilting mirrors, multi-level heated seats, better stock stereo, bluetooth, etc.	1
	the base gs is also equipped better than the avalon at any trim, although those two cars are more different (dimensions, purpose) than genesis and sonata.	1
	actually the avalon limited is better equipped than even the base genesis v8.	1
	that was more my point with the comparison.	1
	not that sonata shoppers will strongly consider genesis or vice versa, but that shouldn't the genesis (a true luxury sedan even in base v6 trim) have more separation (feature content) between it and a family sedan like the sonata limited?	1
	as for azera, the only options the tech packaged v6 genesis will appear to have over it are the lexicon system, backup camera, parking sensors, ventillated driver's seat, hid lights, keyless ignition, leather wrapped dash, auto defogging acoustic windshield, but it still won't have power folding mirrors, power adjustable pedals, or sunshade(?).	1
	but who knows?	1
	maybe there are all these other neat features on the genesis that hasn't been disclosed.	1
	what hyundai needs is for the 3.8 genesis to be very different from the 3.8 azera as their pricing (msrp) whether fully loaded or base is only about $4,000 apart although it can get as little as $1,000 when comparing loaded azera with base genesis or as much as $8,000 when comparing loaded genesis with base azera..                                my guess is that the 3.8 genesis doesn't drive that differently than the azera at 7/10ths driving, or most normal driving.	1
	only the v8 gets upgraded brakes for seemingly no extra cost.	1
	yet another reason to get the v8.	1
	all 3 cars will probably have similar acceleration and braking numbers.	1
	this isn't a diss to the genesis, but more like praise to the sonata and azera.	1
	more the sonata than azera, because it looks like hyundai has neglected the azera.	1
	it wasn't refreshed at all.	1
	the gls with the 3.3 lambda only makes 234 hp compared to sonata's 249 with worse mileage at 18/26 compared to sonata's 19/29.	1
	and the azera actually costs more despite being equipped worse.	1
	no leather, no moonroof, heated seats, premium stereo, etc.	1
	but that's another story for another post.	1
	it could come down to marketing.	1
	make the genesis the much more desirable car, and even potential azera customers step up to the genesis.	1
	the ones that can't afford the genesis or aren't willing for whatever reason to pay around $40,000 out the door for a hyundai can buy a $20,000 sonata instead or stick with the azera.	1
	the halo effect, so to speak.	1
	but again, who really knows what kind of customers will buy the genesis?	1
	maybe it will be sonata/azera owners looking to move up.	1
	or avalon/300c customers that want better value, luxury or power, handling, or something.	1
	or maybe even infiniti/lexus/acura/volkswagen/volvo customers voting with their dollars.	1
	the unthinkable might even happen and a bmw or mercedes owner trades in their comparably overpriced vehicles.	1
	didn't mean to get so long winded.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1776#msg1776re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        jeffreid-first let me thank you for being so helpful and trying to help those of us who are hopeful that this car is as good as it seems.	1
	i have gotten to know the local hyundai dealer here in arizona pretty well-and to be honest-they don't understand the pricing for options.	1
	the manager told me that premium, premium plus and tech package could all be ordered separate and they did not depend on each other.	1
	if the purchase of a 4k tech package gets me premium and premium plus this is a great deal-but my dealer told me that this isn't the way it works.	1
	the district rep is advising him-seems like there needs to be something written up that defines this better.	1
	there are package numbers associated with these options that the dealers can't explain-                so of course they can't explain to potential buyers.	1
	is the wording that bad on the options sheet and the 4k buys you all the subordinate packages ?	1
	what do you expect the timeframe for a fully loaded v8 to be available ?	1
	thanks again       	1

	maybe they're right, or maybe they're wrong.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1778#msg1778re: genesis not ready to compete with lexus or infiniti [rotary]         excerpted from popular mechanics                  the bottom line:                 but thats the rub with the genesis.	1
	the genesis is a good car that gets nearly to luxury levels.	1

	considering were even comparing this hyundai with the leaders like bmw and lexus, that says a lot.	1
	we suspect hyundai will reach those same levels in due time.	1
	of all the reviews and previews of genesis that i have read, this publication was the most lukewarm and falsely nitpicky.	1
	their assertion that 'fit and finish' wasn't up to par is awfully judgmental, awfully badly biased.	1
	their claim is not supported by the vast majority of reviewers.	1
	at least not according to autoblog, edmunds, winding road, automobile, car and driver, motor trend, etc.	1
	that wouldn't compare favorably to bmws 530 series, or mercedes e series or lexus' gs.	1
	certainly, there are some legitimate critiques of the driving characteristics of genesis, but fit and finish isn't one of them.	1
	having read the entire review from pm and knowing their hyundai bashing history, there should be an *asterisk* labeled                 'bias'                checked off against them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1779#msg1779re: genesis not ready to compete with lexus or infiniti [rotary]        the road test and review they gave looks pretty fair to  me.	1
	they did bash the genesis a bit about the tolerance, but also stated that they were driving a pre-production model and that hyundai would probably work any shortcomings out in time.	1
	i read the article and if i knew nothing else about the genesis, i would still go and consider one based on their article.	1
	a lot of these journalists are way too picky and anal retentive-in my opinion.	1
	looks like they may definitely be leaning toward japanese and german luxury cars-they probably get freebies and goodies from the established luxury car makers and don't want that to dry up....just my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1780#msg1780re: change the subject (slightly) [viking967]        it seem to be improper use of 'just' to call that kind of difference between genesis and maxima 'just'.	1
	rwd vs. fwd / size / fuel economy are the most critical factors of car specification.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1781#msg1781re: change the subject (slightly) [deeezldoc]        okay, lets start with the option package situation.	1
	i agree that the wording on the option packages is really confusing and that the pricing makes even less sense.	1
	however, if your local dealer told you that you can order the packages seperately, and that do not depend on each other, then they are either not paying attention, or you got in touch with someone that really isn't that involved with this car.	1
	there are two things here that can not be correct.	1
	#1, when you actually order this car through hyundai's dcs order system, you only get one option package.	1
	you have to choose pkg, 1,2,3, or 4. you can not pick more than one.	1
	second, on the pricing guide, it clearly states that as you move up the option ladder that each successive package requires the previous package.	1
	point is , you could not get a tech package without the wheels or the moonroof.	1
	now, as i said before, my district rep told me that a v6 with tech would be $37000.	1
	he said that you do not have to pay for each package like they are listed.	1
	such as $2000+$1000+$4000, which would make the car $40000.	1
	i ordered a car like this and thought that it would be $37000 when i did.	1
	now, if my guy is wrong, then so am i, so i am sorry in advance if what i am telling you is wrong.	1
	the v8 cars should be here in late august or september.	1
	it is usually a 2.5-3 month turnaround from the time you take a car until it hits your lot.	1
	we ordered our v8 car a week or two ago.	1
	i get to drive the car in 5 days!!	1
	!                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1782#msg1782it's still confusing        i think we'll need to wait until an actual car is delivered with pricing on the sticker.	1
	it could be either way.	1
	the fact that you can only enter one package really doesn't mean anything.	1
	if all previous packages are dependent upon the latter, the system could just 'automatically' put the packages in.	1
	for example, if you enter the technology package for $4000, the system could automatically put in the other packages -- $2000 + $1000.	1
	that's why it's only necessary to enter one package.	1
	other reasons why i doubt that the $4000 package includes the other packages  of $2000 and $1000 in that price is that the technology upgrades certainly are worth much more than $1000.	1
	and if you look at the v8 model where only the tech package is offered (because the 38k starting price includes the other packages as 'standard'), it is a full $4000.	1
	why would the tech package for the v6 be $1000 and for the v8 be $4000?	1
	it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.	1
	i'd be very pleasantly surprised if the $4000 package includes all other packages in that price.	1
	that would make the final price 37k instead of 40k.	1
	it would also make the price differential between the v6 and the v8 at 5k -- which is a lot considering the performance difference is probably not very much.	1
	if i were betting on it, i'd have to think that the $4000 tech package does not include the other packages at that price point.	1
	i think the retail price when all packages are added will be close to 40k, not 37k.	1
	we'll see.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1783#msg1783re: it's still confusing [ricwhite]        hyundainews.com says it comes with the premium package.	1
	hyundainews is the official media website for hyundai.	1
	also the tech package bypasses the premium package.	1
	it upgrades some of the premium package features and adds the tech features.	1
	also by adding the premium plus on the v6 it would be a better deal.	1
	hope this helps.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1785#msg1785re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]         i get to drive the car in 5 days!!!	1
	does this mean that you are going to have cars hitting the lot in less than a week?	1
	or do you have a special dealer only event you are going to where you will get to drive the car?	1
	i am also concerned that you only ordered one car with the v8.	1
	my local dealer sells up to 500 new hyundai's a month.	1
	to only order one v8, i dont understand.	1
	do you expect that no one will be willing to pay the $40k+ for it?	1
	it is at least $10k less than anything comparable.	1
	i would think you could sell at least one a day.	1
	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1786#msg1786re: change the subject (slightly) [tom17]        hey tom.	1
	well, i'll try to answer all of that.	1
	no, i will not have cars on the lot next week, and so yes, i will be going to a dealer-only event to see and drive the car.	1
	now if your local dealer is selling up to 500 new hyundais a month then i would assume you are in new york or las vegas.	1
	if i was planet hyundai or atlantic hyundai (two of the best candidates for your 500+ club) i would be taking several more of the cars for sure.	1
	however, even as the largest volume dealer in my three state area, i am still selling mostly sonata's, elantra's, and santa fe's.	1
	i just really don't want to pay the floorplan interest on a $40k car if it sits here for 400 days.	1
	i agree that the $10k savings on this car is awesome.	1
	also, if the car is as quiet and smooth as we hear, the cost difference may just be icing on the cake.	1
	however, after we stocked 20-25 xg300's when they first hit the ground and then watching the azera flounder on our lot, we are simply choosing to be a little careful.	1
	lastly, i only had one or two v8's allocated to me, so even if i wanted more, i would have been out of luck.	1
	also, if we have demand for the car the says that we need to have a large inventory, then believe me, we'll get it as quickly as possible!	1

	***************                that's the point i'm making.	1
	if people balked at paying up for a luxury azera, why would they pay $40k for a genesis with no history of being an outstanding car they just have to have with no 'look at me badge' on the hood?	1
	looks like another flounder in the making to me.	1
	i think the genesis v-6 coupe will sell much better if it's priced right, and the car mags don't trash it too bad when they check it out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1788#msg1788special order        i wonder if it is at all possible to special order the car with the genesis wing badge instead of the 'h'..??	1
	i would'nt mind waiting for it to be made just for that reason.	1
	otherwise i hope hyundai corp is reading this and i'm sure everyone agrees that this car should be badged with a genesis wing like the kdm and make it standard around model 2010 or 2011...        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1790#msg1790re: change the subject (slightly) [gccmn]        $30k was based on the 3.3l v6, which the trim hyundai motor america didn't want, i believe.	1
	also, under 30k creates too much of an overlap with the azera, which could cause cannibalization.	1
	the other reason, almost for certain, the weak dollars - car prices have gone up across the board.	1
	$37k is the price of a well-appointed/loaded v6 version.	1
	v6 starts at $33k (msrp), with freight included - very well-equipped already, imo.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1795#msg1795re: change the subject (slightly) [gary045]        well, this is about the 1,458th time that i've had this conversation with my salespeople, my general manager, my wife, my goldfish (okay, so i don't have fish).	1
	there is one huge difference between the azera and the genesis that i think could make this car sell better.	1
	the genesis actually has a number of things about it that make people (real car people) excited about seeing and driving it.	1
	this car has a 375 horse v8.	1
	it is rear wheel drive.	1
	this car has a real luxury interior, not a close-to-lux interior.	1
	this car has almost all of the luxury tech that one wants to want (nav, auto headlights, hid's, etc.).	1
	edmunds says that this car is one of the quietest that they have ever tested.	1
	when you have people really excited about a car then it becomes something that they want, not something that we have to sell them.	1
	seriouosly, don't most of us that are in the market for a 4 door sedan want a powerful (yet still fuel efficient) engine, a responsive tranny, a high grade interior, a quiet ride, and lots of fun buttons to push?	1
	when you take out an azera for a test drive, you are selling it on being a good car, that is almost as good as it's competitors at a slightly lesser price.	1
	i feel like i can sell a genesis because it is equal to it's competitors (or better, from what i read thus far) and is tens of thousands of dollars less.	1
	with all of that said, i still think that exercising some caution is warranted.	1
	let's be real, our economy isn't exactly thriving right now.	1
	anything higher in price makes people a little nervous.	1
	now, there may be lots of folks that are smart and see that this is a great deal, but to take a line from men in black, 'a person is smart, people are dumb' or something like that.	1
	i need to see that a large number of people are really going to plunk down $33k-$42k on a hyundai car before i order a bunch of them regardless of how good of a deal the car really is.	1
	what can i say, i'm a realist.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1796#msg1796the real test        the real test will be after the 'honeymoon phase' is over and the genesis settles into the marketplace.	1
	i'd like to see about a year from now how the hype of the genesis manifests itself in the real world.	1
	i remember all of the hype surrounding the azera.	1
	it certainly is a nice car.	1
	i've had mine now for 2.5 years.	1
	but it's about as common as an elephant on the freeway.	1
	in fact, i have only seen one other azera on the road in the last 2.5 years and i live in large metro-city area.	1
	i certainly think the genesis will spark a lot of interest initially.	1
	in fact, they may be short supply.	1
	the azera was in really short supply as well at first.	1
	in fact i had to travel to a different city to buy my azera.	1
	but now the azera is pretty much forgotten and it's such a weak force in the marketplace that its competitors have absolutely nothing to worry about.	1
	in fact, they laugh at the azera.	1
	once things settle down, will the genesis just turn into another azera?	1
	will it be pretty much forgotten a year or so from now?	1
	will its competition actually be worried some or will they be laughing at the genesis just like they do with the azera?       	1

	but the resale value still lags.	1
	i'd think by now that should improve.	1
	but i think hyundia is getting ahead of themselves jumping from the azera to now the genesis luxury segment.	1
	in the $40k+ area people are more concerned about the proven brand or badge, and want to show up at work or the cookout in something they can be proud of and will evoke envy.	1
	and not spending their time trying to explain to people why they spent $40k on a hyundai...lol  defending hyundai's progress and feeling shame is not what these people are about.	1

	disagreed 100%.	1
	you know what's going on right now with the economy?	1
	in fact, the whole large car class is in the sh*t hole.	1
	for example, avalon has only sold a little over 21k units all told through may 2008, some 34% off the pace from same period last year; while the azera is only off by about 10%.	1
	put it in another way, last year, for every azera sold, toyota sold four-to-five avalons; ytd 2008, that ratio has gone down to almost 2:1.                                just because you don't see many (or any) in your area, doesn't mean same thing everywhere else...       	1

	genesis?	1
	i wouldn't compare azera to just the avalon                                yes, all sales are down now because of the economy, but that actually should boost hyundai sales over competitors since consumers get more bang for their buck.	1
	actually several models in the hyundai line have seen sales increases.	1
	but azera, even in the hyundai line, is a rather minor vehicle.	1
	azera sales from january-march, 2008 show 5,706 sold.	1
	sales for the same period show sonata sales of 24,431 and electra sales of 23,870.  the santa fe sales were 17,691.   even the lowly accent sold 10,214 and the tucson sold 6,013.  no wonder why hyundai really doesn't advertise or push the azera.	1
	it is a 'minor' vehicle in their line-up.	1
	and if you look back to 2007 and 2006, the azera average sales were actually lower than in 2008.                                so, azera has never been a 'force' in the marketplace.	1
	the weakening economy might actually help azera because of its value and the weakening sales competitors in that class, but that still won't bring azera up to their level.	1
	timing for the genesis might also be a problem.	1
	the economy is poor.	1
	introducing a large car in the marketplace at a time when consumers are looking to downsize and conserve can be a problem.	1
	it may not be the best time to introduce a car with a v8 engine producing close to 400 horsepower.	1
	the weakening dollar will actually raise the price of the genesis.	1
	what it looks like to me is that the genesis might go the way of the azera.	1
	i'm sure it will be in short supply initially, but, over time when things settle, i doubt we'll see sales figures over 2-3 thousand per month.	1
	i think what would really help to boost sales of the genesis, is if they came up with a genesis hybrid or something inventive such as a genesis ng (natural gas).	1
	the car would retain the great features and performance, but also be much cleaner and economical for a great price.	1
	that would be hot in our current marketplace.       	1

	.	1
	.	1
	genesis?	1
	[ricwhite]        you seem surprised by the fact the higher-priced azera sold less than lower-priced products in the fleet...                                 and if you look back to 2007 and 2006, the azera average sales were actually lower than in 2008.                                so have almost everyone in the large sedan class.	1
	like i said, the azera is doing okay without much media exposure - as per my example previously, the azera is actually staying close to its pace from last year (about 10% off); that cannot be said for some others in the class (i.e.	1
	avalon off about 34%).	1
	it makes little sense to compare the azera to the sales of other hyundai products.	1
	to come from another angle, let me compare the avalon to other products in the toyota line (i.e.	1
	camry), and with that, man, avalon sales just tanked...doesn't make much sense, does it?	1
	that is why i used the avalon as an example, instead something like the accent.	1
	i doubt we'll see sales figures over 2-3 thousand per month.	1
	well, neither do i, especially considering hyundai only estimated 20k for all export markets in 08 (partial year), which the us is one of those markets.	1
	fwiw, the average mid-to-large luxury sedan does not sell in large quantities, period.	1
	the genesis family (sedan and coupe) is not out to be the king of sales, but moreso to improve the brand, to create an emphasis on the brand, and to bring the intanibles to the rest of the line.	1
	this is not a product for the beancounters, neither is the azera, for the matter.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1806#msg1806poor timing        timing is  a difficult thing for manufacturers - look at what ford and  gm are having to do with their new version pick-ups and suv's.	1
	with the recession, low value dollar and high gas prices, it is not a good time to introduce a v8 in a heavy car that will probably have poor mpg.	1
	personally i think hyundai should put more into really bringing the azera up to where it is supposed to be so that it will be competitive with avalon, top honda accord, maxima and so forth.	1
	most people in the $35,000+ field are looking for a badge as much as anything else.	1
	no matter how good the genesis is, when you park it next to an acura, infiniti, lexus, bmw, mb, etc., you just want feel the same.	1
	hyundai needs to establish a minimum five year across the board for all models excellent reliability before a $35,000+ car will appeal to most people, if they can get the badge people to buy it at all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1807#msg1807re: poor timing [carolinabob]         will probably have poor mpg                                except that's not true.	1
	17/25 is very respectable for a v8 375hp car that weighs almost 2 ton.	1
	personally i think hyundai should put more into really bringing the azera up to where it is supposed to be so that it will be competitive with avalon, top honda accord, maxima and so forth.	1
	i don't agree.	1
	i firmly believe the azera is on par with the competition.	1
	the owners i have spoken to seem to agree; ditto from the industry professionals.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1808#msg1808hyundai vs. genesis        i have to concur here with regard to the questionable prospects of the genesis badged hyundai.	1
	my other thoughts are that i think although hyundai has set u.s. sales target of 30k units, realistically, we may only see sales in the low teens.	1
	that would still be considerably better though than single digits, however.	1
	one of the main sticking points that i have had since the decision by hyundai to remove the genesis branding from their premium vehicle is that it undervalued the vehicle from a marketing standpoint.	1
	given the fact that they opted not to develop a separate brand channel, they handicapped this car further by neglecting to establish this car with its own brand identity, resulting in a car possessing zero brand cachet.	1
	of course they couldve housed the genesis under the h umbrella temporarily while they carefully gauged its growth, market acceptance and still benefit from the carry over halo effect within the hyundai value brand.	1
	yet, we all know the rationale hyundai has given or is it tried to justify(?)	1
	as to why they left the hyundai logo on the rear deck lid and stripped off any identity for this car on the front hood.	1
	regardless of how genuinely well made this vehicle is, i can't help but agree with all who have voiced concern about the lack of cachet that seemingly undermines this car.	1
	the genesis brand would have been an excellent 'trophy' car brand, especially for american consumers in the demographic target group that hyundai plans to market.	1
	in my opinion, the genesis prospects wouldve been greatly improved and had a wider appeal to this group but instead, hyundai may have squandered their u.s. launch by going against the grain, fighting the natural laws of branding and marketing because group think egos at hyundai corporate said, 'lets promote the hyundai brand ahead of making this a premium, car called genesis'.	1
	their desire to push and grow sales in the u.s. market is  their single minded overriding objective which may explain why it has clouded their sound business sense by allowing them to succumb to against the grain thinking.	1
	regardless of what hyundai says, i believe they have made a magnificent blunder by not retaining the genesis brand/logo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1809#msg1809what is considered doing well?	1
	joe,                                i guess we'll need to agree to disagree whether the azera is doing well compared with the avalon and other vehicles in that class and whether or not the genesis will do well.	1
	we can all interpret the figures differently.	1
	when i look at the figures and see that the hyundai azera might sell                 15,000                or so vehicles per year.	1
	i see that the toyota sold                 66,905                avalons in 2006 and                 54,560                in 2007.  in 2008, it looks like they're down by 30% or so which might bring them down to                 36,000                or so avalons this year.	1
	toyota sold                 365,140                camrys in 2007.;  you say, that azera is competing with the avalon quite well.	1
	i say it's doing rather poorly.	1
	i guess we see things differently.	1
	my point with the genesis is that i really don't expect the genesis to do any better against its competition than the azera is doing.	1
	even with its lower price point, i don't expect it to sell nearly as well as bmw or lexus, or mercedes, etc.	1
	i think the whole luxury market is depressed and the genesis enters at a very unfortunate time.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1811#msg1811re: hyundai vs. genesis [carbunt]        maybe one big reason hyundai didn't stick the genesis brand on their new flagship sedan is because genesis as a brand has almost no value or recognition.	1
	the hyundai brand has very good value, and broad recognition worldwide.	1
	did you know, for example, that the hyundai brand is ranked 8th overall in value amongst automakers--ahead of brands such as nissan... porsche... and (!)	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1812#msg1812re: what is considered doing well?	1
	[ricwhite]        come on, the math is not that hard to figure out - as close as last year, toyota was selling somewhere in the range of 4-5 avalons for every azera sold; so far this year, that ratio has come down to around 2 avalons for every azera.	1
	let's also not forget the avalon is well-established, vs. the azera being a new product entry, new name, etc.	1
	yes, the azera sales aren't blowing anyone's socks off; yes, the numbers could be better, but let's not make it sound like no one is buying the azera...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1813#msg1813re: hyundai vs. genesis [carbunt]         questionable prospects of the genesis badged hyundai.	1
	that's all speculative.	1
	fwiw, hyundai has reported the cost of setting up a new marque and everything that comes with it (i.e.	1
	dealer network).	1
	i don't remember the exact number but hyundai had estimated somewhere in the double digit in years just to breakeven from the upfront costs.	1
	i actually don't have a problem with it badging as a hyundai.	1
	i see it as a win-win -  the product itself is a winner, as well as the intangible benefits to the brand and the other line in the fleet.	1
	we'd have never known how a luxury marque would perform, but the outlook in current situation looks very good for the improvements of the hyundai brand, it may also work as the better scenario long term.	1
	hyundai has set u.s. sales target of 30k units                                this year hyundai korea has set a sales target of 20k for all export markets, us being one of them (partial year).	1
	i think they would need to re-assess the market condition for next year before releasing a fair estimate.       	1

	he also hates the high speed stability, braking and transmission.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1828#msg1828re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [rotary]        i've seen this video before and it is the korean version genesis equipped 3.3 powerplant.	1
	we are getting the 3.8 v6  4.6 v8 powerplants.	1
	aside from this video, have you read the first drive report here on edmunds?	1
	or some others like autoblog?	1
	motor trend, car  driver?	1

	bottom line, the genesis can compete.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1829#msg1829re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [rotary]        considering i am in the us, naturally, i would be more intrigued to hear and test drive the north american version, which has upgraded suspension for the market and other changes.	1
	but, just a few quick items on this:                                the reviewer pointed out a few things which made little or no sense:                                1) vdc                2) braking                3) handling/dynamics felt like a ff sedan - what?????	1
	a friend told me the review company is related to samsung, which is a competitor of hyundai in the korean market - go figure...                                anyway, what's more interesting:                                the same korean spec car was tested by the us journalists, and none of them reported anything close to what this dude was talking about - all of the us journalists had different conclusions than this guy.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1830#msg1830re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [joe97]        i hope you're right.	1
	i want the genesis to succeed more than any other car in hyundai's lineup.	1
	why?	1
	because i'd absolutely love to see someone kneecap both bmw and mercedes (okay, even lexus) for charging ridiculous premiums for cars that don't warrant it.	1
	do you know what the new s550 is selling for?	1
	as much as 110k, fully loaded.	1
	a bmw 7 series is selling for 80k+.	1
	heck, even the ls430, lexus' flagship sedan, is arguably massively overpriced at 75k.	1
	the lexus es 330 is just an insulation stuffed, more richly trimmed camry, yet toyota gets as much as 11k more for it than the v6 camry.	1
	so, i want the genesis to succeed.	1
	my fear is that they cut corners on some important parts and components, in order to be able to load the car up with expensive content on the interior, and that the driving dynamics of the car will suffer as a result.	1
	like i said, i plan on taking a genesis for a very long test drive when they arrive at local dealers.	1
	i am not about to pay anywhere near 30k for a hyundai at this point in time unless i am very confident that warts will not show up in the way the car handles, drives or feels after the initial honeymoon warmth is over.	1
	as i consider a sedan for the first time in a long time, i am considering a pontiac g8, an infinity g37, and possibly, the genesis.	1
	i know that's a divergent mix.	1
	i suspect the pontiac will be the tautest, the infinity will blend comfort and sport nicely, and i am anxiously awaiting the genesis test.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1831#msg1831re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [rotary]        do you suppose hyundai wants genesis to succeed.. maybe even more than you do?	1
	do you think they may actually see it as being crucial to their future in the u.s.?	1
	do you suppose they are smart enough to realize what the risk is of cutting corners on important parts and components?	1
	have you read the reviews from c/d et.	1
	al.	1
	that discuss the care to which hyundai designed the suspension, the new tau engine, the interior (over-engineered for quietness)?	1
	do you have the same concerns about the g8?	1

	number minus-one from a first-year batch of 30,000 pontiac g8s just crawled out of its shell.	1
	that is, the first pontiac g8  an engineering prototype not among the first production models  rolled off a holden assembly line in the south australian town of elizabeth.	1
	essentially, the g8 is a re-skinned holden commodore ve,                   which has collected reviews in several shades of awesome.	1
	to recap: a few months back, the general, spooked by the prospect of rising cafe standards, said it had 'pressed the pause button' on its rear-wheel-drive plans.	1
	then, whoops, it pressed play again.	1
	back on track, the g8 is the first american domestic market vehicle built off gm's rwd platform known as zeta.	1
	(the camaro will likely be #2.)	1
	a nearly 400 horsepower (391 hp) 6.0-liter v8, along with and six-speed manual, will be standard fare on the gt model.	1

	the reviews can say whatever they want to, but you may like the car, you may not like the car.	1
	it's that simple.	1
	by the way, lexus no longer sells the ls430 as a new car, ditto on the es330, but you can find good deals on the used lots.	1
	also, infiniti has released the g37 sedan for the european market but not yet here in the states, stay tuned though                                i opted out of the g8 upon seeing the list of features/equipment, although the car drove pretty nice; the g35 sedan is a bit smaller for my likes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1834#msg1834re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [rotary]        i'm sure backy knows the g8 is just a rebadged holden commodore with 90% of the features/equipment                                that said, backy was talking about the magnitude of the genesis, as compared to the g8.	1
	the genesis means just that much more to hyundai than the g8 to gm.	1
	by the way, the article posted is obviously outdated - the 6.0l v8 in the pontiac g8 gt puts out 361hp (not 390), and no 6-sd manal option, much less as standard equipment...                                comparison at-a-glance:                                genesis 3.8l v6 - 290hp 6spd aisin a/t 18/27 mpg                g8 3.6l v6 - 256hp 5spd a/t 17/25 mpg                                geneis 4.6l v8 - 375hp/368hp 6spd zf a/t 17/25 mpg                g8 gt 6.0l v8 - 361hp 6spd a/t 15/24 mpg (                 with cyclinder deactivation                )                                the genesis v8 gets exact mileage figures as g8 v6, with an extra 119hp, or 112hp on regular...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1835#msg1835horsepower (joe)        joe, i agree that hyundai is getting great mileage and power (based on its displacement) from the 4.6l v8.	1
	i also agree that the g35 is too tight in front and back.	1
	what have the lexus ls430 and es330 become?	1
	i haven't been keeping up with lexus (obviously) because their pricing turned me off a long time ago - they are way overpriced for what you get, imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1836#msg1836re: horsepower (joe) [rotary]         what have the lexus ls430 and es330 become?	1
	the es is now the es350 with the 2gr toyota motor and the ls is now the ls460.	1
	essentially the same models, just redesigned with updated engines.	1
	btw the hybrid ls will tip 100k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1837#msg1837re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [backy]         do you have the same concerns about the g8?	1
	do you think gm has a better chance of executing on the g8 than hyundai has with the genesis?	1
	well, though these vehicles are so much alike, they are more different (obviously).	1
	yes, the g8 does want to be a poor 5 series fighter ( and it succeeds), while the genesis almost squarely competes with lower end midsize japanese lux models, so the two have somewhat of a comon interest.	1
	but the goals are different, as pontiac is going for performance and h        yundai, luxury.	1
	and though the genesis has more horsepower, the g8 is much quicker.	1
	although the two are the same size with rwd, i don't realy think they can be considered in the same market.	1
	as for those who say the g8 falls short, consider gm put forth a lot less effort than hyundai for this vehicle.	1
	hyundai has a lot more riding on this.	1
	gm probably didn't want to put forth too much of an effort because pontiac was, and is being considered for termination (athough they would be idiots to get rid of pontiac before hummer and saab).	1
	if gm put forward half the effort that hyundai did, the g8 would be just as nice, if not nicer.	1
	they probably will, but in the form of a buick.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1838#msg1838re: horsepower (joe) [tjc78]         essentially the same models, just redesigned with updated engines.	1
	what?	1
	no.	1
	the ls460 is a whole new redesign with a brand new engine, brand new platform, brand new exterior and brand new interior.	1
	there are virtually no relation between it and the old ls430 except for the ls designation.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1839#msg1839re: horsepower (joe) [louiswei]        of course i know that!	1

	no different than a redesigned camry/avalon/whatever.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1841#msg1841re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [rotary]        i like this post.	1
	my past two cars were a bmw 528i and an infiniti m45.	1
	i'm very eager to test drive the genesis.	1
	i'm somewhat unique in that i love the benefits of nice cars, but i don't care much about the prestige.	1
	i like a quiet, comfortable drive, a great stereo, extra power when i need it, and that's about it.	1
	the great handling of the bmw is nice, but rarely used and bmw's are absurdly overpriced.	1
	the infiniti is perfect in almost every way, so that's what i'm going to get if the genesis falls short in some way.	1
	the only concern i have about the genesis image issue is that i'm not looking forward to explaining why i chose a hyundai to my friends and acquaintences.	1
	unfortunately, it's a reality that buyers of audi, mercedes, lexus, bmw, infiniti, cadillac, etc.	1
	will see a hyundai as cheap and common.	1
	the only way to overcome such images is to put out a high quality product and keep doing it for years.	1
	lexus did it beautifully, infiniti is still the process imho, and acura had it, but seems to have lost it a little.	1
	if the genesis is as incredible as it sounds, they will steal a few buyers like me from the lux-manufacturers and a few who want to step up from camry, sonata, accord.	1
	if the car is great, they will carve out a niche.	1
	i am concerned about my timing.	1
	i have to make a purchase by october 1 so that won't leave enough time for the v8 genesis to satisfy the initial demand surge and then settle into a longer term trend.	1
	i'm a little worried that this model could go the way of the vw phaeton, which i almost bought as well.	1
	hyundai seems to be a very serious competitor, however, and i suspect that they will support the genesis through any turbulent times.	1
	the product launch does seem to be pretty choppy, however.	1
	there is just way too little information out there.	1
	most of the reviews i've found are based upon a preview in korea last january or a car show where they just sat in it.	1
	i'm waiting for the big magazines to do a thorough review of the u.s. model that will actually be for sale.	1
	i guess that those reviews will be coming in the next month or two and that hyundai will greatly intensify their marketing at that point.	1
	one other point about the korean car review that was kind of lukewarm.	1
	i have read in several reviews that the korean model that he tested has a much softer suspension.	1
	the cars for export to the us will be firmed up in several ways, which should help a lot.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1843#msg1843re: prominent korean reviewer: not so impressed with genesis [pat2717]        hey pat2717, there's really a couple of easy answers you can give to anyone when they ask why you would choose a *gasp* hyundai over something prestigous.	1
	#1) you don't have to use premium gas in the tank.	1
	#2)  the amount of money you saved yourself in what it would take to get one of those prestigous cars optioned  equipped comparably to the genesis (a minimum of $15k).	1
	the last answer you can give (my personal favorite and the one i give), 'because it's what i chose to get.	1
	now if you want to pay the note for me...i'll get whatever car you want to put me in.'	1
	lol                                the strongest argument right now is whether or not the genesis can compete with the likes of the infinity m, 5-series or e-class vehicles.	1
	personally, i don't think that is the true arguement.	1
	if you look at what you pay for the car and how close it may come to providing what the prestigous makes give you...that says a lot.	1
	i truly don't feel that one will get the exact performance of any of the mid-level premium cars.	1
	i think you'll get some semblance, but not dead on.	1
	the real question is...does the money saved justify overlooking the fact that it doesn't provide the driving dymanics of a bmw, benz or infinity?	1
	are there other aspects of the vehicle that make up for what it may lack?	1
	i will agree, hyundai did hurt themselves by putting it out there that they benchmarked benz  bmw when it came to putting the genesis together.	1
	that really set the expectation bar really high.	1
	personally, i hope that bar is met or at least they get close enough as to not take a serious hit.	1
	the biggest thing right now is the rampant speculation, like you said...needs to be handled by a serious review by a few respected magazines and car folks.	1
	i hate to say it...hyundai has succeeded in generating a serious buzz and hype over this car.	1
	i would almost say a buzz that rivaled that of the pontiac soltice/saturn sky.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1844#msg1844re: hyundai still has to prove itself [joe97]        there is a geneis coupe forum/thread - fyi                                a friend of mine has a 6 speed tib - very much a fun car.	1

	they want to be 'in all markets' like all car makers, not just cheap cars.....                                hyundia moved up in sales because of the effort they put into quality, the warranty, and under pricing other car makers to get people to buy their cars after making junk before new leadership came on board.	1
	all done by providing a low cost high value economy cars in emerging countries.	1

	hyundais main gains have been its double digit sales increases in the chinese, indian and russian markets whilst still finding more new customers in the crowded, mature markets of north american, europe and australia.	1
	the steady climb up the charts is attributable to the leadership and vision of chairman chung mong-koo.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1850#msg1850genesis tour        here is something interesting:                                 link title                                hyundai is taking their new genesis across the country and letting people come and test drive it.	1
	sounds great to do before the cars hit the dealerships, but why would someone want to drive 100-300 miles to test drive a car they can see at their local dealership?	1
	the tour is scheduled to run into october.	1
	would be great if they had some of the competition (m35/45, 528/535, gs350) present to drive back to back, but i really doubt that will happen.	1
	fyi.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1851#msg1851re: genesis tour [tom17]         the 'discover genesis' grassroots program is a 15-city tour that started this month, and hits luxury markets.	1
	hyundai says it includes a stop at the pebble beach concours d'elegance and ends in october at the autobahn country club.	1
	consumers will be able to test-drive and compare genesis to competitive vehicles.         	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1852#msg1852re: change the subject (slightly) [jeffreid]        i noticed on the great lakes hyundai web site they show the v6 with tech pkg at a msrp of $40k.	1
	that would indicate the prerequisite package dollars are indeed added into the msrp.	1
	if this is accurate, then the price with tech pkg is not 37k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1853#msg1853re: genesis tour [joe97]        i'm in atlanta, by the time their tour is here, i've either bought the car or went with something else.	1
	shouldn't the tour have taken place prior to the launch.	1
	imo, this is stupid!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1854#msg1854re: genesis tour [bigelm]        wouldn't that defeat the whole point of a tour?	1
	you may be thinking about sneak preview - which has happened already.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1855#msg1855it is here.	1
	i overheard that there is a v8 genesis at roseville hyundai in california available to view and test drive.	1
	if anyone close by that location, check it out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1856#msg1856re: genesis tour [joe97]        unless if their target is to entice more customers then i can see the point of this.	1
	i guess my mindset is more of the 'once i've made up my mind, it doesn't matter'.	1
	hahha!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1857#msg1857driving impressions plus some extra info        good morning.	1
	well, as i had mentioned previously, i got to drive the genesis on the 24th.	1
	i thought that i would report my findings and i also have some new info that i got today that i wanted to pass along.	1
	brief overview- i only got to drive the v6.	1
	the car is not a perfect '10' (in my opinion), but it is really good.	1
	more details below.	1
	okay, so like i said, i got to drive the v6 version only.	1
	the only v8 at the event that i attended was parked inside in a room with a e350 and a lexus gs.	1
	i'm not sure which engine the lexus had.	1
	now, i want to make a distinction about the driving on this car.	1
	this is a car that has almost no body roll and it changes directions pretty well, however, it is not the corner-carving bmw fighter that hyundai asked for.	1
	i was pretty impressed while driving the car, and since i was driving a $37000 car, it was outstanding, it just wasn't the equal of a 5-series.	1
	one other thing on handling.	1
	i tried my best to lose the back end on this car.	1
	i never got close.	1
	one time i got the front tires to bark while going around a curve, but i was going into the curve with the throttle floored and then straight onto the brake while turning hard.	1
	i never felt as though the car was out of control whatsoever.	1
	also, the interior of the car is actually quieter that i had expected.	1
	this was just amazing.	1
	the outside world was almost nonexistent.	1
	i heard a few sounds when we went over some tire pieces laid out on the ground to simulate expansion joints, but even this was muted very well.	1
	oh, and by the way, this car was preproduction with no sound deadening in the doors!!	1
	the engine is completely silent and there was zero wind noise.	1
	braking is outstanding.	1
	some of the best i have ever seen in a car of this type.	1
	my only complaint on driving was that the car weighs 3700 pounds and as such takes a moment to change directions.	1
	also, i felt like the low end response was a little slow.	1
	now again, this was the v6, and it was still decent, but just not a world beater.	1
	bottom line on driving.	1
	super quiet, fairly solid acceleration with v6 (assume that the v8 will rip!!	1
	), outstanding braking, pretty good handling with zero body roll.	1
	always feels composed.	1
	on to the interior.	1
	the first thing that i noticed was how well done the leather is.	1
	if you are trying to compare this interior in your mind with any other hyundai you have seen, well, just quit.	1
	the lexus gs that i sat in was pretty similar.	1
	i was very pleased with the seat design.	1
	also, there is a ton of room in this car.	1
	the reviewers are telling the truth about the back seat.	1
	room for days.	1
	the dis (i-drive) seems pretty intuitive.	1
	i played with it for a while after i drove the car and i think that after a couple of days of owning the car that one would have the hang of it.	1
	the sound system rocked.	1
	the one that i was playing with was the top end system.	1
	now, i do have a couple of gripes on the interior.	1
	the driver's seat being the only one that is cooled is stupid.	1
	i know this has been covered, but good grief!!	1
	also, the foot pedals are not power adjustable.	1
	why not?	1
	next, no power folding exterior mirrors.	1
	uh, hello?	1
	finally, a four way power passenger seat?	1
	how much does the extra functions really cost?	1
	on a positive note, there is a trunk release on the outside just like the azera.	1
	no need for an aftermarket kit afterall.	1
	interior final thoughts-- lots of room, very good fit and finish, most of the right buttons, completely on par (and better in may ways)  with the e350 and gs that i sat in.	1
	oh yeah, on the outside this thing is sharp!!	1
	better than in the pictures for sure.	1
	alright, a few other notes.	1
	i was told two things on pricing.	1
	1. the v6 tech pkg should be $37000, not $40000.	1
	2. expect a price jump in as little as 6 months.	1
	also, the cars should be on the lot in 7-10 days.	1
	and lastly.........drum roll please........ the south central region announced promo apr rates on the genesis.	1
	i was pretty shocked.	1
	anyway for 24-48mths there is 0.9%-6.9% for tiers 1-4. on 49-60mths there is 1.90%-6.9% for tiers 1-4. on 61-72mths there is 3.90%-8.50% for tiers 1-4. the credit tiers are based on a bunch of stuff, score, history, whatever.	1
	but hey, these make a bargain even more of a bargain.	1
	final thoughts.	1
	well, the car isn't spot on 'perfect'.	1
	however, for the price delta that i saw ($17k on a v6 genesis to an e350) i think that this thing is an absolute steal.	1
	my wife, an avid m-b fan, even admitted that this thing was really 'hot'.	1
	the car drives great, it looks good, and the interior is excellent.	1
	if you can overlook the few little omissions on the feature list, you will smile every time you start your car!	1
	!                                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1858#msg1858re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        jeffreid...thank you for the posting, finally something from someone that frequents this forum.	1
	even with your assessment of the genesis not meeting the driving dynmaics of a 5-series, do you feel that the overall car itself has qualities that would make one overlook that aspect?	1
	another question, in your opinion, overall do you feel that the car meets, exceeds or underachieves for it's price point?	1
	from what i got out of your posting, the car definitely exceeds, but i'd rather hear it from you as opposed to assuming.	1
	if that is the case,                                i think if enough folks complain about the little things that were left out (power folding mirrors, power pedals, cooled passenger seat, etc), i can see those as being upgrades for next year's genesis.	1
	at least i would hope that is the case.	1
	again, thanks for the posting, very, very informative!!!	1
	p.s.	1
	on a scale of 1-10 (knowing you didn't give it a 10) how would you rate the car itself; and separately...how would you rate your initial experience with the car on the same scale?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1859#msg1859re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        nobody wants 'perfect car' for mid-30k dollars.	1
	thanks for your informative post.	1
	and.. this is one little question i have.	1
	how do you feel about the suspensions of the genesis.	1
	we heard that us version of genesis would get stiffer suspensions than korea domestic version has.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1860#msg1860re: driving impressions plus some extra info [allthatblue]        allthatblue...no disrespect, but 'perfect' could be a subjective quality.	1
	to someone that's driven the likes of a bmw, benz, lexus or infinity...a genesis may not be perfect.	1
	however, someone that's used to the likes of ford, honda, toyota, chevy...could very well feel that it is a perfect car for them.	1
	there is no truly perfect car, just some being better than others.	1
	take for instance...the azera, while being far from a perfect car, it has been the perfect car for me.	1
	the genesis, while it could very well be a much better car than the azera, doesn't necessarily make it the perfect car for me (at least at this time                ).	1
	i guess one way it could be looked at is...while not being a perfect 10 (as per jeffreid's earlier assessment), the genesis could very well be the best offering for the money.	1
	while not being spot-on in terms of driving dynamics as compared to a bmw, is it close enough that it's seen as overachieving for a $35k, near 2-ton car?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1861#msg1861re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        great review, thanks.	1
	as far as your gripes, i can live without the power foot pedals and folding mirrors.	1
	the 4-way passenger seat is a disappointment.	1
	will the v8 be limited to 4-way as well?	1
	in the real world it probably does not make that much of a difference but it does cheapen the car or at least your perception of the car.	1
	i think once you get above 35k you have to go with at least an 8-way passenger seat.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1862#msg1862re: driving impressions plus some extra info [allmet33]        now that is what i call a reply!!!	1
	now to answer the questions that you have posed.	1
	i  think that overall most people are not going to drive this car, or the 5-series, or any of the other cars in this set like i drove on tuesday.	1
	i was in a test car that i did not own and wanted to try and find something to bi**h about in the driving dynamics.	1
	with that being said, the car performed extremely well.	1
	i was doing my best to lose the back tires and never got close.	1
	the car always felt very balanced and composed.	1
	i just didn't feel like it was 'on rails'.	1
	now as far as taking price into account when comparing the driving, you change things considerably.	1
	i am going to have to agree with the edmunds reviewer in that, for the price, this thing may be in a league of its own.	1
	the quiet interior, the balanced and composed handling, and the overall feel of a substantive automobile made me think that this car is just an absolute steal!!	1
	i surely say that the genesis exceeds it's $37000 without breaking a sweat.	1
	as far as the little extras that were not available on the car go, hyundai did something that i've never seen before.	1
	all through the session, there was a form that we were to fill out that asked for what things we thought were right and what things needed to be changed.	1
	i was told that hma would be reviewing these forms and trying to make the changes that are needed.	1
	i used a lot of exclamation points on the features that should be in any 'luxury' car.	1
	they used that phrase to the point that my ears were about to bleed.	1
	now, to rate the car.	1
	i want to say two things in this rating.	1
	in comparison to the cars hyundai says it wants to compete with (e-class, gs, 5-series) i can easily rate the car at a 8.5-9.0 without any talk of price.	1
	if you knew me personally, you would appreciate how hard it is for me to rate any auto from hyundai that highly against that type of competitor.	1
	with that being said, i think that this car is that good.	1
	now, if you give me the huge price advantage then i can't help but move this car into the 9.5 range.	1
	i just keep going back to the thought in my mind of how i thought the genesis was so much more comfortable than the e350 and, really, just as good looking.	1
	then i think about the $18,000 that i would still have in my pocket with a v6, or the $13,000 with a v8 (not to mention all the extra power), and i just am amazed.	1
	it is just so much car for the money.	1
	it's crazy.	1
	or maybe the competition is just way too high.........                                bottom line is this.	1
	if you can buy/drive a car without the badge being your main concern, and you want a good (no, not great) handling, quick, very well appointed, and really quiet 4 door sedan then you have got to go drive one of these.	1
	i mean good grief, save the extra money on price and gas mileage (and depreciation as i have mentioned earlier; it has less room to fall) and take an extra trip to hawaii every year with the difference.	1
	or pay off credit cards or whatever.	1
	put this ride heads up against anything short of a m-b amg, or a m series from bmw and you have a real competitor.	1
	but for lots less.	1
	no hyundai dealer should have to say 'well, but it doesn't cost as much' to sell this car.	1
	just let people drive the car, tell them about all of the places where the car meets or exceeds the competition, and then say 'did i mention that all of this costs $10,000-$20,000 less than its competitors?'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1863#msg1863re: driving impressions plus some extra info [allthatblue]        the suspension was outstaning.	1
	i will say that the suspension and the chassis were probably the most impressive thing about this car.	1
	there was virtually no body roll and through the tight turns the car was very easy to 'toss around'.	1
	i think that looking back it was even a bit more impressive now that i realize that i did not have a great feel for the course since it was only one run.	1
	also, there was very little impact felt in the cabin from things on the course.	1
	even the pieces of tire that we were running over, were seen, and then heard a little, but there was very little feeling of being bouced about.	1
	again, the car was a solid performer even heads up with the m-b and the lexus, but holy cow, for the difference in price, this thing was just incredible.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1864#msg1864re: driving impressions plus some extra info [allmet33]        oh, i forgot one other thing.	1
	there was a post i saw a week or two ago stating that the interior of the trunk was not lined or finished out.	1
	this must have been a test mule because the cars that i saw were fully lined and the hinges were covered as well.	1
	if you have seen the inside on the e350's trunk, then you have seen the genesis trunk.	1
	except the genesis trunk is bigger.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1865#msg1865re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        i can't believe that someone would actually think that the car would come with an unlined trunk.	1
	i mean...if the lowly accent has a lined, finished trunk...why wouldn't the flagship sedan?	1
	that's crazy.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1866#msg1866re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        jeffreid,                                thank you for the very informative review!	1
	in the past week, i have taken three months of interest in the genesis and almost completely abandoned it in favor of the 2009 maxima with tech + premium package.	1
	i am not sure; maybe it was a culmination of impatience with the lack of info on the genesis mixed with very positive reviews of the '09 maxima.	1
	both cars should be on the lots in the next few weeks and i feel (based correctly or incorrectly on everything i have read to date) that it is going to be a difficult decision.	1
	i wish it were as easy as asking myself the question of whether i want a fwd, smaller, well appointed stylish vehicle from a reputable manufacturer vs. a rwd, larger, well appointed stylish vehicle from a manufacturer with less respect (but clearly increasing) -- but it is still going to be a tough decision...                                your post is enough to get me excited about the genesis again to the point where it will come down to what it always should have: a test drive in each car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1867#msg1867re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        another dealer on the genesis owners forum has some lease info.	1
	his user name is edvoyleshyundai.	1
	http://genesisowners.com/hyundai-genesis-forum/showthread.php?p=996posted=1#pos- t996        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1868#msg1868re: driving impressions plus some extra info [viking967]        i was a complete fence rider on this until tuesday.	1
	i didn't even want to have an opinion because of the times that i thought hyundai let me down on a car after hearing how great it was going to be.	1
	after seeing the car in person, i want to have you ask yourself one question.	1
	if you were looking at a 2009 max and a 2009 e350 for about the same price, which would you choose?	1
	i think most people would go for the e350 without hesitation.	1
	now i know that the genesis still says hyundai on the back and there is no 3-pointed star, but the genesis really is as nice as the m-b.	1
	seriously.	1
	no, i'm not on drugs.	1
	i'm just saying that you should go drive the car.	1
	if you do, i think you'll be a genesis owner.	1
	i was just blown away.	1
	by the way, depending on where you're at, there may be some very appealing finance offers right at launch.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1869#msg1869re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]         however, it is not the corner-carving bmw fighter that hyundai asked for.	1
	first of all, of course not.	1
	lexus doesn't even have a corner carving bmw fighter.	1
	and second, hyundai didin't ask for a bmw fighter, but a competitor for japenese luxury vehicles.	1
	oh, and the genesis is not as nice a car as the e350.	1
	maybe the gs or the m, but hyundai isn't quite ready for mercedes yet (or bmw, for that matter).	1
	still, hyundai did a good job with this one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1870#msg1870re: driving impressions plus some extra info [docrw]        4-way/8-way, what's the difference?	1
	as long as it adjusts when i need it to.	1
	and as long as it works when i want it to.	1
	8-way great when it works, but aska mercedes owner about the $800 repair for the non-functioning headrest, or the seat that is laid back and will not move.	1
	how about a chocolate fondue set too?	1
	as long as you are at it.	1
	think about what it means to you when gas is $7gal.	1
	coming soon to a filling station near you.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1871#msg1871re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        good point (on the e350 vs. the maxima).	1
	i stopped by a nissan dealer on my way home tonight and saw a 2009 maxima in person but did not get to drive it.	1
	very nice interior and really sweet body design.	1
	but...i was reminded of how i really want something a little bigger.	1
	the lease on the genesis is very attractive (as long as there are not a lot of hidden fees) so i am definitely anxious to take it for a spin!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1872#msg1872i've seen and sat inside a 2009 genesis-finally        my local dealer general manager called me this afternoon and told me that he finally had his first genesis.	1
	read on-this is a good story.	1
	i drove to the dealership and he told me that there was a slight problem with the genesis.	1
	apparently, in front of a small crowd of dealership personnel who were excited about seeing the genesis-the truck driver dropped the car and smashed the top of the roof by the sunroof.	1
	i saw the car about 2 hours later-in the body shop for repairs.	1
	is this terrible luck or what ?	1
	anyway, the car that i saw (except for the damage) was awesome-and believe me-i have researched and driven everything out there and am very picky.	1
	i will be test driving the genesis tomorrow afternoon and will post the results for the rest of you guys-good or bad.	1
	i'm pretty pumped after sitting inside-jeffreid is right-you can move your whole family in the back seat.	1
	the car that i saw and sat in today was a premium plus package, black interior with titanium metallic exterior-sharp.	1
	if you look at the side the car looks like a lexus 460.  thought you guys would like to know that someone has actually seen one in public-finally..........i'll be buying one shortly.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1873#msg1873re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        so is it really confirmed that a loaded 3.8 genesis is $37,000?	1
	and a loaded 4.6 genesis is still $42,000?	1
	yet a base v8 genesis (with multi-piston brembos and premium leather) is still $38,000 and equipped like a v6 with premium package plus.	1
	so i still find it unusual that hyundai would charge so much for the tech package when equipped on the v8s, but not on the v6s.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1874#msg1874re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        jeffreid,                                did they mention why the price would increase in six months?	1
	would it be that hyundai would be offering a couple extra features that got left off this time around?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1875#msg1875re: driving impressions plus some extra info [albook]        have you been in each of these autos?	1
	have you driven a genesis?	1
	the genesis has more room, more power,  more comfortable seats, has a better warranty,  is quieter, and has a comprable level of equipment to the e-class.	1
	for $15k less.	1
	why is the e-class better?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1876#msg1876re: driving impressions plus some extra info [black_pearl]        the story that i got on the price increase was that the korean's were actually a little steamed about the price of this car here versus in their homeland.	1
	i did not get the feeling that there would be any additional features, just that maybe the rising cost of steel and diesel (for ships and such) was contributing to the additional cost.	1
	they have to keep this car as inexpensive as possible for launch you know.	1
	one other note, the guy that told me this is a regional sales manager for hma.	1
	he also told me that the tech pkg v6 should be $37k.	1
	he actually gave me a look like 'you're a moron to even ask such a question'.	1
	he (and another guy from hma) said that what it says in the order guide is correct $33k plus the $4k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1877#msg1877re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        could you comment on the headroom?	1
	i'm tall and that is the #1 question i need to answer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1878#msg1878re: driving impressions plus some extra info [pat2717]        well, i am only 5'11', so most cars fit me pretty well.	1
	i did not notice any issue with headroom.	1
	as i have mentioned previously, the inside of the genesis is very generous with room in pretty well every dimension.	1
	i do not have the interior specs here, but i will try to make a guess based on observation.	1
	we sold a 2009 sonata yesterday to a gentleman that is about 6'3' or 6'4' and weighs in around 280. he and his wife both commented on how they were amazed at the headroom for him even with the moonroof that the car had.	1
	with that being said, the genesis is a little bigger inside than the sonata and as such should be at least as roomy.	1
	hope this helps.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1880#msg1880re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]         have you been in each of these autos?	1
	yes.	1
	have you driven a genesis?	1
	no.	1
	the genesis has more room...                                true.	1
	more power...                                but the e is quicker.	1
	more comfortable seats                                i wouldn't say that.	1
	or:                                 is quieter                                my point is hyundai has done a great job for the first time around.	1
	lexus didn't get this close until 10 years ago.	1
	but the genesis isn't there yet.	1
	there are still little things inside, and a lot of performance that make the mb still superior to this and a lot of other models.	1
	but don't worry.	1
	lexus still isn't quite there.	1
	it takes time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1881#msg1881re: driving impressions plus some extra info [albook]        well, the v8 genesis runs to 60mph in 5.7-5.9 seconds versus the mid-6's for the e350.	1
	i'm not sure how you are going to tell me that the e350 is quicker..........                                also, seeing as how the benz comes in at 13.96 pounds per horse versus 10.87 pounds per horse on the genesis (v8 running regular gas), i just don't see how you can say that the e is quicker.	1
	doesn't make any sense.	1
	also, i am not losing any fuel mileage for the extra power.	1
	again i ask, what little things on the inside are leading to this conclusion, and where are we seeing that a $55k e350 is outperforming my $38k-$42k genesis?	1
	i've been in both cars, and seriously, there really isn't a bunch of tangible difference.	1
	especially not in the direction of the e. all i really saw was some extra adjustments for the passenger seat, an extra memory setting for the driver's seat, and a power headrest.	1
	by the way, i really like the e-class.	1
	it will be on the short list for my wife and i when we buy again in the next couple of years.	1
	so, i 'm not bashing or anything, i'm just trying to look at facts from an objective point of view.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1882#msg1882hyundai financing for genesis        fyi...the hyundai web site has financing and lease rates for the genesis.	1
	some states show financing rates...some states show a lease rate.	1
	link title        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1883#msg1883test drove genesis 3.8 today (silicon valley area)        i test drove genesis 3.8 with premium package today.	1
	the msrp was $35,000.	1
	dealer had 6 cars total shipped in yesterday, 3 of which already sold.	1
	the black genesis i drove was absolutely fantastic.	1
	i own an 06 audi a4 3.2q (6 speed manual), and i am generally very picky about giving good reviews on a car.	1
	a common criticism of genesis in preliminary reviews in magazines was that the car does not handle that well as a 'sports' sedan.	1
	this is simply untrue, as i floored the test car on a 90-degree right turn several times at 35 mph+ and the car stuck to the road extremely well, without any esc intervention.	1
	my audi a4 3.2q does not handle the road better than this car (in dry test conditions).	1
	there is a lot of old-world charm to the car.	1
	the leather wrap-around in the dash is tastefully done, with perfect french-stitching and narrow / precise chrome surrounding each ventilation units.	1
	they shine like jewelry under direct sunlight.	1
	i own an `06 audi a4, which is considered to be one of the finest near-luxury interiors.	1
	let's just say genesis was one grade higher than my (beloved) audi.	1
	some also criticized the genesis in the preliminary review as having a 'softer' suspension than desired and 'muffled' engine note.	1
	this is also untrue.	1
	the car had a perfect combination of comfort and sport, and the suspension re-tuning for the us market was firmer, so it legitimately felt like a sports sedan during a spirited drive.	1
	as an a4 3.2q fsi driver i can attest to this.	1
	when i floored the car, the genesis created a sporty and quite pleasant engine growl; i preferred the genesis 3.8's exhaust note over 3.2 quattro fsi exhaust note.	1
	that's saying something.	1
	the genesis 3.8 is also more fuel-efficient than my a4 3.2 q fsi, although the lambda 3.8 is a higher-displacement engine with more horsepower.	1
	gensis generates 290 hp vs. audi 3.2 q's 255 hp.	1
	overall, hyundai has done a beautiful (almost stunning) job on the genesis.	1
	this car is a real luxury sedan, as opposed to a 'wanna-be'.	1
	if you are a confident person, you wouldn't give a damn about people's so-called 'perceptions' anyway and instead just drive a superior car at 30~35% the cost of the competition with better warranty coverage.	1
	if anything, most people respect you for driving something good and different, because they will perceive you as a confiden person who creates his/her own image, as opposed to latching onto a conventional and boring cultural cliche.	1
	if you test drive the genesis, i think you will be very convinced to purchase the car, especially when you look at its value proposition.	1
	people have compared the genesis to lexus and mercedes benz.	1
	i think the comparison is misplaced.	1
	the genesis is tuned and feels more like an audi, in its artistic interior execution to the suspension tuning (non-rs versions).	1
	if you are a recent audi owner, i think you'll draw similar conclusions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1884#msg1884re: driving impressions plus some extra info [mtnbrfl]        thanks for the link.	1
	still a very positive review, pretty sure that had to do with the car itself                                ---------------------------                                per autoblog's test, the v6 pulled to 60 in 6.2 seconds, and 5.7 seconds in v8.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1885#msg1885re: test drove genesis 3.8 today (silicon valley area) [smc2]        i also drove a genesis 3.8 today with premium plus package-drove for about 2 1/2 hours on highways, surface streets-you name it.	1
	i have driven pretty much every car model out there in my search for a new car-and this car beats them all.	1
	i'm not sure where the trunk release comment came from earlier in this thread-but there is the release button along with the fuel door release-right next to your knee in the driver's seat.	1
	sound system is awesome and the suspension and turning action rival or beat lexus-at least in my opinion.	1
	trunk is well finished and huge.	1
	very fast when you jump on it-extremely smooth and well finished in all regards.	1
	i bought one this afternoon right after i drove it-at msrp of $36000.00.	1
	other dealers in this area are already starting to mark these cars up $5,000.00 to $6,000.00.	1
	drive this car-you will not be sorry and you will probably buy one-i can't say enough-wow !	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1886#msg1886package pricing        by the way-the two dealers that i visited today-one of which sold me a genesis-have no clue as to how the packages are priced, but they are pretty sure that the package 4-tech does not include the subordinate packages.	1
	this is nuts, hyundai corporate has really messed this marketing plan up-the consumers know way more than the dealers who have the cars on their lots.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1887#msg1887not bad        the 32k price for the v6 isn't bad.	1
	it's a lot for a hyundai, but it seems that with some incentives after the honeymoon period is over, they will be able to sell these with some cash on the hood (maybe 3k or 4k).	1
	i just knew the suspension would be the weak link in the car, and all three reviews, plus one video (the korean one) unanimously confirm that.	1
	i will be surprised if my personal test drive leads me to conclude anything different.	1
	for whatever reason, korean engineers just can't seem to button down a suspension properly - i mean, come on,  '[h]owever, if the vehicle is faced with a set of rhythmic dips in the road, the softly sprung genesis gently porpoises a bit more than expected.	1
	at legal speeds it was hardly noticeable.	1
	however, in excess of about 85 mph it became unsettling.'	1
	unsettling!	1
	that's not exactly something i'd expect given who hyundai said they benchmarked with the genesis.	1
	that's terribly disappointing for a car that benchmarks the bmw 7 series or infinity m (i've driven the m35 over a weekend, and that car has a near perfect suspension, imo).	1
	and, to the person who said the mercedes is 12k to 18k more - this is where hyundai may have trouble threading the needle.	1
	12k to 18k amortized over the lifespan of the car isn't really that much in exchange for the prestige of a mercedes emblem.	1
	maybe i'm being too shallow, or maybe i'm recognizing the general public as being too shallow, which may be the true reality.	1
	one last thing, the genesis doesn't seem to be a bad car by any means, but i think i actually like the interior of the azera better.	1
	the genesis interior is just bland.	1
	i'll wait to test drive it before deciding that the criticism of the suspension rings true, and before finalizing my judgment on the interior styling.	1
	i will say this - it had better be much better than a mercedes e350 for me to not be strongly tempted to fork over an additional 12k.	1
	i work in an industry where clients tend to judge one's capabilities and success by the prestige associated with the car they drive, unfortunately.	1
	call it shallow and superficial, but it's the real world.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1888#msg1888im getting it!	1
	i test drove the v6 premium plus pkg at doten hyundai here in the san francisco area.	1
	drives like a beauty, and the car is much better in person that what the photos suggest online!	1
	they also have a great lease deal going on thru the end of the month.	1
	$399 for base v6, $419 for v6 w/premium pkg.	1
	not sure what the cost for the pp pkg but i assume it will be $10 more per month= $429.	1
	the top of the line v6 with tech pkg should be around $449/mo.	1
	great rates indeed.	1
	the only thing that stopped me from purchasing outright was the fact that there will be no white exterior colors produced according to the sale mgr.	1
	im very saddened about that, as it was my first choice color.	1
	i currently have a 06 azera black and its tough to keep clean.	1
	but the genesis in northern ca are very scarce.	1
	there are only about 30 of them so far in a 100 mile radius.	1
	from san jose up to sacramento!!	1
	the black color on the genesis is black pearl so its different from the base black coat on the azera, sonatas...others.	1
	also hyundai does not have a program where you can exit your lease early (atleast 50% into) and hop into another lease unfortunately.	1
	the only option was to roll over the equity into the new lease, which kinda worked out good for me.	1
	also, i know there are 15 speakers in the car but where are they all located??	1
	when i test drove the car, the sales mgr was with me and we both couldnt count up to 15!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1889#msg1889re: not bad [rotary]        don't hold your breath on the $3k-$4k rebate on the genesis.	1
	hyundai is absolutley determined to sell the genesis and the veracruz with a minimum of factory money.	1
	with the veracruz taking a year to get any money on them at all, and the fact that the genesis is being planned as a realatively low volume model, any cash back will most likely be a ways off and fairly small when it does come around.	1
	the best news though is the 0.9% finacing available for 48 months.	1
	if one can leave their cash in an investment at, say 5.00%, you would be talking about a net gain of around $5500 over 4 years.	1
	in my mind that's way better than $3kk-$4k if it was available.	1
	and as to the review that you speak of, it seems to be in the minority.	1
	one other review i read stated that at 100+ mph that the genesis was 'rock-solid'.	1
	it seems hard to reconcile those two opinions.	1
	glad to hear that some of you did get to drive the car.	1
	i expected to hear positive things, but wow, you guys really are doing some great advertising!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1890#msg1890re: not bad [jeffreid]        jeffreid-you are absolutely right.	1
	i drove a genesis v6 yesterday for over 2 hours and had it up to 120 mph-rock solid and never wavered.	1
	you're a dealer so you will get a kick out of this-the gm of my local dealer was with me on the test drive so we decided to pull up to the lexus dealership and park next to an ls460-same color/half the price.	1
	the car looks very similar and needless to say, the lexus salesman that came out were biting their fingernails when the figured out that this was a hyundai.	1
	priceless......        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1891#msg1891re: not bad [deeezldoc]        that is one of the funniset things i have ever heard!!!	1

	the last commnet in this review is impressive.	1
	'a key marketing angle hyundai wants to press home to genesis is that it approaches the size of bmw 7-series in packaging, gives the performance of a 5-series, and is priced like 3-series.	1
	all true                  '        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1893#msg1893re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]         well, the v8 genesis runs to 60mph in 5.7-5.9 seconds versus the mid-6's for the e350.	1
	i'm not sure how you are going to tell me that the e350 is quicker..........                                i understand that you feel for the price, you can compare the two, but you still have to compare apples to apples.	1
	the e500, though 60k, would blow the genesis' doors off with it's 0-60 sprint of 4.8 (!)	1
	seconds.	1
	and i believe the e350 does it in 6.2 (i'm not completely sure, but around that).	1
	that's pretty close to 5.9, and the genesis v6 does it in a hair under 7 seconds.	1
	also, mt got a combined fuel economy of 17.6 for the e500, and i would bet big that the genesis won't get any better than 19, so that won't be much of a difference.	1
	other stuff mt noticed (that aren't quite acceptable for a lux car):                'hyundai didn't sweat the details, thoguh, because elsewhere they're less impressive.	1
	the hood gap is a bit too wide.	1
	the genesis has gooseneck hinges (not bad, but they're not gas filled shockes) and parcel shelf speaker and subwoofer bottoms of that high end lexicon system are left expose.	1
	a 21k malibu's trunk is finished better.'	1
	-mt.	1
	i could go on, but that's enough.	1
	my point is, the genesis is nice, but hyundai still has bugs to work out.	1
	mercedes has been world class luxury leader for 20+ years.	1
	so to say the hyundia's first try outdoes mb is simply silly.	1
	no doubt a better value, but not a better package.	1
	though with time, that will change.	1
	as we are seeing, the koreans like to play hardball.	1
	by the way, i really like the e-class.	1
	it will be on the short list for my wife and i when we buy again in the next couple of years.	1
	so, i 'm not bashing or anything, i'm just trying to look at facts from an objective point of view.	1
	i'm sort of in the same boat.	1
	when i decide to sell my 545 (which actually may be more than just a couple of years from now)this will get a look.	1
	so will the cts, and upcoming tl.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1894#msg1894new car reviews        most new car reviews are glowing.	1
	you can't glean much useful information about a car through them, other than specs, nor can you do so through a test drive, no matter how long it is.	1
	the true test of a car's inherent quality, value and driveability is when you live with it, day in and day out, for a period of years.	1
	that's when the warts begin to surface.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1895#msg1895re: new car reviews [rotary]        so far based on the automotive press reviews from multiple sources, including comments and opinions posted here, and at other automotive forums from real world test drives and now from actual owners, this vehicle seems very impressive.	1
	for those of us who haven't yet driven this vehicle (myself included),  i will have to reserve opinion/bias/perceptions, etc.	1
	until i have had an opportunity to see some serious wheel time.	1
	the speculation about this car was interesting before it landed.	1
	now that it has, i think we are way past the speculative in terms of which vehicle genesis exceeds or meets in quality and expectation.	1
	i think judgment in regards to how best genesis ranks against the established premium brands will be an open book until a comparison test between the established lux brands within striking target of the genesis has been conducted.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1896#msg1896re: driving impressions plus some extra info [albook]        i will certainly concede that the e550 is a more powerful and faster car than the genesis.	1
	that should be pretty clear.	1
	my thought process was that i could throw in a v8 car vs. the e350 and keep a big enough monetary savings to still make a strong argument.	1
	now, i will still throw out for debate the idea that a 375 horse v8 will provide more than enough thrust for nearly any driver.	1
	when you combine that with the $20k+ savings, i think that the extra bit of acceleration becomes very expensive.	1
	a note about your mt review.	1
	this car must have been a test mule or complete preproduction model.	1
	this car does have gas struts on the hood, and it does have a fully finished trunk.	1
	matter of fact, the trunk linings and the plastic that covers the trunk hinges in the genesis and the e350 seem to have come off of the same assembly line.	1
	they look exactly the same!!	1
	i just point this out to say that mt must have gotten a car that was not finished, b/c there aren't any real world genesis' that are like that.	1
	i also understand the point of defending the m-b brand.	1
	they are the sign of success in my mind as they are in many other's.	1
	i just am of the mindset that the substance of what rolls of of the assembly line is more important than the 'idea' of what is rolling off of that line.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1897#msg1897re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        i completely agree with jeffreid.	1
	here is where the point about an upcoming, soon, sure to come, comparison test between the genesis and its rivals will be helpful and at the very least will offer more insight into just how much on par or dare we say, better than the established premium brands the genesis targets.	1
	some questions and judgments will be made about whether it handles, accelerates, meets nvh quality, luxury appointments, and whatever other finer points of the vehicle are to be assessed and judged by the experts.	1
	it will certainly let us know whether it is a game changer in terms of its value/quality equation.	1
	at least, based on what we know, the value proposition is hard to argue.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1898#msg1898re: im getting it!	1
	[professionalr]         the only thing that stopped me from purchasing outright was the fact that there will be no white exterior colors produced according to the sale mgr.	1
	no white, are they crazy???	1
	here in florida i think white is the most popular color.	1
	i have 3 pearl white cars (lexus  infiniti).	1
	i was happy that hyundai was supposed to have a pearl white.	1
	apparently not.	1
	i guess it is like the pontiac g8 where they advertised a medium blue color, even had one of the car mags test one and then discontinued the color.	1
	my dealer still claims it might be the end of july before they get their first car.	1

	the v8 at 5.7 secs...                                you've got to hand it to hyundai, they have two powerful engines, with very very respectable power ratings, combined with fantastic fuel economy ratings in a car that weighs almost two tons.	1
	and i haven't even mentioned price/value/packaging yet                                by the way, the genesis v8 uses a 4.6l, while the e550 uses a 5.5l - almost a whole liter larger but horsepower rating only marginal better than the genesis, a little better on the torque.	1
	this gives a good indication the power of the genesis:                                 the final comparison took place on an unused straight-a-way.	1
	it was essentially a 'drag race' between the genesis 4.6 and a bmw 750i.	1

	i had a feeling that an additional $1000.00 above the premium plus package wouldn't buy the loaded car-didn't make sense that way.	1
	makes sense this way.	1
	i bought a package 3 (premium plus) yesterday but wanted to pass on this clarification since there were several versions going around based on limited info.	1
	hope this helps.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1904#msg1904re: driving impressions plus some extra info [joe97]         by the way, the genesis v8 uses a 4.6l, while the e550 uses a 5.5l - almost a whole liter larger but horsepower rating only marginal better than the genesis, a little better on the torque.	1
	why is the genesis so slow then?	1
	it has the almost the same power to weight ratio as the e550 (382 hp, 4099 lbs according to motor trend compared to 375 hp, 4006 lbs with the genesis), but the e550 still goes 0-60 about 1 second quicker (4.8).	1
	also, the g8 is heavier then the genesis and has less power (361 hp, 4106 lbs), but is still consistently quicker (5.4 0-60 and quarter mile in 13.7 seconds).	1
	incidentally, the genesis even has a similar power to weight ratio as the e39 m5 (4024 lbs, 394 hp under the old rating), but is still considerably slower.	1
	the passat that won first place on motor trend, only makes 200 hp and weighs 3413 lbs compared to 290 hp and 3748 lbs for the v6 genesis, but does 0-60 in 6.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 15.0 seconds.	1
	it's about as fast or faster than the azera or v6 sonata, and slightly slower than the genesis.	1
	straightline performance isn't everything, but it's a big part of what defines a sports sedan.	1
	i don't know why the genesis doesn't perform better.	1
	maybe it's those german horses...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1905#msg1905re: package pricing [deeezldoc]        finally, it all makes sense to me, except that i still think that the tech package is overpriced.	1
	but hyundai is going to make their money somehow, even if they have to borrow a page from porsche (ridiculously overpriced options).	1
	the tech package really comes down to navigation/backup camera, and adaptive hids which are available aftermarket for a fraction of the dealer cost.	1
	they probably won't be as nice or fancy, but you can get them later if these features are really that important to you.	1
	i guess the tech package does also come with a ventillated seat.	1
	just the one though.	1
	the two extra speakers, and parking sensors are more like overkill.	1
	at $36,000 for a premium plus genesis, i would consider waiting for the v8.	1
	yes, it gets worse fuel mileage, but we're only talking about 2 miles per gallon.	1
	unless you drive a lot, it probably translates to around $600 a year.	1
	that's at $5.00 a gallon and 20,000 city miles a year.	1
	at $4.00 a gallon, it would be around $120 more each year for every 10,000 highway miles; it would be about $245 more each year for every 10,000 city miles.	1
	the only other negative with the v8 is that it's heavier so it might not be as 'tossable' in the corners.	1
	260 lbs is like an extra passanger and some more gas in the tank.	1
	and insurance premiums are probably higher.	1
	otherwise, the engine and transmission are more refined, the steering feel is supposedly better, and there are things standard on the v8 that are not available on the v6, such as premium leather and better brakes (i'm not completely sure on this).	1
	all for 2 grand.	1
	or as i would like to call it, the v8 package.        	1

	(msrp is listed-not taking into account dealer markup)                                well, if hyundai is going to allocate a lot of $40k v6 genesis cars to dealer lots, it will be their phaeton - i don't care if they have an automatic kleenex dispenser and itch scratcher.	1
	the further north of 30k, the fewer of these cars hyundai will sell.	1
	it was supposed to be a sub-30k car when hyundai first leaked details of it.	1
	now we have 40k v6 models.	1
	i wonder what the loaded v8 models will cost?	1
	i'm more skeptical than ever.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1908#msg1908re: package pricing [rotary]        the rumored sub-$30k genesis was a) never supposed to be a loaded car, as is the $40k v6, and b) was going to be a 3.3l v6, which hyundai decided not to bring to this market, at least not now.	1
	plus there is the little matter of the declining value of the dollar since the word of a sub-$30k genesis came out.	1
	we know exactly what loaded v8 models cost, at least the msrp pricing.	1
	if you're curious, check out edmunds.com's new car listings for hyundais--the genesis details are right there.	1
	since you've made it clear that the genesis is not the car for you, hyundai will just have to sell one of those $33k to over $40k cars to someone else.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1909#msg1909re: package pricing [backy]        i am very disappointed.	1
	not an issue for anyone else but me.	1
	i was very excited to hear about the hyundai genesis and stopped my purchase to look at this car.	1
	i finally went to see the car and was very impressed.	1
	with all the additional $'s for the packages, the cost of the hyundai is in the same range as the infinity m35.	1
	i really thought the overall cost of the hyundai would be $35k fully loaded.	1
	now i need to make the decision - brand new car with no history versus a car with a lot of history.	1
	i like the way the hyundai looks and have read the reviews but now the cost is making me rethink.	1
	i am bummed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1910#msg1910re: package pricing [notacarbuff1]        i am confused.	1
	the msrp of the base m35, which is a v6 with 5-speed at, is $44,665--which is $11,665 more than the base genesis v6 with 6at and is actually more than the fully loaded genesis                 v8                .	1
	so maybe what is in the 'same range' for you is not what i would consider in the same range.	1
	imo, $12,000+ after tax but before interest can buy a lot of history.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1911#msg1911re: package pricing [rotary]         it was supposed to be a sub-30k car when hyundai first leaked details of it.	1
	now we have 40k v6 models.	1
	i wonder what the loaded v8 models will cost?	1
	who said it was going to be a sub-30k car?	1
	the azera is a sub-30k car.	1
	plus, the weak dollars had a lot to do with the pricing - everyone's raising prices, as a matter of fact.	1
	loaded v8 - i thought we've covered this a million times already.	1
	anyway, with all of the bells and whistles, a loaded v8 msrp for 42k.	1
	by the way, the 40k v6 is a loaded v6, but i've been told by a dealer a loaded v6 is 37k msrp, going to have to confirm.	1
	let's get this out in the open, by the way, this information is also available all over the internet:                                genesis v6: 33,000 msrp (with handling)                genesis v8: 38,000 msrp (with handling)                                 http://www.hyundainews.com/media_kits/2009_models/genesis/pricing.asp                                phaeton, are you kidding me?	1
	you do recall the cost of the phaeton, right?	1
	i still don't understand how the pricing of the genesis is anything like the phaeton, actually far from alike.	1
	still a fantastic car, nontheless        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1912#msg1912re: driving impressions plus some extra info [akuma]        well, torque is a big factor.	1
	also, hyundai has tuned both engines not only for more-than-adequate power but also fuel economy.	1
	have you seen the ratings on the g8 gt?	1
	not good - even when using cyclinder deactivation.	1
	fwiw, i was saying the power per liter on the engine range of the genesis is fantastic - 375hp from a 4.6l, while g8 and e550 use 6.1l and 5.5l, respectively.	1
	i wouldn't say the genesis is slow at all, after all, it passes the 750i with ease everytime                6.2 secs and 5.8 secs (v6  v8) to 60 are very good numbers.	1
	like you said, straight-line performance doesn't mean a lot; plus, this is a luxury sedan, not a sports sedan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1913#msg1913        m35, for $41,045 + ttl here i come.	1
	i've test driven it three times, including a weekend trip (my local infiniti dealer is that cool).	1
	consumer reports has it as there highest rated luxury car, outscoring the mercedes s class, bmw 7 series, lexus ls, acura rl and audi a8, even though some of these cars cost more than twice as much.	1
	i absolutely love it, based on my experience.	1
	consumer reports has nailed it.	1
	the ride, handling and technology are all absolutely superb.	1
	the base model is loaded enough for me:                                 the standard rear-drive m35 comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, 10-way power and climate-controlled front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, wood accents, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a sunroof, adaptive xenon headlights, bluetooth and a six-speaker audio system with a six-cd/mp3 changer, satellite radio and an auxiliary audio jack.	1
	hyundai screwed up.	1
	i figured they would.	1
	i won't even bother test driving it now, unless it's purely out of curiosity.	1
	that 11k difference, backy?	1
	i'll more than make up for it when i resell my infiniti, as the resale value is leagues above hyundai's.	1
	i am very disappointed in hyundai's pricing scheme.	1
	if they thought they had a shot at conquest sales from the lower or upper ends, they couldn't have picked a worse price range if they tried.	1
	the will lose to toyota avalons on the low end, for about 26k, to infiniti ms, bmw 5s, mercedes es and even lexus gss on the upper end.	1
	and i can guarantee you a lot of people will feel this way when they catch that first screenshot of real dealer lot window stickers.	1
	and that is a true disappointment.	1
	however, i still wish hyundai and the genesis good luck.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1914#msg1914re:  [rotary]        i hope you will enjoy the m35 that you will buy very much.	1
	it looks like a great car.	1
	but keep in mind that you will need to sell your m35 for much more than $11k more than the genesis to make up for the price difference, due to the time value of money.	1
	for example, if you keep your cars for a long time (which i prefer to do), say 10 years, the time value of $12k (let's not forget sales tax) after 10 years at just 6% interest compounded annually is nearly $21,500.	1
	so you need to add that investment gain (or avoidance of interest on a loan you pay off) into the depreciation calculation.	1
	it would be difficult if not impossible to make out better financially with the infiniti.	1
	also keep in mind that near-msrp pricing will probably only hold for the genesis for a short time, until the 'gotta be the first one in my neighborhood to own a genesis' buyers are satiated.	1
	then the prices will, i think, float to more realistic numbers.	1
	and in today's real world, most people expect discounts on cars like these, even if they start at a much lower price than competitors.	1
	but it's not just about money, is it?	1
	it's about what you will enjoy driving more over those years.	1
	just curious, though: what would you think if cr rates the genesis over the m35 when it gets around to testing it?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1915#msg1915re:  [rotary]        yeah the genesis is way too expensive, hyundai should have priced from $500.00 and a loaded genesis should be around $550.00.	1
	you say you own an infiniti, and you are complaining about the price?	1
	come on now.	1
	i won't even bother test driving it now                                i was actually surprised you considered test driving the car, as late as about 18 hours ago.	1
	i really didn't think you would have bothered in the first place.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1916#msg1916re:  [rotary]        enjoy the infiniti        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1917#msg1917re:  [backy]        i was looking to buy a car in the next 30 to 60 days.	1
	you're right, though - the newness issue will probably kill any incentives hyundai offers during the first few months.	1
	all cars today have incentives, unless they're truly limited in supply, such as the new alfa romeo, or other exotics.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1918#msg1918re:  [rotary]        i saw that fitzmall, one of the larger hyundai dealers out east, has 8 genesises (genesii?)	1
	in or coming, all v6 with premium or premium plus packages, and they are all priced (internet pricing) with a $369 discount off msrp.	1
	not much, but a start.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1919#msg1919re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]         i also understand the point of defending the m-b brand.	1
	they are the sign of success in my mind as they are in many other's.	1
	i just am of the mindset that the substance of what rolls of of the assembly line is more important than the 'idea' of what is rolling off of that line.	1
	so it seems you understandmy point in saying that while the hyundai is a much better value, the mb is still a superior car, though not by much.	1
	but that's okay.	1
	mb hasbeen developing it's world class stigma twice as long as hyundai has been a car company.	1
	so that's expected.	1
	how successful hyundai's execution was the first time around was not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1920#msg1920re: driving impressions plus some extra info [joe97]         the genesis 3.8 tips the scales at 3,748 pounds and scoots to 60 mph in a decent 6.2 seconds.	1
	where did that number come from?	1
	like i said, mt got 6.8.	1
	6.2 would defeat the purpose of the 8 cylinder.	1
	by the way, the genesis v8 uses a 4.6l, while the e550 uses a 5.5l - almost a whole liter larger but horsepower rating only marginal better than the genesis, a little better on the torque.	1
	okay.	1
	doesn't the audi a6 have a 4.2 that makes 350hp?	1
	and the mb is still better tuned for better driving dynamics.	1
	the final comparison took place on an unused straight-a-way.	1
	it was essentially a 'drag race' between the genesis 4.6 and a bmw 750i.	1
	as expected, the lighter and more powerful genesis won each time.	1
	this shows nothing.	1
	they even say that the 750 is heavier.	1
	the 550 can outrun the 750. the e500 can outrun the s550.	1
	the gs outruns the ls.	1
	when hyundai creates a fullsize luxury car in 5-10 years (if they do well enough here) the genesis will outrun it.	1
	and the genesis will either have to shrink to compete squarely with the 5/e, or grow the s-class size so an e fighter can slot under it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1921#msg1921here yet?	1
	from some of the comments on posts, it sounds to me like the genesis will be arriving in a couple of weeks.	1
	is this true?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1922#msg1922re: driving impressions plus some extra info [albook]        6.2 to 60 came from autoblog - i was using the same source posted originally.	1
	like i said, hyundai really didn't add the 'technology' on this iteration - direct injection, cyclinder deactivation.	1
	still, it comes out well ahead, with excellent power figures, and fuel economy ratings to match.	1
	by the way, alg gives the genesis 50% (v6) and 49% (v8) residual value after 3 years, if i recall correctly.	1
	good stuff.	1
	actually, i am not surprised, the azera, veracruz, and rest of the line all have much improved ratings.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1923#msg1923re: here yet?	1

	no offense.	1
	i think that buying fully-loaded v8 matching the size of bmw 7-series and the performance of infinity m only for 42k is almost steal as it is.	1
	v6 trim is not much different.	1
	imo the pricing of genesis wasn't done wrong.	1
	instead poor dealership experience or late and untimely shipment might be problems.	1
	as many papers and articles said, product won't matter for the price.	1
	hyundai's marketing and sales policy would matter though.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1925#msg1925re: package pricing [allthatblue]        well said there.	1
	hyundai even admitted themselves, while not directly, marketing hasn't been a strong suit when compared to the product.	1
	that said, it has been reported the company will spend close to $80 million for the us launch of the genesis.	1

	well, automotive news is reporting hyundai motor america has priced the new genesis luxury sedan at $33,000 for the v6 version and $38,000 for the v8.	1
	i predict that within a year or less, hyundai will be tossing heavy incentives on the hoods of these cars, and the people who purchased out of the gate close to msrp will be cursing hyundai.	1
	i've been wrong before, but i feel very confident that i will be proven correct on this thesis.	1

	just because you don't mind paying over 12 grand more for a different brand doesn't mean everyone feels the same way.	1

	recently i noticed lots of elantra and 2009 sonata in my neighborhood (burlingame, ca).	1
	i see more sonata's than the new accord now.	1
	in a few days hyundai will release the june sales result.	1
	it'll be very interesting to see.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1929#msg1929        i edited my post, backy.	1
	that was in bad taste.	1
	i stand by my comment about the pricing, though.	1
	hyundai made a very big mistake by leaking pricing of below 30k (which they definitely did - some in the blogosphere claim even for the v8 model, while others for the v6), and then coming in with what i guarantee will be a near 80% mix of 35k and up vehicles on dealer lots.	1
	in the league hyundai now wants to play in - with acura, infiniti, lexus, cadillac and even mid sized bmws and mercedes - they are either extremely confident or extremely naive to price the genesis closer to the 40k price point by the time all fees, including ttl are factored in, rather than the 30k they originally spoke of.	1
	...especially given economic conditions now and the penchant for fuel sippers.	1
	only time will tell if confidence or naivety reigns supreme.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1930#msg1930re: package pricing [backy]        not sure if i agree on the pricing you gave.	1
	i have negotiated a deal with a fully loaded m35 at $42k.	1
	unlike the hyundai and the hybrid cars, there are deals to be made that are below invoice.	1
	i have yet to pay msrp or invoice on a car in my life.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1931#msg1931re: pricing [sg2k]        heh you might see my sonata then since i'm in your neck of the woods :p                sonatas are certainly selling decently, but nowhere near accord levels though.	1
	13k doesn't compare to 50k.	1
	but i love the amount of advertising they're doing on the sonata though.	1
	it's all over the edmunds website.	1
	anyways if you compare the genesis to comparable vehicles, it's certainly cheaper.	1
	as a brand new model, everyone should know that there's a new owner cost in terms of cost and reliability and whatnot.	1
	it's kinda like buying an iphone early, you pay for being the early adopter.	1
	i think the genesis is priced fine, it's way too feature filled to be under 30k normally.	1
	i figure with rebates 6 months from now, it'll be more of a 32-37k car, still pricey, but reasonable and basically similar cost to entry bmw/mercedes/lexus.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1932#msg1932on sale right now        2009 genesis' are on sale already.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1933#msg1933re: driving impressions plus some extra info [albook]        well, no.	1
	i am not conceding that the e350 (that is the specific car i am talking about here) is a superior car to the genesis (especially the v8 model at a $13,000 discount).	1
	i was saying that the idea of the m-b is tops, not the car itself.	1
	that is where the prestige factor comes in.	1
	i am going to hold fast to my opinion that the genesis having more passenger room, more power, better fuel economy, and other advantages that still makes it the better buy.	1
	but yes, m-b is the better logo.	1
	also, on another note.	1
	there will be white cars available.	1
	if you can't find one at your local dealer,and they can't dealer trade for one,  contact hyundai motor america and ask them to locate one for you.	1
	they will give you the dealers that have the car that you want.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1934#msg1934re: package pricing [notacarbuff1]        i was quoted an m35 for just over 41k, and the salesman, who i've dealt with in the past, although at a different dealership, told me infiniti may be rolling out additional incentives in july because the luxury segment is getting slammed because of the economy.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1935#msg1935anyone seen these?	1
	there's an interesting (well, i watched all 30 minutes of it) youtube video, where the main hyundai guy, john krafcik gives a long presentation on the features of the genesis and how it compares to its competitive set (pontiac g8, chrysler 300c, lexus es350, cadillac cts)and to its 'image' target competitors (bmw 5, mercedes e, lexus gs, and infiniti m).	1
	no love for audi or acura i guess.	1
	i think audi is more than equal to infiniti at the very least in image.	1
	of course the presentation is biased; he only seems to talk about the things in which the genesis comes out ahead (quite a few things actually), but it's hard to argue with the numbers if they are all indeed true.	1
	http://youtube.com/watch?v=yjia6k0rnqg                                there's another video (about 6 minutes) where the main ride and handling engineer, wendell collins, talks about what they were trying to do with the genesis.	1
	he says how the end result of the genesis exceeded his expectations.	1
	which says a lot considering the bmw, mercedes, lexus and infiniti were the benchmarks.	1
	of course, this is the hyundai guy talking, so it's very biased, but stil interesting.	1
	http://youtube.com/watch?v=tb4i9betef8                                finally, on the genesis owners website, there's someone who actually bought and took delivery of a 3.8 premium plus genesis.	1
	he was a previous owner of the second generation acura tl (worst version), the e39 bmw 528 (the best one), and a 2006 lexus gs 430 (eh).	1
	never owned a hyundai before, and so far, he says it's way better than the acura and lexus, although he was annoyed that the current ipod support/compatibility was minimal.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1936#msg1936re:  [rotary]        let's get to the real story here, and not with speculations.	1
	the 30k comment was made with the intention of the 3.3 model.	1
	which hyundai corporate wanted to send, and hyundai usa didn't want.	1
	plus, had the 3.3 model existed for the north american market, it would have been something like 29,995.                                trust me on this, and you can verify this with hyundai if you'd like, the pricing range for the genesis (in the us) was never a sub-30k car!!!	1
	stop listening to rumors and start relying on facts.	1
	had the genesis be a sub-30k car, it would have overlapped with the azera (at least in terms of pricing).	1
	i don't get how you even think the pricing for genesis is too much, when some of the other cars in the class you'd have to fork over 25-50% premium, or more.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1937#msg1937re: package pricing [notacarbuff1]        and exactly, you shouldn't pay msrp/invoice.	1
	understand the genesis is a brand-new car.	1
	i remember when the m first came out, you really couldn't find much discounts, if any.	1
	it's all about demand and supply.	1
	still, the m35 vs. genesis v6, in terms of pricing, you'd come out ahead on the genesis, unless the infiniti dealers are giving them away        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1938#msg1938re: package pricing [joe97]        i appreciate the feedback.	1
	i am really asking this as i am churning in trying to make a decision.	1
	if m35 is at $42k and genesis is at $40k and i cannot wait for 6-9 months to get the genesis price reduced, why would i buy the genesis?	1
	the reason i am asking is some of you are very knowledgeable and would appreciate your insight.	1
	it is also a very pro-genesis board.	1
	any insights would be appreciated.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1939#msg1939re: package pricing [notacarbuff1]        drop by your local dealer and see what they are offering.	1
	also, hyundai is starting the us launch with a $399/mo (v6) lease program - fantastic rates.	1
	a loaded m35 is mid 50k - you got it down to 42k, well done there!!	1
	i believe m37/m50 should be around the corner, replacing the current m35/45, along with the 7 speed (5 speed currently).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1940#msg1940re: package pricing [notacarbuff1]        if you can get a loaded m35 for $42k (a huge, huge discount off list, even before those even bigger july discounts that are apparently coming), you like the m35 at least as much as the loaded genesis v6 (which may be difficult to determine since apparently none of those is available to drive here yet), and you have to make a decision                 now                , before big discounts are available on the genesis, imo it's a pretty easy decision.	1
	your decision is probably even easier due to the fact that it appears, from an earlier post, that the genesis v6s with technology package will be delayed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1941#msg1941re: on sale right now [rv65]        haven't heard the tech package being delayed                 yet                .	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1943#msg1943re: package pricing [milan13]        since insurance rates are so variable, with so many different factors, it might be better to ask your insurance agent these questions.       	1

	if i could find a dead horse to beat on i think it would be a better use of my time.	1
	yes, the m-b brand is ahead in terms of brand prestige (could anything be more obvious?)	1
	but no, the e350 is not a better executed car than the genesis.	1
	matter of fact, in terms of content, drive dynamics, use of interior space, and nearly any other measure of a vehicle, the genesis is one of the better examples of superior execution on the market.	1
	the e350 is more money simply because of the three pointed star.	1
	there is absolutely no reason that that car should be $13000 more than a v8 genesis is if you are looking at the execution of the car or the actual car itself.	1
	strip off the badges and then explain the $13000+  to anyone!!!!!!	1
	glad to see many of you have been able to find and take delivery of your new automobiles.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1948#msg1948re: driving impressions plus some extra info [jeffreid]        i guess you have to use msrp and compare apples to apples.	1
	what you can buy a year end 08 and new 09 for are 2 differnt things, so it's not exactly a 'fair fight'.	1
	i think the v8 genesis is a really good value on paper.	1
	even loaded up g35's and acura tl's are pushing 40k these days.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1949#msg1949re:  [rotary]        you start out by spending more, so yeah...there'll be more when it comes to resale.	1
	however, if you look at it in terms of percentage lost between new car price and resale price...the percentage of loss is gonna be pretty close to the same.	1
	so...do you really make up for that $11k???	1
	now, if you base your decision on a car with history vs. a first time product...i can definitely see how your choice can be swayed.	1
	however...with hyundai's recent history concerning quality, durability and reliability...i really don't think one could go wrong.	1
	however, that is just my opinion.	1
	oh...and the genesis losing out to the avalon, yeah right.	1
	if the azera is a close competitor to the avalon and the genesis proves to be even better than the azera...the genesis would be the one to take the sales as opposed to the avalon.	1
	i mean...even though they would both be large sedans, the avalon and genesis are two different animals.	1
	sorry, bad choice to compare to.	1
	now if you had said, g8, 300c/charger r/t, m35/45 or gs....well, now we're on to something.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1950#msg1950sensible price thinking for once?	1
	why don't we all just wait until the end of the model year for genesis and see how prices compare then.	1
	it's far too early to compare any price on a new car vs a car that is years old.	1
	nobody buys based on low price for the genesis right now, if you did...you would know to wait 6 months.	1
	i think right now is the time to compare the genesis features against others and ignore price.	1
	such as, from what i can tell, the v6 genesis blows avalon out the door.	1
	it's got the advantage of rwd, far more features, a more powerful engine, similar fuel economy, more interior space.	1
	and a lot more luxury.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1951#msg1951running out of things to talk about?	1
	i read through these posts and it surprises me how much mb gets enthroned here.	1
	comparing vehicles that are not even in the same price range is a total waste of time and reading.	1
	you guys compare the genesis with mb as if it's close in price comparison.	1
	the question you should be asking is how does hyundai implement all these 'options' into this car and still keep the price affordable.	1
	if you think the price is too much for a hyundai then go spend another $8-15k more for your image icon, if your insecurity level is that high!	1
	enough with the bashing on hyundai because it's not 'prestige' enough.	1
	the last time i checked, there's nothing 'prestige' about mb when their reliability ranking/reputation has plummeted.	1
	the only thing that brings people to the dealers is the icon.	1
	is that a smart consumer or a branding consumer?	1
	take all the options of the genesis and compare them with cars equipped of same and see if the price is close.	1
	seems like the genesis is in a class by itself.	1
	the only thing close to the v8 in power is the g8 gt and it doesn't even have half the options the genesis does.	1
	don't try to cover the sky with your hand... some of you are looking rather foolish with what's being said here.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1954#msg1954re:  [allmet33]         i mean...even though they would both be large sedans, the avalon and genesis are two different animals.	1
	they may be different animals, however, they will be cross-shopped.	1
	they are in the same price range, close in equipment levels (genesis does win here), and are roughly the same size.	1
	people shop cars based on their budget, sure there are people that can afford whatever they want and will buy the genesis based on value alone.	1
	however, people like myself who are in the mid 30s price range there are alot of options ranging from something small like the g onto the avalon, max and yes the genesis (v6).	1
	imo these are the buyers hyundai should want.	1
	i agree with many other posters, that the people who are driving mb/lex/inf/bmw are not 'downgrading' to a hyundai whether or not its the better car.	1
	now that i have that out of the way.... i will be in the vicinity of a hyundai dealer this weekend and will probably go in and see if they have any yet.	1

	the image factor makes this statement true, until hyundai can establish themselves as one of the elite - which it has already taken a giant step.	1
	that said, buyers choosing the genesis over and/or from other luxury models are certainly not 'downgrading'                at least from the perspective of the car itself.	1
	one of the first owners of the genesis came from a number of luxury models, more recently the lexus gs, and that owner liked the genesis a lot a lot more.	1
	this is why i predict the genesis will get a good number of people jumping ship from the luxury end - those looking for a premium car but not necessarily image conscious or to keep up with the joneses        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1963#msg1963re:  [joe97]         that said, buyers choosing the genesis over and/or from other luxury models are certainly not 'downgrading'  at least from the perspective of the car itself                                i'll give you that, even just on paper its there.	1
	i haven't driven one yet, so i can't comment... yet.	1
	as for the 'downgrading' i suspect one aspect of the luxury makes is the service.	1
	hyundai dealerships are not known for great service and owners of mb/bmw and especially lexus are.	1
	so, like anything you get what you pay for.	1
	the genesis delivers a lot for the money but, the 'frills' may be missing whether its plush dealerships with great service or a badge.	1
	for people with disposable income that could be the difference.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1965#msg1965re: correction [coug3]        i'm not really sure as to why the delay is there.	1
	the best bet i have right now is that hyundai was not prepared for a large percentage of units being ordered with the same package and color and may not have all of the hardware.	1
	that is total speculation though.	1
	this is the first time that hyundai has given dealers the ability to direct order a vehicle, and i wonder what effect that has had, if any.	1
	one note on this though.	1
	i went ahead and called my rep to ask about a time frame.	1
	he wasn't really very informative, but he seemed to think that we were looking at a delay of no more than a month for white paint or a tech package.	1
	he either didn't know what the delay was about or just wasn't supposed to say.	1
	not really sure.	1
	point is, if you are wanting this particular ride, you might go ahead and start trying to see who around you has one of these coming in and see if you can get your name one the white with tech you want.	1
	hopefully a dealer near you will have a premium plus package on the lot that you can drive.	1
	if you like the premium plus then you'll also like the tech pkg.	1
	hope this helps.	1
	my source for the zero counts is my national dealer locator, not any of our reps. the locator seems to be more reliable..............        	1

	the hyundai website is back to saying 'offer expired' under the special offer lease terms.	1
	i know that you previously referenced a posting to another website with lease info but it seemed to have different info than the hyundai site.	1
	now that we are looking at $40k for a loaded v-6 msrp then i am even more interested in a 24 or 36 month lease.	1
	on a separate note, it is going to get tougher and tougher for automakers.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1967#msg1967re:  [joe97]        i honestly believe that as gas prices continue to soar, those driving premium brand vehicles that require premium fuel in the tank will be looking for an alternative that will allow them to have a premium sedan that doesn't burn premium gas.	1
	that being said, gas prices could very well push sales of the genesis as it is a 'premium' sedan that can burn regular gas.	1
	once some of those folks have gotten in and taken a ride, they're going to fight the very notion that hyundai actually has produced a very, very nice car.	1
	at some point, they may even catch themselves asking, 'why pay more?'	1

	our store has not done a single lease in the time that i have been here, and the credit analysts that i have spoken with don't even know how to construct one.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1969#msg1969just curious        would any one know the national ratio of the orders for the v6 vs the v8.	1
	i realize it may be too soon to know but wanted to ask                                i know my interest is in the v8 with the tech package and white.	1
	with the tech packages not available yet, the v8 which appears to be in limited supply and the white color not available, may cause us to re think, but i guess i can wait another 30 days to see what shakes out of the trees here in california                                this web site should be mandatory reading for all dealer genesis sales personnel.	1
	it would sure get them current with whats going on nationally and they can even educate their factory rep.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1970#msg1970looking good, imo        i'm an azera owner looking to 'maybe' upgrade to genesis.	1
	from many reviews, it's looking pretty good.	1
	a couple of observations:                                1)  the very weak u.s. dollar has caused the price for foreign products (genesis) to go much higher than expected.	1
	i bet if the dollar would've stayed the same as it was three years ago, the genesis would've been priced at least 2-3k less.	1
	rumors of increasing prices are probably due to the continued decline in the strength of the dollar.	1
	2)  gas may hit $6-7 per gallon by this time next year.	1
	i think we'll see a huge nosedive in sales of large suv, trucks, and luxury vehicles.	1
	in fact we're already seeing it to some degree with gas at $4 per gallon.	1
	i think the genesis will have an initial novelty surge of interest and sales but then falter from the poor u.s. economy and high gas prices.	1
	3)  i would expect the initial price of the genesis to be at msrp or maybe even a little higher through 2008, but then come way down with significant incentives and discounts heading into 2009 when sales start to plummet.	1
	i'm going to cautiously wait until next year before making a final decision.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1971#msg1971re:  [tjc78]        i am in detroit and dealers in my area (i spoke to 3 dealers so far) are expecting the car this week in their showroom.	1
	all have received invoices and order books.	1
	they have told that v6 tech will be available by end july.	1
	on the lease offer, it is going to be valid for next couple of months as part of the launch planned by huyndai.	1
	they said that hyundai is planning the big marketing event as part of their road show planned and the offer should be valid at least till sept end.	1
	the lease on v6 with premium plus is $425 and fully loaded with tech package is around $450.	1
	no news on the v8 package but it should be somewhere around $440 to $500.	1
	i am expecting the test drive the vehicle early next week as this is the long week end.	1
	will keep you updated.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1972#msg1972bad timing        hyundai's timing on the genesis couldn't be worse.	1
	all auto sales were down - especially luxury vehicles, trucks and suvs - even 6 cylinder cars.	1
	the only thing moving was 4 banger fuel sippers.	1
	toyota's sales (toyota!!!)	1
	were down 20% in june, and lexus was down a stunning 22%.	1
	with gas prices definitely going higher, especially over the next month (after that, we may see relief from oil demand destruction - probably after the china olympics), i think those sales figures hyundai had modeled for the genesis are going to be hard to hit.	1
	i've been wrong before.	1
	i agree with the poster who said waiting a year may really pay off, though.	1
	this car may be much cheaper in a year - new.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1973#msg1973re: bad timing [rotary]        otoh, did you notice hyundai/kia sales were up in june, and the azera's sales were relatively flat year-to-year--actually an accomplishment considering plunging sales for competitors like the avalon.	1
	so that could mean that people who do want a luxury sedan will be looking to make every dollar count in the future--both on the price of the car, and on gas (genesis does not require premium whereas many competitors do).	1
	and the genesis has good fe numbers for its class as well.	1
	there are some people who simply want more than a fuel-sipping economy sedan to drive.	1
	sales of luxury sedans is not zero, not close to it, just down from historic levels.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1974#msg1974re: just curious [dave174]        not sure the order placement but hyundai usa is staying with the goal 80/20 between v6 and v8 (80% v6; 20% v8).	1
	the v8 should not be available yet; as hyundai only started v8 production a few weeks ago, so at the earliest mid-july??	1
	v6 started in april for the us market iirc.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1975#msg1975re: bad timing [backy]        i was just going to mention that, as hyundai and kia both did really well in june, and are among the few automakers that had overall uptick trends vs. the same period last year.	1
	30 units of genesis sold                that number is a lot of nothing at this point for interpretation, since dealers are still getting their units allocated, and the full range of genesis trims are still weeks away, at least.	1
	a good start for only a few short days and at limited dealers.	1
	a few dealers i talked to have already and all pre-sold every allocation confirmed/received, so i am still waiting...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1976#msg1976re: bad timing [joe97]        it's amazing even with the hurt on hyundai and kia suv's that their sales are still growing.	1
	this is one of the best years in a while for them even with the terrible first quarter.	1
	hopefully it'll keep improving as their cars get better.	1
	genesis will certainly create some stir as it gets out there.	1
	as it's more of a high ticket, low volume item already, i doubt the sales will be terribly hurt by the current gas prices.	1
	nobody buying a genesis is really in it for the fuel economy, even though it's pretty good for a large rwd.       	1

	or so they say...................                                when the 2006 sonata was introduced, the powder white pearl paint was also about a month behind.	1
	from what i have see, hyundai understands that a pearl paint job has to be perfect or it will not look the part.	1
	they have been willing to wait an extra couple of weeks to make sure that everything is perfect with their new products instead of launching with 'little' problems.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1983#msg1983re:  [tjc78]        i drove the genesis v-6 and thought it to be very nice.	1
	however, i have to agree with those that contend that the genesis will be cross shopped with the avalon (i own a limited and would buy another), the new max, the es350, etc.	1
	the vast majority that would otherwise have the tendency to own a german car or higher end japanese car will not gravitate toward the first-swing korean luxury car.	1
	having said that, cars like the avalon are being heavily discounted - actually being bought below dealer invoice.	1
	that would seeminly leave the genesis flapping in the breeze between the 2 segments.	1
	i'm guessing it will be the lonely stepchild until it is discounted to play with the other very-nice-but-not-top-shelf models......at least until h pay their dues for a few years.	1
	msrp (or close) for a genesis?.......not a snowball's chance after the intial gotta-be-first buyers have them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1984#msg1984        i agree!	1
	in this economy, it's insane to pay msrp (or close to) for a genesis.	1
	i bought my wife a loaded lexus rx350 earlier this year.	1
	we paid invoice!	1
	and that's for the most popular lexus model out there.	1
	i understand that there will be those who want to be the first and would pay premium.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/1985#msg1985i too, test drove a genesis today        so i finally got a chance to go down to a dealer nearby my office (in maryland, in the washington dc area) to test drive the new genesis, i feel compelled to write a review as i know some dealers are posting on this forum, and i really wanted to describe the experience because i have never been to a hyundai dealership before.	1
	i parked my audi allroad 4.2 in the guest lot, walked into the store, and to my surprise, was not greeted by anybody as i walked around for a few minutes.	1
	there was one young sales guy talking to an older couple, obviously busy.	1
	so i knock on the manager's office window, at which time he slowly looked up asked what i wanted, i gestured a 'what's going on'.	1
	he yelled out to one of the offices next to him and an old sales guy eventually emerged asking what i wanted.	1
	i said i wanted to test drive a genesis, and he kinda gave me a foreign look, and literally spent the next 10 minutes getting my license copied and searched various cabinets for the key.	1
	upon walking to the car, he asked if i wanted to 'buy' or 'test drive', i said test drive, because i wanted a genesis with technology package, which no dealers have yet.	1
	it was a premium plus black/black with about 10 miles on it, sitting lonely in the lot.	1
	the sales guy sat in it, fumbled for a while, and he couldn't start the genesis...                he went inside, not even asking me to try, and finally came out with another young sales, who knew more about the car and showed me how to insert key into the slot and press the button.	1
	the older sales said the car's been on the lot for only 2 days.	1
	he then said i can only drive around the block because he doesn't want me to put too many miles on the brand new car with limited allocation.	1
	i instantly gave him a dirty look, because that's the first time i've heard this during a test drive, ever.	1
	the ride was, i have to admit, very nice and the 3.8 engine, suspension, handling all performed beyond my expectation.	1
	i couldn't really test the speakers because the car was very hot having parked outside for so long, the a/c fan was too loud.	1
	as i handed the key over, he didn't bother to show me any features of the car, he said he hasn't been trained.	1
	i asked if i could have a brochure, he said he had none, 'it's that new.'	1
	that dealership has a no-haggle policy, the yellow price tag for their genesis was $350 above msrp, because the sales said it's new and limited allocation.	1
	honestly, i so much wanted hyundai to succeed, because i heard much hype about the car and would love to see another asian brand challenge german made cars.	1
	the genesis itself was indeed nice, but for a few grand more, i can get a nice infiniti and a true luxury car treatment and maintenance service.	1
	next month, i will try another dealership and see if the experience is different.	1
	i still want to get a genesis with tech package.	1
	but if the dealership is similarly poor at customer service or training, i will absolutely reconsider and get a different brand.	1
	what happened to all the mandatory sales training, dedicated sales person who can handle genesis luxury car-like customers?	1
	i'm sooo disappointed and can only hope i went to a poor dealership.	1
	what can i expect from the maintenance service?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1986#msg1986re: i too, test drove a genesis today [bcheng]        wow, your experience brings back memories regarding my azera experiences of 2.5 years ago.	1
	can you imagine anything even close to that happening at a lexus or bmw dealership?	1
	my first hyundai dealership i visited, i was prepared to lease the azera.	1
	i was handed over by the manager to an elderly sales associate who sat very comfortably in his chair behind the desk while i asked questions.	1
	oddly, the manager stood by the door.	1
	every question i asked, the older guy looked confused and looked at the manager who answered for him.	1
	in fact, i don't think the older guy answered any of my questions.	1
	when it came down to lease terms, the manager sat down next to me and we went over all the numbers.	1
	all looked good at that point until he returned with the actual payment.	1
	i asked for the advertised $299 lease deal.	1
	the paperwork he gave me indicated a $550 per month payment.	1
	i asked how that could be so and when i looked more closely at the printout i saw he changed the negotiated terms.	1
	the $1000 rebate that was supposed to be deducted off the cap cost was actually added to the cap cost .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	i kid you not.	1
	and the money factor was higher than what we talked about.	1
	he told me that i'd never get the $299 deal because it would cost the dealerships too much money.	1
	we got into a big argument and he finally told me to get out.	1
	i was so upset over the experience that i called hyundai to report it and they defended the dealer saying that all advertised prices and deals were optional and dealers don't have to abide by them.	1
	anyway .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	don't get me started because i have stories about two other hyundai dealerships that are just as bad.	1
	luckily i did find one that knew what they were doing and i did get the $299 lease deal that i was after.	1
	but it took a lot of time and effort to find.	1
	that's why i think it's a mistake to sell the genesis in the same dealerships as they other hyundai vehicles.	1
	the genesis are selling alongside the accents and the incompetent sales associates are still there.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1987#msg1987re: i too, test drove a genesis today [bcheng]        you should certainly move on from that dealership, given your experience.	1
	sadly there are too many dealers (and                 this goes for almost every brand, luxury and non-luxury brands                ) not knowing how to treat a customer.	1
	i can certainly understand about the pricing (especially at this stage in time), i can even understand more about keeping the miles as low as possible, but in terms of customer experience, at least from your story, this hyundai dealer needs to be stripped of selling the genesis (i don't believe every dealership gets to sell the genesis...)                                just as a fair point, hyundai dealers for the most part, are very good.	1

	worst of all, no test drives at all, and tagged with a 13/18 fuel economy ratings.	1

	a model of the infiniti m35 i was going to buy (might still, in fact - don't ask; had a bad experience regarding the sonata i want - yes, dealer related) was freely given to me for a weekend to drive as much as i wanted by my local infiniti dealer.	1

	[joe97]        no, i wouldn't.	1

	maybe hyundai would be wise to encourage dealers to have a demo, like most other dealerships have?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1992#msg1992re: genesis vs. mercedes e-class review [viking967]        oh well...  it's not as if most people were going to seriously cross-shop genesis and merc/bmw/audi.	1
	a better comparison might have been the genesis against the lexus ls/gs or acura rl.	1
	not the infiniti m, since it's more like a japanese bmw.	1
	the genesis might actually come out ahead when compared to the japanese brands.	1
	but having said that, i feel that the genesis won't be the ground-breaking car the original ls400 was.	1
	that car was more refined, reliable, quieter, had a better ride in addition to being some $20,000-40,000 less comparably equipped than it's rivals, mercedes s and bmw 7.  that car clearly raised the bar, and the germans responded.	1
	they improved their cars significantly on the next generations, in particular, the ride and dealership experience, and made many options standard.	1
	although, one could argue that since the bar has already been raised so high (and still being raised), bmw and mercedes (and lexus),  won't be able to improve their brand so much the second time around.	1
	they can't make their cars significantly better and cheaper as well.	1
	maybe in a few years, hyundai will come out with an even more premium car with more power, refinement, handling, technology for around $50,000 fully loaded.	1
	along with a new brand.	1
	but there is still much uncertainty in the near future for the auto industry and the economy (oil) in general.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1993#msg1993re: nice ride?	1
	[rotary]        a demo would be a good idea, although the cost would be considerable, given that there are few genesis sedans available right now.	1
	this experience brought to mind a similar experience i had a couple of years ago.	1
	i went to my local honda dealer for a special event, an open house in honor of the then-new fit.	1
	the whole point of the event was that the dealer had some fits available to test-drive, and they invited one and all to come in, grab some free food, and drive the fit.	1
	great, i thought, i was interested in the fit at the time and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to drive the different trims, stick and at.	1
	so, two things happened that remind me of this genesis test drive story:                                1) there was a very short test drive course laid out, basically a loop on city streets.	1
	less than 2 miles.	1
	the sales reps were told not to deviate from it.	1
	they accompanied the drivers on every test drive.	1
	reason?	1
	'these fits will probably be sold soon and we don't want to put many miles on them.'	1
	note that the fit is not a $33k+ luxury sedan, but a $14k+ econobox.	1
	2) i knew more about the fit than the sales reps did.	1
	sure, it was a new model for the u.s., but it had been around in other countries for years before and i expected the reps would have been trained on this new model.	1
	note that the fit is considerably less complex than the genesis.	1
	one more thing:  i was unsure after those test drives if the driver's seat would be comfortable.	1
	i suspected from the short drives it would not be, but i really liked the car otherwise so i decided to take one more drive, a much longer one, to find out.	1
	i went to a different honda dealer near me several weeks later to take a test drive.	1
	i was told 'we have no fits for test drives.'	1
	i ran into a similar problem when i tried to test-drive the then-new 2004 prius in the fall of 2003.  a local dealer had no demo for me to drive.	1
	so it is not just hyundai who has these kinds of issues, and not just with luxury cars like the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1994#msg1994re: i too, test drove a genesis today [bcheng]        bcheng...i know of the dealership you're talking about, i bought my '02 sonata there.	1
	when it came time for me to purchase my azera, i went to them first and was treated like a 3rd rate citizen.	1
	my business quickly went to a certain hyundai dealer out in waldorf, md.	1
	it's a smaller store, but the folks there were attentive and made me feel like i was their priority.	1
	p.s.	1
	the service department at the dealership you stopped at, believe it or not, is top notch!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1995#msg1995re: here yet?	1
	[joe97]        i thought the genesis wasn't supposed to be delivered until august.	1
	this seems too early for just a suprise early release.	1
	i think hyundai planned it this way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1996#msg1996re: here yet?	1
	[albook]        the word was always mid-late summer.	1
	as it got closer, the v-6 was to be dropped in july with the v-8 following up in august or september.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1997#msg1997re: here yet?	1
	[allmet33]        my local dealer said, hyundai wants to make sure there are enough units at each dealer by september-when they'll start ad campaign everywhere.	1
	that's why it's at the dealer now, yet it's not widely advertised.	1
	more units will be allocated little by little until sept. so when customers stop by after they saw the ad on tv they won't have problem with supply.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1998#msg1998re: here yet?	1
	[sg2k]        that makes sense.	1
	initially, the dealers were saying they were only going to be allocated 2, no more than 3 genesis vehicles to begin with.	1
	i guess to gauge interest by location and then when the larger shipments come in, the dealers with the greater interest shown...get more cars initially.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/1999#msg1999re: here yet?	1
	[albook]        well, have you been looking at the links posted from actual owners?	1
	anyway, the timeline has always been for june/july release for the v6, and the v8 to follow later.	1
	some dealers received their first shipment mid-to-late june, with most getting their allocations or additional shipments in july.	1
	and it makes sense, since the genesis v6 for the north american market started cranking for production in april (from korea).	1
	v8 had just started about two weeks ago, so we should see them late july/early august (speculative) time frame, which would put it earlier than estimate        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2000#msg2000re: i too, test drove a genesis today [bcheng]        i wanted to throw in some 'other side of the desk' perspective on the horrendous  treatment that i am seeing talked about here.	1
	i am not shocked, but boy am i appalled.	1
	now, i don't know what dealer you were at, but i'm not sure that they have no hope of being successful.	1
	i don't care if they are selling accent's, genesis', or something like toilet paper.	1
	there is no excuse to have a new model on the ground and not have all staff well educated enough on the product to demonstrate it effectively!!	1
	in my store, i have restricted the genesis to my two best sales people.	1
	this is going to be a low volume model, but the people that will be shopping it will have high expectations as to the way they will be treated.	1
	i am amazed at how lazy most people are in this business.	1
	i mean, seriously, how hard is it to go outside and press some buttons, read the manual, and drive the car?!	1
	anyway, in the future, if you don't feel good about the person that you are speaking with at the dealership, ask for another sales person or maybe the sales manager.	1
	don't let someone else's laziness make your experience worse.	1
	now, two other little points.	1
	there are not yet brochures out for the genesis.	1
	that was true.	1
	they should be in within the next couple of weeks.	1
	second, you will read in the fine print of any lease deal from any manufacturer that 'dealer contribution' will affect the final lease terms.	1
	there is a 'suggested' dealer discount from the mfr in all of those teasers.	1
	it is up to the dealer whether they want to participate or not.	1
	i say this only to say that each dealer is not bound to honor those mfr advertisments, but that finding one that will shouldn't be that tough.	1
	one last thing.	1
	if i was joe consumer and i was going to drive a genesis, i would call the dealer first to check availability and then ask to speak with someone that is star certified on the genesis specifically.	1
	this means that the person either attended the same class that i did, or they passed a test on that car.	1
	these people should know something about the car and have some experience.	1
	you can set an appointment to see the car and if they aren't totally brain-dead (which may be asking a lot) they will have the car waiting for you.	1
	there are these morons at every dealership, just try and ask for a sales rep that has been with that dealer for a while (two years or better) and your experience should be better.	1
	i've got one right now that i want to fire every morning that i get to work.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2001#msg2001re: i too, test drove a genesis today [jeffreid]        hey jeffreid, i know of the dealership bcheng spoke of...i'm not surprised.	1
	not to say the whole staff is like that, it sounds like he happend to go in on a day that the knowledgable staff wasn't there.	1
	there's a couple of folks in there that know the hyundai's, but overall...the sales staff isn't top notch.	1
	there is a brochure out for the genesis, but it's not the sales brochure, just the preview brochure.	1
	it really is a shame when a consumer can go into a store and know more about any given vehicle they might be interested in.	1
	i test drove the '07 santa fe and started talking to the salesman about the upcoming veracruz and he looked at me like i was speaking korean.	1
	his exact words were, 'i have no idea that hyundai is coming out with an suv  to be positioned above the santa fe.'	1
	i kid you not.	1
	on the other hand, the service manager at the previously spoken about dealership is very knowlegable (he's been with hyundai since the beginning).	1
	he was the one that put the bug in my ear about the azera when i had my '02 sonata and was getting ready to test drive the '06 sonata.	1
	his exact words were, 'if you like the new sonata, you'll love the new car coming out and it will have more room as well.'	1
	this conversation took place in mid 2005.  i test drove the '06 sonata around august of '05 and then i saw the '06 azera in the showroom by december.	1
	i test drove it in january of '06 and purchased the following month.	1
	at any rate...what i'm saying is, there are good folks and folks that don't know the headlight from the tail light.	1
	so sad!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2002#msg2002re: i too, test drove a genesis today [allmet33]        and let it be known this happens way too often, and similar cases across almost every brand.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2003#msg2003re: i too, test drove a genesis today [joe97]        since being a part of this forum, i'm starting to understand that it's a national problem.	1
	the crazy thing that the 'stores' don't seem to understand is that the sales experience can make or break them.	1
	if a buyer has a good experience, they'll want to bring their business back when they trade up or buy another vehicle.	1
	the same for customer service by the service department.	1
	a great service department can make ownership of something in the econo-box range a pleasant experience.	1
	some 'stores' only care about getting your money out of your pocket and sending you on your way.	1
	please notice i said some, there are plenty that truly do get it and provide customers with the feeling that they do matter.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2004#msg2004re: i too, test drove a genesis today [jeffreid]        once again jeffreid, you are the voice of reason.	1
	i would never let the dealership decide if a car is right for me.	1
	i will buy this car after a test drive (assuming it meets my criteria), regardless of who my sales rep or dealership is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2005#msg2005you sound like a great dealer, jeff        jeff, i appreciate the great information you offer.	1
	you sound like a great dealership to work with.	1
	you mentioned that dealerships have the option to implement advertised lease deals, etc.	1
	and that it shouldnt be hard to find one that will.	1
	however, i found it very difficult and time consuming here in utah.	1
	let me be very specific so people can avoid my awful experience and let me also say, that i did find a wonderful hyundai dealership that was very responsive and great to work with.	1
	but first my horror experiences.	1
	"1)	 westland hyundai in ogden, utah."	1
	avoid.	1
	after initially telling me they certainly will give me the lease deal, they didnt.	1
	they actually added on the $1000 rebate to the cap cost and modified numbers at the end to bring an advertised lease of $299 up to about $550 per month.	1
	they told me that no dealership could do that lease deal because they would lose money.	1
	i knew that wasnt true because i read lots of personal accounts of the lease deal right here on these forums.	1
	i even had printouts from specific experiences.	1
	when i told them and showed them that, they told me that all of them were lying and they asked me to leave and try elsewhere.	1
	they guaranteed i wouldnt find the azera for under $500 on the 27 month lease.	1
	"2)	riverton hyundai  riverton, utah."	1
	avoid.	1
	they are about 45 minutes away.	1
	i called them and talked directly to the person in charge of leases.	1
	i brought up the exact lease deal as specified in on the hyundai site - $299/month.	1
	he said it would be no problem.	1
	i made an appointment to meet the next day.	1
	i drove to the address in the phone book which led me to a huge open field.	1
	i had to call them again to get the correct address (and they had no idea their address was incorrect in the phone book so i pointed it out in the phone book on the counter).	1
	after talking and presenting the lease terms from my printouts, they left me for an unusually long time.	1
	when they came back, they told me that they couldnt get the lease software to work.	1
	they said the lease manager was gone.	1
	(thats the one i made the appointment with).	1
	they said they would have him call me.	1
	i drove back home.	1
	he called me three days later and  i was told the best lease on the azera was around $390 a month.	1
	"3)	ken garff hyundai  salt lake city, utah ."	1
	avoid.	1
	called and made an appointment.	1
	drove there.	1
	within minutes of talking to them i knew something was wrong.	1
	i was negotiating the cap cost, but their numbers were off.	1
	the invoice pricing on the azera (which they showed me in print-out) was about $800 higher than all of the literature, online auto sites, and all of the other hyundai dealerships i visited.	1
	i told them was the correct invoice and retail pricing was and showed them in several papers that i brought.	1
	they told me they were all wrong.	1
	i asked about the other dealerships and they told me they were lying.	1
	then it got worse from there.	1
	they had weird added fees.	1
	for example, they had a dealer name fee of $350.	1
	when i asked them what that was, i was told it was a mandatory fee for the privilege of posting ken garff on the building and vehicles.	1
	it was at this point, that i knew this was a lost cause and i left.	1
	"4)	murdock hyundai  orem, utah."	1
	excellent.	1
	usually i stop after three strikes, but i really wanted to lease an azera.	1
	so, i called murdock hyundai and made an appointment.	1
	it was a 1.5 hour drive.	1
	when i mentioned the lease deal, i was told absolutely.	1
	i didnt even have to negotiate.	1
	$299 a month, plus taxes.	1
	they also had the color i wanted.	1
	done within an hour.	1
	now thats how its done.	1
	perfect.	1
	just out of spite, i emailed westland hyundai in ogden and reminded the sales manager that he guaranteed i couldnt find an azera lease for under $500.	1
	i told him i just lease it for $299 plus tax at murdock hyundai in orem, utah.	1
	i never got a response, obviously.	1
	idiots.	1
	at least i know where to go for my hyundai vehicles, but as you can see, it was not easy to find one.	1
	thats why i was concerned about selling the genesis at regular hyundai dealerships.	1
	i cant even imagine getting a genesis at any of those dealerships that i had awful experiences with trying to lease an azera.	1
	and i know they havent changed much because i get my service at westland hyundai in ogden where i had the awful experience.	1
	(at least their service department is good).	1
	but the last time i was in for service, i waited in the new car lobby.	1
	the secretary was on the phone yelling to someone about divorce papers.	1
	the old man sales guy was in his office sitting in his chair doing nothing.	1
	another one was sitting on the couch next to me drinking coffee and laughing at the show on the television.	1
	i never saw the sales manager.	1
	i was there for almost an hour and they didnt move for the whole hour.	1
	what a job!	1
	i thought they could be researching or reading up on their vehicles or wiping off the dust or taking some for a spin to get better familiar with, but no.	1
	and they will be selling the genesis?	1
	lol       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2006#msg2006re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [ricwhite]        you know, my mom told me once that you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.	1
	now, i don't know if those of you not from the south are familiar with that old addage, but i'm sure it's pretty easy to figure out!!	1
	by the way, thanks for the compliments.	1
	be certain though, there are some people that have bought at my store that think i'm the devil i'm sure.	1
	i do have a certain limit for people just saying crazy stuff or talking down to me like i'm here for their amusement.	1
	i don't have a huge problem with telling someone that feels the need to curse at me or my sales people that we have invested heavily in exit signs for their convenience                                it's just really sorry in my mind to promise someone a price and then change it drasticlly when they arrive.	1
	i know i would be hot!!	1
	to me, the people that are here are the best type of customer you can ask for.	1
	why?	1
	well, if you have been online and found that a particular model meets your needs then you don't have the 60 minutes of 'well, what do you want?	1
	', also, when you are here or on kbb, there are msrp, invoice, and tmv values listed.	1
	print them off and take them with you.	1
	you know what you should be paying from the get go.	1
	it saves the buyer from trying to figure out if the dealer is crazy and it saves the dealer from the 'i want $8000 off on an elantra'.	1
	uh, yeah, i had that two weeks ago.	1
	point is, most people are smart enough these days to figure out how much a car costs.	1
	heck, most websites have payment claculators.	1
	although the default rates are a little low sometimes.	1
	i'm glad to hear that at least one utah dealer can cut through all the b.s.	1
	and just sell the dang car!!!	1
	sounds like you could rack up some referral fees if your friends and neighbors get in the market!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2007#msg2007re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        i went to my local hyundai dealership, dennis hyundai, in columbus to test drive a 2009 sonata limited yesterday.	1
	i've been dealing through e mails with the internet salesman and i spotted a genesis.	1
	he told me he had attended a class for the vehicle and he was very knowledgeable on the genesis and the sonata.	1
	the genesis is a drop dead gorgeous vehicle and i hope it does well for hyundai.	1
	the dealership has really upgraded their sales staff.	1
	not to sound like i have anything against any particular nationality, but they went through a period when they had a great deal of somali immigrants that were extremely high pressure.	1
	i walked away from the place on several different occasions swearing that i will never buy another hyundai again.	1
	i take my current sonata there for service, so i've talked to the newest group of salesmen on several occasions and seen a vast improvement in the quality of the sales practices used.	1
	i hope that i don't offend anyone with my prior comments, but the truth of the matter is the group i previously mentioned would attempt to pressure you into buying right now.	1
	they would continue to follow and pester you as you were walking away and getting in your car to leave.	1
	i don't know if that is a trait or just the way management trained them at the time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2008#msg2008hyundai is not alone        last year, i was shopping for a honda ody.	1
	i got a emailed quote from a dealer an hour away.	1
	before i made the trip, i contacted the honda dealer (norm reeve honda) that is four minutes from my house.	1
	that dealer told me he had the same ody in stock and that he would match the price on it.	1
	once i got there, i found that they did not have it and the dealer would not match the price.	1
	then he proceeded to call me a liar because he claimed the price i was emailed was too low to be true.	1
	a week later he called me and i told him that i was driving around my new honda and at the price he claimed was impossible.	1
	scumbag.	1
	when shopping for a honda pilot, another honda dealer, diamond honda, told me they had the exact color/configuration i wanted.	1
	make the trip over and of course they do not.	1
	once i confronted the salesperson and his manager over their lies, they flat out told me that they will say whatever they need to get me to come over.	1
	two weeks ago, i bought a $60,000 lexus.	1
	again, i had an emailed quote for $6500 off msrp.	1
	i get there and the dealer claims that they have 'never discounted a single penny off the msrp' on the car i wanted.	1
	the one constant i've learned from my dealings with car dealers is that many of them have no problem going from lie to lie.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2009#msg2009re: here yet?	1

	more units will be allocated little by little until sept. so when customers stop by after they saw the ad on tv they won't have problem with supply.'	1
	this seems right in line with what we are seeing.	1
	i have spoken with several dealers in my area here on the east coast.	1
	only two of them have received vehicles (both within the last 5 days), and the others are expecting theirs sometime between this weekend and 2 weeks from now.	1
	in all cases they are only getting one or two vehicles, and none have the technology package.	1
	think about it.	1
	there is still not a brochure available, many dealers have nothing on their websites about genesis,   even on hyundai's own website, under 'build a hyundai', there is no genesis.	1
	you can't build a genesis, you can't see what colors are available, etc.	1
	although you can buy a vehicle now if you get one of the onesie, twosies that are arriving at the dealers, the genesis really isn't officially for sale yet.	1
	the only thing they have officially said is that it would be available this summer, which it is in small numbers and small selection.	1
	mass advertising and sales beginning september seems right in line with all this.	1

	it's certainly understandable that i've encountered the wrong sales person for the test drive, but i also think that a sales manager should never have let this sort of thing happen - poor general sales training and resource allocation.	1
	i did call ahead that same day to ask availability (they had two, one is out in the lot) and they told me to just walk in for the test drive.	1
	basically, i've done nothing to be treated like a third-class citizen, and i'm simply dissappointed and feel sorry for such a dealership in this economy.	1
	'nuff said.	1
	i am still looking forward to a future test drive at another dealership when the tech.	1
	package arrives.	1
	i'm the type of serious buyer that knows what i want, did my homework, and don't need to be persuaded into buying.	1
	so hopefully i just get treated like a customer and erase previous bad experience with hyundai dealership.       	1

	i concluded the opposite.	1
	there is only a $2000 difference between comparably equiped v6 ($40,000) and v8 ($42,000) cars, so i don't understand why anyone wouldn't want to pay the extra $2000 to get the v8.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2014#msg2014re: 8.2 out of 10 [madoka]        basically $2,000 will get you better leather ('ultra premium') , better brakes (4-piston), better steering (electro-hydraulic instead of just hydraulic), a better transmission (zf instead of aisin), illuminated scuff plates and chrome moldings (i'm not sure if this is available on the v6), and 85 more horsepower.	1
	sounds like a bargain.	1
	yet strangely, the v8 isn't that much quicker; certainly not like the difference between the bmw 335i and 328i or 135i and 128i which have only a 70 horsepower difference (between turbocharged and regular engines) but almost a 1.5 second difference from 0-60 (sub 5 second times compared to low 6s even when equipped with automatics).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2015#msg2015its a shame        top of the line entry, trying to get market share and one can not even get the color chart on the hyundai site!!	1
	hyundai, be up front with all interested and all selling the genesis, we can all handle the reality.	1
	if the front end appears broken what could the back end be especially when we that frequent this site know more than the hyundai sales teams in general!!	1
	i must say, that hyundai has much  to learn about product launch especially for their premier product introduction with so much invested.	1
	wonder if anyone from hyundi looks at this site, it would sure be informative for them and their dealer sales teams to view what us buyers are saying.	1
	the genesis  may be good, but is it that good to wait so long and be provided questionable data especially at $42k                                time will tell and a short time for me it will be                                at the beginning a very sincere buyer, now i question my interest       	1

	i dropped by the dealer the next day and no genesi to be seen.	1
	i responded to the e-mail and got something back about how it's important to find out what stage i'm in the buying process with no answer to the complaint about the date of release.	1
	i'm used to upscale dealers and service.	1
	the genesis will be an utter failure if hyundai treats their prospects like carnival marks who shop for a car under p.t.	1
	barnum's big top.	1
	i'll be looking at another dts, the mks, ls, and e350 along with the genesis.	1
	i have no time for sales antics such as i've read here.	1
	on second thought, maybe the whole notion of an upscale hyundai is an oxymoron.	1
	somebody in upper level mgt.	1
	needs to train the dealers to handle upscale customers before the dealers shoot themselves in the foot and the whole genesis program crashes and burns.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2017#msg2017re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [kenb757]        totally agree, you must be ready to launch and that does not only mean the hard product here and there but means the sales and support teams representing the product must be trained properly and ready to go.	1
	thus far my impressions are that hyundai has made a very big tactical error with this pre launch.	1
	no tech package, some colors not available but not known, limited availability, v8 available when?	1
	dealers confused, sales reps confused and most importantly the buying public sees a minor league hyundai launch not a major league bmw, lexus or even infiniti                                would sure be nice if a senior executive at hyundai would respond at this site.	1
	doubtful, as they stay in their ivory towers and look down on us all....                                oh well, it is what it is hyundai, we have choices, do you !!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2019#msg2019re:  [albook]        i'm not sure i would consider my earlier comments to fall under 'unfinished bits and pieces'.	1
	possibly final fit and finish (maybe we are saying the same thing?).	1
	maybe component integration.	1
	other vehicles of lesser cost and lower-to-scale product positioning do not exhibit this.	1
	i don't think h's vision of value-priced luxury slayer (i.e., benz e class) will last - it will end up competing directly with avalons, maximas, es350's, etc.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2024#msg2024re: 8.2 out of 10 [joe97]        turbocharger, schmurbocharger...  i don't think that cars with turbocharged engines are necessarily faster than cars with naturally aspirated engines given similar power, weight and torque.	1
	even twin turbochargers have lag, which all other things being equal would worsen acceleration times.	1
	of course all other things aren't equal, as i can't think of a single n/a car with 300-350 hp (the 335i dynos at over 280 hp at the wheels), 300-350 lb-ft of tq, and around 3,300-3,600 lbs.	1
	maybe only the c5 corvette, and that goes faster than the 135i or 335i.	1
	it is lighter than both cars, although only slightly less than the 135i.	1
	it's also a little more powerful and torquier too, but again only slightly.	1
	maybe we'll see a strange case where the turbo genesis coupe goes almost as fast or even faster than the v6 genesis coupe, despite having 87 less horsepower.	1
	anyway, if the 328i and the 3.8 genesis are the baselines, and both cars have similar performance, although the 328i is more efficient (230hp/200tq compared to 290/264, but about 350 less lbs), then the 335i engine really overachieves compared to the the tau engine.	1
	the power to weight/torque to weight numbers are very close (much closer than the 328i and 3.8 genesis), but the performance numbers are considerably different.	1
	the real issue might be traction-related, since the quarter mile trap speeds are much closer than the actual finish times (around 105.x to 103.something).	1
	i have now completely digressed from my original point that while the v8 genesis is only $2,000 more than the v6, it is apparently well worth it considering the upgrades (leather, brakes, engine, transmission, steering).	1
	however, this particular engine upgrade seems not like much of an upgrade compared to other engine upgrades from other car manufacturers.	1
	you probably get as much of an upgraded performance (acceleration) from an acura tl-s over the base tl which is just a slightly larger v6, as you do from the 4.6 tau than the 3.8 lambda in the genesis.       	1

	fwiw, the tau 4.6 is a very good first try by hyundai, 375hp, and more importantly 17/25 mpg - this is as good as you can get.	1
	some of the v6 in this class comes in with the same, or lower fuel economy rateings, let alone a v8.	1
	as for the 0-60 time in the v8: 5.6- 5.7 secs from some of the reviews i've seen - why are we making it as a bad thing?	1
	yeah, let's put this and race it with the 3er.	1
	anyway, everyone having driven the v8 so far had nothing but good things to say about it.	1
	personally, i can't wait to drive the genesis.	1
	this is the first hyundai where you can truly say they've executed the car right on just about every area - name it, done deal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2027#msg2027re: long comprehensive review [akuma]        quote from that review:                  if you're keeping track, you've already figured out that driving off in a fully loaded genesis v-6 will cost you $40,000.	1
	that's why i'm on the fence about either a sonata or a m35.	1
	it may seem like an odd choice, but if i go big, i can get a loaded m35, which is consumer reports #1 ranked luxury car - they even rank it higher, with a near perfect score (98 out of 100, i believe) than the bmw 7 series, lexus ls460, and mercedes s550 - all cars costing $30,000 to $60,000 more - for a mere $1,430 more than a loaded genesis v-6.	1
	and i wouldn't just rely on that statement by cr or any other publication.	1
	i've driven the m35.	1
	i have also driven or driven in both the s class and  7 series, too.	1
	the infiniti is better, imo, also.	1
	the infiniti is a proven quantity, with an amazing interior, great handling, available in awd, with an excellent reliability rating, and the dealers give you true white glove treatment.	1
	why would i not buy it over a genesis when it's merely 3% more?	1
	that's why the genesis is less the value proposition people first thought, rightly or wrongly.	1
	my local dealers don't even have any in stock, not that i'm seriously considering purchasing one.	1
	whatever else that can be said, one thing i know for sure - hyundai is terrible at launching a supposed premium car, and will be taken less and less seriously the longer they allow the types of experiences i'm reading about here happen.	1
	i want hyundai to succeed, because competition is good, and fear that they're going to fall flat on their face with this car.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2030#msg2030re: long comprehensive review [rotary]        if you can really get a loaded m35 for around $41,000, that would also make it around $10-20k less than it's competition's msrp (bmw 5, merc e, lexus gs, or audi a6 comparably equipped).	1
	however, in this current economy, msrp means nothing.	1
	even mercedes and audi (and soon bmw and lexus) are selling near or below invoice right now.	1
	it's still a very good deal, considering the invoice of the m35 is over $41,000, and with the tech package it's around $44,000, althought the tmv is actually just under $45,000.	1
	so it looks like that dealer is throwing another $2,500 on the hood to sell it.	1
	if no one is biting on that deal, i really do wonder if people are going to bite on the genesis.	1
	at least for msrp.	1
	already people are buying it for $500-1000 under.	1
	then again, the v8 genesis is only $2,000 more with similar fuel economy to the m35, and cheaper than the m45 by around $10,000 (tmv).	1
	i hate to sound like a broken record, but the real genesis value is in the v8.	1
	infiniti, lexus, audi, bmw, mercedes all charge between $6-10k more just for the larger engine.	1
	heck, even cadillac charges over $2,000 more just for a direct injection version of their v6.	1
	hyundai could have charged about $1,500 less for the v6 and $1,500 more for the v8, and the v8 would still be a good value compared to its competition.	1
	the upgraded leather and brakes/rotors alone are worth around $1,500, and $3,000 isn't unreasonable for 85 more horsepower.	1
	the v6 then would be more of a no-brainer at $31,500 (msrp).	1
	incidentally, when the m35 first came out, it was an excellent value compared to the competition.	1
	the m35 (not the m45) and the acura rl (acura is still considered a value luxury brand, infiniti somewhat, and lexus used to be) are probably the only cars in the segment (arguably premium luxury) that can touch the genesis' value (the v6).	1
	yet no one's buying the rl, even when almost fully loaded 2008s are selling at $41,000.	1
	$44,000 with the overpriced tech package (navigation, rear camera, adaptive lights).	1
	i guess you could throw in the cadillac cts as well, which sells fully loaded and with almost identical equipment as the genesis for around $41,000, $43,000 with direct injection (2008 tmv).	1
	but at the end of the day, my suggestion is to buy what you really want (or need, in the case for the sonata) and live with the results.       	1

	i have to agree with the views that hma is horrid at new car lanuches.	1
	most mfrs will advertise a new model to the point of overkill and then have some hype and/or waiting lists in place when the units start to hit the ground.	1
	hyundai always does the opposite.	1
	they put a commercial on during the super bowl.	1
	in feburary.	1
	then we get cars in july.	1
	no marketing and no hype.	1
	the idea of a premium drivers car to me would be to have people waiting at the dealership when the cars get there.	1
	not have people looking at a half-a**ed roll out and then wanting to know where the most popular item (white w/tech) is.	1
	by the way, a 2009 sonata 4cyl auto  invoices at around $19400.	1
	less a $500-$600 holdback and a $2000 rebate.	1
	that looks like a $16800 deal if you get the dealer to strip out all front end money.	1
	if you can buy one for under $15k, uh, go get it yesterday.	1
	as to the genesis launch, the posts that quote a $80 million ad budget are accurate.	1
	hopefully by august when we have all of the packages on the ground and v8 cars around the corner then the masses will be aware of the car.	1
	most people that i speak to have never heard of this ride.	1
	matter of fact our shirt guy thought that the genesis was a different brand of car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2048#msg2048re: you have it wrong, joe [joe97]         which one is it?	1
	you have three cars on the board (g35 newly added), in three different pricing segment, make it more clear with regards to the details, specs, trims, prices, please...                                    fwiw, i contacted the nearest infiniti dealer, asked for the best price they would offer me on a loaded m35, ~53k.	1
	for a car your dealer has no available units, 7k off msrp?	1
	wow.	1
	this is infiniti?	1
	ps: couldn't resist this forum - addictive, isn't it?	1
	it's not a 'loaded' m35, as i've said three times now.	1
	also, there are two of us, in this very thread, that have gotten written quotes of basically under 42k.	1
	i have no idea what you're talking about with a 53k loaded infiniti m35.	1
	i said the base m35 is already pretty much 'loaded.'	1
	the msrp on the m35 i was quoted is $43,900.	1
	edit - okay, you know it wasn't me who said anything about a loaded g35.	1
	thanks.	1
	joe, you are right that i bashed the suspension of the genesis based on articles i've read, when that's unfair.	1
	i haven't even drive it yet.	1
	i won't make any more comments about the genesis until and unless i drive one.	1
	jeff, i posted the name of the dealership that quoted me the sonata gls price earlier in this thread.	1
	backy asked me to, and i obliged.	1
	and yes, i qualify for a lot of the rebates.	1
	they have ads all the time in the dallas morning news, and are located in terrell, tx.	1
	see here:                 http://shopping.dallasnews.com/rop/ads.aspx?advid=320706adid=6559203type=                                i really have no reason to bash hyundai for anything but a miserable product launch regarding the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2049#msg2049re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        there are some hyundai dealers (see the sonata prices paid discussion for details) who routinely lop around $2000 off invoice on sonatas                 before                rebates.	1
	i am not sure how they can do that, unless they are getting special incentives from hma, but rest assured it is                 possible                to get a sonata gls at that stickers for $20k for under $15k, especially if one qualifies for the loyalty rebate or other special rebate (military, graduate).	1
	but you might have to drive/fly a bit to get that kind of deal.	1
	i am wondering what kind of deals these low-priced dealers will offer on the genesis once supply ramps up?	1
	but anyway, cross-shopping a base sonata with a car like the genesis is, uhm, interesting to say the least.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2050#msg2050re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        looks like either way, hyundai is going to cause pain to some people.	1
	some here wondered why it was going to take hyundai usa such a long time to release the genesis after the super bowl ad teasers, which by the way, the results of the ads were terrific.	1
	i'd give your merc glk's release schedule, this is nothing new.	1
	on the other hand, now the product is here at some dealers, it's still bad news.	1
	to my knowledge, hyundai usa has always done some small scale pre-sale prior to the launch of a vehicle.	1
	i'd say let's wait until the product is officially launched and then make a proper determination.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2051#msg2051re: you have it wrong, joe [rotary]        sorry the other person said it was a loaded m35 - 'i have negotiated a deal with a fully loaded m35 at $42k.'	1
	i went back to the posts - i mixed up the two.	1
	sorry.	1
	the msrp on the m35 i was quoted is $43,900.	1
	but how can you compare a base m35 to a loaded genesis v6?	1
	by the way, the genesis v6 starts at 33k, including shipping/delivery.	1
	i'm a nissan 'spy,'                                i corrected myself, and you should too.	1
	look back in the posts, i never once called you a spy, that wasn't me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2052#msg2052joe        i edited my post to clear up some of the confusion, per your request.	1
	thanks.	1
	i was comparing the base m35 to the loaded genesis v6, which i admitted, has more features than the m35.	1
	so in that respect, you're right.	1
	the base m35 and base genesis are 10k apart.	1
	this will be my last post regarding the genesis.	1
	i have nothing to add that's constructive because i haven't driven it, and it would be unwise to make any more comments, good or bad, about the car itself, unless i did.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2053#msg2053re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        i am sure that there are plenty of 'teaser' ads out there and plenty of examples of under invoice deals out there.	1
	there are also plenty of real world people that happened upon exceptional pricing.	1
	as a sceptic of 'crazy' pricing (by that i mean complete money losing deals), i would contend that in most cases the selling dealer is making most of the loss back on finance reserve (rate markup) or underbooking a trade (appraisal at $5000, allowing $4000 e.g.).	1
	also, when i was in las vegas last year, i saw a planet hyundai ad that had prices on accent and elantra that i couldn't believe.	1
	when i asked the hyundai reps what the story was they informed me that nevada has no limit to what you can charge for a doc fee.	1
	so you get an accent for $5995, but you pay a $3000-$4000 doc fee!!	1
	anyway, there are just some things that i feel like are mitigating factors on some of these deals.	1
	i'm not a rocket scientist (although i was a physics major in college...) but if you sell a product for less than you pay for it then you are going backwards.	1
	there has to be somewhere to make up the difference.	1
	all i'm saying is that i would be curious to see the final contract or sales slip when all of the fees and such come to bear.	1
	if you have to drive or fly to get the great deal, then how much have you spent on gas or air fare?	1
	also, how much of your time have you spent?	1
	many times the difference isn't worth the other factors.	1
	as i said once before, take your tmv info into the dealer and make a deal from there.	1
	you should be able to make a deal that you and the dealer will both benefit from in less than an hour.	1
	no headaches, no stress, no travel.	1
	just a thought.	1
	hope everyone had a great fourth!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2054#msg2054re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]         if you have to drive or fly to get the great deal, then how much have you spent on gas or air fare?	1
	i may have special circumstances, but because i frequently fly for my job, air fare or gas would likely cost me nothing.	1
	as to whether it's worth one to 1.5 days of my time to save $1000-2000+, well, i would say it is.	1
	and from                 very                recent experience, i have found it takes much more than an hour (try                 days                ) to week out the best deal from local dealers.	1
	there is huge variation, even when they are all quoting from supposedly the same manufacturer-subsidized finance programs   so it could actually take me                 less                time to get a price through the internet, fly to my business trip, and on the way home pick up my new car.	1
	anyway, there's all kinds of talk on this subject in the hyundai (especially sonata and elantra) prices paid discussions, including stories about legit dealers who routinely advertise and honor internet prices well under invoice (and way, way under tmv) before rebates.	1
	hopefully someday soon we'll be able to have these kinds of discussions, about big discounts, on the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2055#msg2055re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        i'm sure that all of your points are legit.	1
	i guess i was just saying that the difference in time spent and savings of frustration to make a good and fair deal on a car or furniture or whatever may well be just as good as spending days or weeks searching all over the usa trying to see what the greatest deal anywhere is.	1
	just saying.	1
	if you pay invoice minus incentives, did you get hosed?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2056#msg2056re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        on a genesis, right now--no.	1
	on a car like the sonata that i know i can get for about $2000 under invoice before rebates, i would have gotten pretty wet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2057#msg2057re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        since it's off subject, i won't post on this anymore, but......                                i wasn't saying that you couldn't find a better deal than invoice or that the guy next to you at the supermarket didn't find a car for less somewhere else.	1
	all i was saying was that buying a new car at invoice is something that most dealers will be ok with on most models and that it would not be an unfair price for the consumer.	1
	it just seems that many people make buying a car a weeks or months process just to try and squeeze every penny out of the process when they could get what they want in an hour and still get a price that is fair to them and the dealer.	1
	b/c the dealer (just like any other retailer) should get an fair shake on the transaction as well.	1
	by the way, i have sold three cars under invoice today, so i'm really just making a point to be making a point.	1
	right or wrong.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2058#msg2058re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        ah, that explains it--you are a car salesman!	1
	no wonder you think buying at invoice is a good deal.	1
	last time i checked, no one forces dealers to offer internet prices at well under invoice.	1
	if they did not think they are getting a 'fair shake' on the deal, then i assume they would not freely offer those kinds of prices.	1
	so back on topic... i suppose you would also think it is fair for dealers to set prices on the first few genesis sedans to over msrp, if that is what the market will bear.	1
	i haven't seen anyone offer a genesis (or anyone buy a genesis) at or near invoice yet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2059#msg2059re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        not sure on the salesman comment.	1
	i have made it very clear that i am a sales manager at a hyundai dealer.	1
	i did not feel that i was decpetive in any way.	1
	well, the answer to the genesis pricing question is this.	1
	if $1 or $1,000,000 over msrp is the market value of the car then so be it.	1
	it is obvious that most consumers believe that under msrp is fair, then why would over msrp not be fair if that was the market value?	1
	people pay full price for sony playstation 3's all day long.	1
	when they first came out, they were on ebay for $1,000's of dollars.	1
	these things are $499.	1
	didn't that make the market value of a ps3 well over it's msrp?	1
	who was saying that $501 was immoral for that product?	1
	we live in a free market economy, and some products have prices that are not set in stone.	1
	if a retailer has to discount a product to sell it, then so be it.	1
	if a retailer can charge a premium for a product, then good for them.	1
	again, i am not saying that shopping price is wrong.	1
	i'm not saying that getting an under invoice deal is wrong or unfair.	1
	my point was very simple.	1
	buying a new car at invoice is generally a fair price.	1
	one at which the comsumer comes out with a fair price and the dealer makes a fair profit.	1
	it also should make the buying process very simple and stress free.	1
	it just seems that most of the 'i hate car dealers' is because the 'i want to buy the car for a nickel less if i can find it somewhere' mentality rules.	1
	this adds stress to the buying process and in general makes the whole thing less pleasant for the consumer and the retalier.	1
	if one chooses a car that they want and can get a discounted price down to invoice and then take off applicable rebates then they got the car they wanted for a reasonable cost and without the headache.	1
	sorry i opened a can of worms.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2060#msg2060re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [jeffreid]        if someone wants to spend a lot of time and get a lot of stress trying to save a nickel, that's their business.	1
	i don't have that kind of time, but i don't mind spending some time trying to save several hundred dollars, or even more.	1
	but there should be no reason that the relationship between bargain-hunters and dealers can't be civil, and business-like.	1
	as you  know, if someone wants a stress-free buying experience, there's plenty of dealers that offer no-haggle pricing, and at least in some cases the reps aren't on commission.	1
	very stress-free.	1
	unless you trade in your car, that is... but that is                 really                another topic.	1
	there's at least one auto manufacturer that has no-haggle pricing across the board.	1
	but it isn't hyundai.	1
	and yes, you did open a really big can of worms.	1
	so let's close it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2061#msg2061re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        agreed.	1
	by the way, we agree on every point you have made.	1
	every person has the right to choose how to spend his/her time and money.	1
	we can simply see the same situation from two different angles.	1
	to those of you that have purchased a genesis, how are you liking your car?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2062#msg2062re: joe [rotary]        a few posts ago you said you were done commenting here.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2063#msg2063couple of questions:        does the genesis come with fold down rear seat for long truck items such as skis or snowboards?	1
	any new lease deals been announced for summer/fall on the genesis?	1
	also, jeff mentioned that paying 'invoice' price is fair for both the dealer and the consumer.	1
	is that because the dealer still makes money on hold-backs, fees, or what?	1
	when i bought my azera, i had a really hard time negotiating down the price to even $500 above invoice.	1
	one dealership was selling above msrp.	1
	the others were over $1000 over invoice.	1
	i finally found one that offered me $700 over invoice -- which i took.	1
	i know that pricing is based on supply and demand, but in the market we are in today, i can't see how the 'demand' will be very high -- especially for larger luxury type vehicles (except initially when it's in the novelty stage).	1
	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2064#msg2064re: couple of questions: [ricwhite]        there's a hole for skis or snowboards when you fold down the arm rest.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2065#msg2065re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [backy]        well, i finally test drove the genesis v6 (premium plus package) today.	1
	to sum it up:  i was impressed.	1
	hyundai certainly has come a long way.	1
	the v6 engine was smooth and responsive.	1
	the ride was refined and impressively quiet.	1
	however, i could see hyundai cutting corners here and there.	1
	the steering column didn't have a luxurious feel to it.	1
	the 'simulated' wood trim looked... very fake.	1
	at the dealer i went to, the genesis v6 had a 'market adjustment' of $2500.	1
	the reason given was that the car is very new and is very much in demand.	1
	funny!	1
	the dealer had the cars for two days and had not sold a single one yet.	1
	i wished them luck.	1
	hey, if they feel that is the market value for these cars, so be it.	1
	i'm going to wait to test drive the v8 and the tech package.	1
	hopefully, the v8 provides a little more 'kick' on acceleration.	1
	for those comparing/shopping infinity and genesis, you can get a loaded pre-owned (navigation, etc) 2007 infinity m45 sport for the price of a 'pre-market adjustment' premium plus genesis v6.	1
	i just throw it out to show what the genesis is up against in the price-range that it's playing in.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2066#msg2066re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [dueho]        seems 'market adjustments' happen more often than not.	1
	on one hand, you'd have normal markup in the luxury, extoic, halo segements.	1
	genesis market adjustment in the pre-sale period is expected, until they have sufficient units.	1
	if you'd think this is a crazy, a local fl dealer is selling a challenger srt-8 with 15k markup, with no test drives.	1
	on the other side of the spectrum, and this is a new one, now small cars are, all of the sudden more in demand than ever before.	1
	for example, i brought my cousin car shopping today.	1
	she's looking for a small econ vehicle.	1
	she really likes the civic, so that was our first stop, at the local dealer, to my surprise, $3,000 markup, next closest dealer, same thing, also markup on the fit as well.	1
	supply and demand, supply and demand...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2067#msg2067re: couple of questions: [ricwhite]         any new lease deals been announced for summer/fall on the genesis?	1
	there is a $399/mo introductory lease special available in most markets (v6)       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2068#msg2068re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [joe97]        you might know this already.but i just want to tell in brief.	1
	hyundai invited a bunch of american auto journalist to its home ground -namyang located in suburban area of seoul, korea - in may and held some comparison test drive event for them.	1
	i never heard that american journalists were invited to korea for the launch of 'a' new car.	1
	this is not trivial.	1
	hyundai must pay all the flights, accomomdations, and other treats for that pre-sale.	1
	i know this would not be enough to grab full attention from the masses in the us.	1
	but, anyway, it seems sure that the genesis is also special to hyundai itself compared to other vehicles of its own.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2069#msg2069thanks        thanks for the responses regarding the lack of fold-down seats and the lease deal.	1
	regarding the 'market adjustment'  (which is also called 'additional dealer profit') --  just wait six-eight months after the novelty period is over.	1
	most large luxury cars will be heavily discounted.	1
	gas will be $5.50/gal and rising.	1
	other costs will be gong up.	1
	paid raises will stagnate.	1
	people will be delaying auto purchases until they know the economy and oil prices are stabilizing.	1
	then they will be likely looking for smaller more economical vehicles.	1
	that $2500 'market adjustment increase' will be a $2500 'decrease.'	1
	they'll probably throw in a $500 gas card to boot.	1
	on a positive note, i am pleased to read some very positive reviews.	1
	i'm pulling for hyundai to do well with the genesis.	1
	i'm in the 'what should i do' mode right now.	1
	my azera is only 2.5 years old and has only 20,000 miles.	1
	but i do like the genesis.	1
	i'm worried about gas prices and other increasing costs, however, so i'm starting to think i should wait until next spring or so.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2070#msg2070re: you have it wrong, joe [joe97]        $53,000 for a loaded m35?	1
	hmmm... is that a 2008 or 2009?	1
	i don't even think the 2009s are out yet.	1
	because according to the price calculator on edmunds, a m35 with tech package (loaded very similar to a loaded genesis) is $44,814 (chicago area adjustment -$293).	1
	roughly $3,200 off msrp, and about $820 over invoice.	1
	many dealers are willing (but many don't as well) to honor edmunds' tmv pricing.	1
	it will only go lower when the 2009s come out pretty soon.	1
	this isn't a truly loaded car.	1
	that would be $50,417 for one equipped with the premium package.	1
	which still isn't loaded, because the premium package can't be combined with the sport package (which isn't available at all on the genesis).	1
	also the premium package includes many options that aren't available at all currently on the genesis such as lane departure prevention, intelligent cruise, dvd players/screens in the front and back, rear heated and reclining seats.	1
	the tech package does include navigation with rearview monitor and a premium bose sound system, but doesn't have the power sunshade or 'super-premium' sound system (both available on the premium package).	1
	so you can get a comparably equipped car from a 'luxury' make within a few thousand dollars of the genesis (at msrp).	1
	i also mentioned in a previous post the 2008 rl and cts too.	1
	the 2009 rl is quite improved though.	1
	someone else said that the rl was just a gussied accord, but as a previous legend owner, the accord (any generation) is no legend (or rl).	1
	all those cars are still a few thousand dollars more (tmv), but you get consistently better dealer service, and a bit more 'prestige' (however much that might be worth to someone).	1
	so the genesis doesn't appear to be quite the slam dunk (pricing wise) as many people might think.	1
	then again, a year or two later, with discounts and model updates, who really knows?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2071#msg2071re: you have it wrong, joe [akuma]        i was just trying to get a feel how much a loaded m35 my local dealer would sell me for.	1
	as you may know, this has been (somewhat) of an ongoing discussion, where one of the posters said he had negotiated a price of 42k for a loaded m35.	1
	so called up the dealer, and asked for a loaded m35 - got the following spec available on the lot: m35 with premium package, plus 18-in polished wheels with splash guards - $55,490 (msrp), a little under 53k was the price offered.	1
	of course, if i was remotely interested (and if i was, i would have probably waited for the next gen m anyway), i would certainly try to get the price further down a little.	1
	after the fact, i also found out there was factory cash available the dealer neglected to mention, that weasel                                anyway, back to the genesis...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2072#msg2072re: 8.2 out of 10 [joe97]        curious how my post regarding two product features available on azera that are not available on genesis are 'unbelievable' and 'exactly the same', in your words.	1
	did it occur to you though that                 other posters                here were unaware of those omissions?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2073#msg2073re: 8.2 out of 10 [dborth]        actually, there were quite a bit of discussions not long ago on here, over a good number of posts on the two items.	1
	all i was saying, we heard you loud and clear the first time around...                                go ask hyundai as to the reason (i think i have a pretty good idea though) but this is certainly not going to make me wanting to experience this car any less.	1
	this is the first hyundai product where i am seriously considering, and probably not the last (hint hint genesis coupe).	1
	truth to be told, we all wish for the 'perfect' car (insert vehicle here), and all of the features we want, and deletion of those we don't, but unfortunately it doesn't work like that.	1
	some vehicles may come close, some vehicles may actually hit the sweet spot for some demographic but not others - this is not an one size fits all kind of deal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2074#msg2074re: you sound like a great dealer, jeff [allthatblue]        agreed.	1
	i was taken by surprise when the major us auto journalists were invited out there.	1
	without much saying, hyundai is taking this vehicle seriously.	1
	another press event was held late june in santa barbara, ca to test the genesis, and more specifically, the north american versions of the vehicle, along with its competitors hyundai usa brought along for the event.	1
	after reading numerous reviews from the us journalists on both tests, the biggest difference i came away with is the suspension setup.	1
	clearly the na spec was made and catered to the na market, and everyone had good things to say about it - a hyundai with its handling as one of the strong points        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2078#msg2078re: couple of questions: [ricwhite]        to answer the question about invoice price being fair:  yes, a dealer still makes a nice profit even if it sells a car at invoice.	1
	there're dealer incentives, dealer rebates, and holdbacks to add to the profit column.	1
	anything above invoice is a bonus.	1
	invoice is just an arbitrary number that basically guarantees profit for the dealer.	1
	it is not a true dealer cost.	1
	auto manufacturers and dealers are getting smarter in dealing with internet-age consumers.	1
	regarding market adjustment, it is determined by supply and demand.	1
	if dealers feel that the demand exceeds supply, they will jack up the price to adjust for it.	1
	there will be some consumers who want to be the first and pay the premium price.	1
	an analogy with the game consoles is a good one.	1
	and anyone shopping for a wii last holiday season would know.	1
	if you don't like market adjustments on cars (and i don't), your options are to wait for more supply to meet/exceed demand or to look elsewhere.	1
	don't fall in love with one particular car or you'll pay more than others for it.	1
	add the price adjustment to the car and shop for comparable cars.	1
	even consider pre-owned (within 2-3 years).	1
	these are attractive since someone else has taken the biggest hit on depreciation.	1
	there are plenty of premium cars coming off lease.	1
	just look around.	1
	just remember:  you, the consumer, and the dealer combine to set the market value for a vehicle.	1
	the dealer can set their initial price (expecting the consumers to be willing to pay for it).	1
	but if they don't get a response from the consumers, they'll drop their price and/or offer incentives to move it off the lot.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2079#msg2079re: couple of questions: [dueho]        just wanted to say that 'dueho' hit the nail on the head in terms of the supply and demand comments.	1
	i personally think that the 'market adjustments' are kind of stupid.	1
	they were out there on the first santa fe as well, and if the market supports it, then ok. however, as i saw mentioned here earlier, if an item is selling that well, it wouldn't be sitting in inventory now would it..............                                all items that are bought/sold in this country have their values determined at the point of sale.	1
	all things are worth what someone else is willing to pay for them.	1
	this goes for cars and sneakers.	1
	joe consumer is willing to pay $xx,xxx for a sonata/genesis/m35 and when that cash trades hands the value of the product is established between that buyer and that seller.	1
	same thing goes for a dealer taking a car in on trade or a guy buying a hamburger.	1
	there really isn't any difference.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2080#msg2080genesis launch issues        i don't think the genesis will be formally launched until hyundai gets enough models into the dealers and they actually have the tech package ready.	1
	hopefully then we'll see a lot of marketing to push the vehicle.	1
	i don't expect this to happen for another 1-2 months.	1
	i think that's fine to trickle in early models for hardcore people and then do a general push later.	1
	i just hope for a much bigger push than the azera...which was a whimper at best!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2081#msg2081absolutely stunning!!!	1
	i got to see the genesis from a distance when it was here for the dc auto show.	1
	the car hyundai brought to thes how was burgundy with brown interior.	1
	i thought it looked nice then...                                friday, i stopped by my local hyundai dealer to see if they had any genesis sedans on the lot.	1
	i pulled around the back side of the building...lo and behold, there it was.	1
	now i thought the burgundy one at the auto show was nice, but the black one sitting on the lot was absolutely stunning!!!!	1
	it was a black 3.8 w/technology package and the window sticker was $36k.	1
	the interior was black with the brown leather dash.	1
	of course, it being the only one they had...i couldn't take it for a test drive.	1
	i asked him when he thought he would have more coming in so i could take one for a spin and he told me in about a week.	1
	i truly can't wait, the car is simply beautiful from any angle you look at it.	1
	i truly hope hyundai does everything it can to market this car the way it should be, it has all the potential in the world to be the car that changes everything for hyundai.	1
	however, this is just my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2082#msg2082re: absolutely stunning!!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2083#msg2083re: i too, test drove a genesis today [bcheng]        bcheng...you're absolutely right.	1
	you would think the sales manager would stay on top of something like that, as ultimately it's something that hurts the bottom line...sales.	1
	it's funny how sale driven a dealership is and yet, the one thing they don't pay attention to is customer service.	1
	personally, if i were a manager, i would create an atmosphere that would make a customer want to be there, want to inquire about my vehicles, want to test drive them and ultimately...want to buy one.	1
	it really trips me out that the one area a lot of dealerships lack in, is the one that would bring them better business.	1
	then again, maybe they're doing so well that they don't care if they sell cars or not.	1
	nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...that can't be it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2087#msg2087re: need v8 features clarification [netaddict]        when you step up to the v8, you do get all of the extras that you have mentioned here, plus you get to step up to the zf tranny, which from what i understand is a pretty premium transmission.	1
	also, there will be v8 only wheels.	1
	now i know that the info listed online doesn't say this, but i was shown a pic of three sets of wheels for this car at our training show and was told which one was base v6, upgraded v6, and v8 wheels.	1
	there are a couple of other extras such as illuminated scuff plates, some exterior chrome (which i thought looked really nice), electrochromic exterior mirrors, and a wood and leather steering wheel.	1
	this info is taken straight off of my order guide, which i have been told is accurate.	1
	seeing as how it has invoice amounts and package prices, it should be correct.	1
	i'm with most of the other posters here, i would be all over the v8 for $2k more.	1
	i was told by one of the guys at my training session that he was using a v8 model for an airport shuttle and had been averaging about 24-25 mpg highway with it.	1
	i thought that sealed the deal.	1
	375 horses and the tech pkg for $42k.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2089#msg2089        the official record indicates that 30 genesis had been already sold in us during june.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2091#msg2091re: need v8 features clarification [netaddict]        jeffreid is right,                                besides the engine, zf's transmission is also recognized as more premium product than aisin's(equipped in v6).	1
	with a more poweful engine and a more quick and precise gearbox, you could get more agile responsiveness in result(as you are aware of, v8 is 0.5 sec.	1
	quciker than v6 in 0 to 60mph test reported recently.)	1
	this is the major difference you can get for extra 2k(or more?)	1

	very, very informative!	1
	just one question: how is it possible to buy something that you're not in love with?	1
	i mean, i'm not the type of guy who aims to be the first to own something, but i usually base my buying decisions on how well it would meet my needs, the price and the emotion.	1
	any advice for someone like me who likes relatively rare trims like a (nearly) fully loaded manual transmission model?	1
	is it still possible to negotiate a good price for a car that may have to be ordered from the factory?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2094#msg2094re: couple of questions: [blackadder5639]        of course we don't want to buy things that we don't like/love.	1
	what i mean is that don't just lock on to one specific car.	1
	have other options to fall back upon and be ready to walk away.	1
	if asked, mention that you're looking at other cars as well, even lower priced ones with less features.	1
	(so, they don't tell you how much value you get buying this car compared to more expensive cars when you already know it).	1
	tell them a list of cars that you're looking at or plan to look at.	1
	but if you're so set on one car, don't ever let the salesman know you're in love with it.	1
	if he knows you can't live without it, you'll end up on the losing end throughout the buying process.	1
	don't even tell him you really like the car.	1
	just say that it's nice, but... and find 'problems' to pick on, even if those problems are subjective (hard to argue with).	1
	make it sound like you have to compromise (with your needs/emotions) to buy this car.	1
	'yeah, that option is nice.. but i don't really need it!'	1
	the rule of thumb is: the more (positive) emotion you show, the more you'll pay.	1
	make it sound like you're buying a pair of work pants.	1
	another thing salespeople tend to ask (and they almost always do) is when you are looking to buy.	1
	don't tell them you need a car tomorrow or next week (even if you do).	1
	keep them interested by saying you're in the market (i.e.	1
	serious about buying) but are flexible and will buy once you find the 'right' car.	1
	they will try to convince you that the car you're looking at is the 'right' car.	1
	yeah, but does it have the 'right' price?!	1
	they don't want you to go somewhere else to find the right car.	1
	the dealers know that the moment you (the serious buyer) walk out that door, it's a potential loss sale, even if you already agree on everything and just want to bring your wife back to see it.	1
	that's why they invent all sorts of tactics to keep you in the dealership.	1
	talk about those tactics, they like to 'beat you up and wear you down' while you're in there.	1
	people tend to make less sound judgement when they're pressured, in a hurry, or tired.	1
	even wonder why you have to wait a long time for the sales manager to approve a 'proposed' price?	1
	once and a while, the sales manager would come out and try to close the deal.	1
	if you're not ready, just tell them staight up that you don't make decisions 'on the spot'.	1
	as for custom order from the factory, i'd stay away from that.	1
	you're unlikely to get a good price if you custom order from the factory.	1
	as with anything rare/limited/collectible, you'll have to pay for it.	1
	and more often that not, the down payment is not refundable.	1
	they may say it is, but read the fine-print carefully.	1
	it's worded such that that custom option installed makes the down payment non-refundable.	1
	so, if you find issues with the car (or your preference changes, i.e.	1
	it's not what you thought it would be), you're stuck with it.	1
	good luck!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2095#msg2095re: couple of questions: [blackadder5639]        well, the genesis will not be available with a manual transmission, unless you are thinking of the coupe that will be out next year.	1
	however, to answer (from one viewpoint anyway) the question about ordering a special car and pricing, i would like to take a stab.	1
	most of the time the reason for discounting a car (or any other type of inventory) is to stimulate sales or to reduce inventory.	1
	if a dealer is having to order a car just for you and especially if it is not a mass market package as you have mentioned here, then there is no incentive to offer a discount.	1
	most likely no other dealer is going to have an 'oddball' package that they are trying to desperately give away unless they ordered it by mistake.	1
	anyway, just thought i would offer one point of view.	1
	i still don't have my first genesis!!!!	1

	easy.	1
	if that something costs $40,000+, then i would really need to feel the love.	1

	i was completely impressed seriously.	1
	the car has really nice quality leather interior smelled like bmw leather to me.	1
	the leather dash was really cool also hopefully it wears well.	1
	the v6 had plenty of power especially for the weight of the car, the transmission was awesome which helps the v6 i think some.	1
	tons of interior room and very upscale looking both inside and out.	1
	the car just felt extremely solid and the suspension was very very smooth and not floating at all i felt.	1
	i hear the v8 model will be stiffer but this one wasn't soft either.	1
	not bmw firm more like a lexus ride i would say.	1
	i would put this car as a cross between my 2003 infiniti q45 the interiors look a lot alike, and the exterior of a 5 series bmw with an overall lexus driving feel.	1
	i think they did a super job on this car!!!	1
	my current lease is up in 6 months so it will definitely be a possibility when the time comes!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2102#msg2102re: couple of questions: [dueho]        you're right on most points, except the factory order.	1
	you can always back away from an order and i have never had, nor heard of anyone that, did not get their deposit back.	1
	also, you can get just as good, or better price on an ordered car.	1
	there are several reasons for this: one, the dealer knows that the car won't be sitting on the lot while they are paying interest on it.	1
	two, they increase their allocation of cars by ordering, usually for every car they custom order they get an equivalent increase in their allocation.	1
	three, unless you order the most ugly (neon yellow) color, they will most likely be able to sell it.	1
	most of the time people custom order because the dealer doesn't have the color they want or doesn't have a particular option or package on the lot.	1
	it is rare that someone will order a car with a truly bizarre option set.	1
	also, there are very few options that are offered that are so outrageous no one would want them, unless you're talking about bentley's and maserati's which can be customized up the wazoo, and then you're in a completely different ballgame anyway.	1
	when i was buying my most recent car, i ordered it from a dealer after the car i wanted was sold,  i got the same price i negotiated for the car that was on the lot before someone else bought it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2103#msg2103re: couple of questions: [docrw]        only problem is you're going to have to wait for it to be shipped from korea.	1
	anyone know how long a special-order genesis might take to receive?	1
	another option is a dealer swap.	1
	see if another dealership has the car you want and trade him for it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2104#msg2104re: couple of questions: [kenb757]        i discussed the swap option with a dealer when i bought my azera and he told me that they'd have to charge me about $500 more for the car.	1
	when i pressed him on why, he said that the 'hold-back' they receive is given to the dealer from which the car came.	1
	in other words -- they wouldn't get the hold-back on the car i buy.	1
	it would go to the dealer from which it came.	1
	but then i bought up the fact that they would send an azera to the other dealer to swap and that hold-back would go to them when sold.	1
	the dealer said that was true, but there was no guarantee that it would sell and so they have to prepare for the worst by charging me $500 extra to do a swap.	1
	needless to say, i didn't do the swap.	1
	but that was only one of 1,322 problems i had with the four hyundai dealerships i dealt with and some of the other problems were far far worse.       	1

	no problem.	1
	your story is one reason why the genesis program may just be shot down before it gets going.	1

	figure out what the real price is, then make a fair deal based on how many there are on lots and what others pay.	1

	but that's not the customization we're talking about.	1
	let's say you want a beige or brown interior with that silver exterior.	1
	that's where you need to read the fine-print regarding custom configuration.	1
	chances are that the refund doesn't cover non-standard configuration.	1
	i'd be very surprise if it does.	1
	in the example above, if things don't turn out the way you expect, then the dealer is stuck trying to sell a silver car with a brown interior.	1
	imagine the discount he'll have to throw in to get anyone to buy it.	1
	i know about this because i recently look to do a factory order of a build enclave.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2111#msg2111re: couple of questions: [albook]        yeah, i've been using those advices for the past 10 years to buy 4 cars.	1
	i got three at or below invoice and one slightly above invoice.	1
	so, i'd say those work for me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2112#msg2112driving impressions!!!	1
	okay...i finally got to take a genesis for a test spin.	1
	i say that a bit tongue in cheek as it was a short ride and i didn't get to traverse any highways or city streets either.	1
	anyway...i tested a midnight blue 3.8 premium plus packaged genesis ($36k).	1
	the dealer also had an ice blue standard premium package ($35k) and a black base model ($33k).	1
	i took my time to sit in the car, to touch the surfaces and see how everything looked and felt.	1
	the front seat is easy chair comfortable, but you don't sink down into it, the leather has a thick, supple feel to it.	1
	all the controls are well laid out and well marked.	1
	it takes no time to understand what controls what and how to operate everything, even the sound system was intuitive.	1
	the dash has a very high quality feel to it.	1
	the surfaces that are not covered with the nice faux wood grain or leather have a very soft, supple feel to them.	1
	it has the same feeling as the top part of the dash in the azera.	1
	the arm rest on the center console is even covered with actual leather (unlike the terrible leathertte in the azera).	1
	okay, after sitting up front, i had to climb in back to see what the rear seat offered potential riders.	1
	i'm 6'2' and i weigh 215 lbs.	1
	with the driver's seat in the position i need it to be in to drive comfortably, i am able to climb in the back seat (behind the driver's seat) and sit with my knees together (in my azera, i can sit behind the driver's seat, but my legs are open so that my knees are on either side of the seat back).	1
	anyway, the reat seats offer a very comfortable seating position.	1
	not quite as easy chair comfortable as the front seats, but not far off.	1
	one feature i like is that the climate control for the rear riders isn't completely controlled by the front.	1
	on the back of the center console, you have two vents as well as a dial to either raise or lower the temp of the air and another to cut the air flow off.	1
	also, on the b-pillar, there is another vent for the rear seat riders as well.	1
	another thing i liked is that they used brighter led lights for the overhead lights.	1
	okay...on to the drive.	1
	with the key sitting in the cup holder of the center console, i pushed the brake down and pushed the start button.	1
	there's a slight pause (and you hear a couple things happening), then the car comes to life.	1
	the one i tested had the steering column set for easy out, so it lowered into place for me and afterwards, i adjusted (power adjust) it with the switch on the side of the column, set the seat the way i needed it and adjusted the mirrors.	1
	i opened the sunroof and all the windows so i could listen to the car for a little while.	1
	then...i eased on the gas to pull out of the lot.	1
	the car responds nicely to light touches on the gas pedal, it eased out onto the street and i straightened out and went on my way.	1
	driving down the street, heads turned left and right as i cruised through the little town (doing no more than about 35 mph at this point).	1
	the car had a very, very solid feel.	1
	i purposely rode over any potholes or uneven spots of pavement to see how it handled them...nothing but poise.	1
	i was able to work my way over to a road that allowed for some higher speed cruising, but there were a lot of lights so the drive was interrupted every so often.	1
	however, i was able to stomp on the gas pedal to get a feel for it's response.	1
	acceleration is smooth and strong.	1
	it does lack the lower end torque, so it doesn't snatch you back, but...you do know you're accelerating briskly.	1
	the exhaust is quiet and you really don't hear much of a growl unless you're really into the accelerator and catching the higher end of the tach.	1
	the brakes, very smooth, quiet and confident.	1
	i wasn't able to find any twists and turns to see how the body felt in transitions from a side to side type of action, but the feel i get when turning corners...i think it would handle those with a solid stability that you don't get in the azera.	1
	there is certainly no floaty feel at all when driving the genesis, you feel very connected to the road.	1
	okay...after all that, i had to have a little fun.	1
	on my way back to the dealership, i turned the esc off and at an intersection, i punched the gas pedal and forced the back wheels to break traction, hit the turn and brought it back under control without any fuss...the balance of the car is extremely nice.	1
	well, that pretty much sums up my ride for now.	1
	next time, i'm going to go back with the wife and we are going to take an extended cruise to really get a feel of how the genesis handles downtown dc streets, see how it is on the highway and find some fun roads to tackle.	1
	hopefully by then, they'll have the v-8 in stock and i can really have some fun.	1
	p.s.	1
	oh....as far as storage goes, i'm used to what my azera offers so i didn't find storage to be a problem in the genesis.	1
	one write up said that they would like to have seen more.	1
	honestly, it's really hard to find anything that's really wrong with the car except for omissions like power side view mirrors.	1
	power pedals really isn't needed considering the steering wheel telescopes, raises  lowers and the driver's seat adjusts plenty of ways to get you in the best position to drive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2113#msg2113genesis brochures are in        hey guys.	1
	i got my genesis brochures in today.	1
	i would assume that would mean that most all dealers should have them now or within a day or so.	1
	the v8 wheels are so sharp!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2114#msg2114re: take a look [ricwhite]        based on the tags and the quad tipped exhaust, i would say that's a korean spec genesis.	1
	i say that because there's pics of an azera done similarly.	1
	the wheels would more than likely be aftermarket for sure.	1
	there's a a couple of places that offer aftermarket stuff for hyundai's and i'm sure it won't be long before they have quite a few offerings to spruce up an already beautiful car (the genesis).	1
	in case you're interested, the two best sites i've found for hyundai aftermarket stuff:                                 korean auto imports                                 seoulful racing        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2115#msg2115re: genesis brochures are in [jeffreid]        jeffreid...are the wheels on the v-8 any different than the ones that come on the 3.8 w/premium plus package (18' wheels)???	1
	i was in a showroom today and even the 17' wheels that come standard on the genesis look good, they have a very bmw-ish look to them.	1
	i'd love to see them in chrome.	1
	by the way, your review was extremely on point on every aspect.	1
	i test drove one today (3.8 w/premium plus package).	1
	i'm waiting for the 4.6 model to come along so i can test that one too.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2116#msg2116re: driving impressions!!!	1
	[allmet33]        great review!!!	1
	seems like everyone's waiting for the v8, especially given the slight change in price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2117#msg2117re: genesis brochures are in [allmet33]        v8 gets it own wheels.	1
	there are two for the v6 trim lines.	1
	the base v6 and the one with premium packages.	1
	believe it or not, i actually prefer the base v6 wheels                wonder if i could do a v8 order with the v6 base wheels - maybe hyundai could give me a discount or something        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2118#msg2118genesis lease options        i drove the 3.8 with premium plus package yesterday.	1
	the ride was really comfortable even though i did not get much to drive (dealer said that if you are not looking at buying right away we don't want you to put too many miles on it!!).	1
	the car has a good balance, leather in 3.8 does have sporty feel, more on bmw side than on lexus.	1
	i guess the 4.6 will be slightly on the softer side.	1
	i drove about 12 miles on freeways, on city roads and took couple of sharp turns.	1
	i did not try playing with the manual transmission or putting the padel strong enough to get tyres screatching.	1
	but the car handled everything well.	1
	i could not stop admiring how easy i was 30 to 80 while entering freeway ramp without even feeling that i was already at 80 in less than 4 seconds.	1
	the car has ample space, 18' wheels are really nice and has bmw feel to it.	1
	the storage space is plenty.	1
	the best part was the roomy rear seats and the adjustable head rests.	1
	i think this car has the best rear seats amongst its so called competitors.	1
	now, to the best part of my experience.	1
	i spoke to 3 different salesman yesterday about the car and all 3 of them had very little info on the car.	1
	none of them have been to the training class for genesis (i stay in detroit so i can understand dealers want to save some money) but i failed to understand why?	1
	finally, one guy showed me the lease promo that hyundai is offering on the vehicle.	1
	the only advertised promo is $399/mo with 1800 down.	1
	so the total down is $2199 - no security deposit.	1
	you will pay sales tax, acquisition fees ($500) plus title and registration in addition to the lease amount.	1
	but the hyundai lease option page had more info on other trims as follows (keeping the initial down payment same):                                3.8l base model - msrp-$33,000 - $399/mo                3.8l premium package - msrp - $35,000 - $419/mo                3.8l premium plus package - msrp - $36,000 - $$439/mo                3.8l tech package - msrp - $40,000 - $499/mo                4.6l base - msrp - $38,000 - $489/mo                4.6l tech package - msrp - $42,000 - $559/mo                                the money factor is 0.00080 ~ 1.92% apy (which is really good)                lease term: 24 months                residual value - 66% for all trims                                i was really confused with the options, since if you look at the difference in msrp and compare it with lease charges per month.	1
	for 3.8l premium (+2k diff.)	1
	the lease charges are additional $20/mo.	1
	but for 3.8l premium plus (+3k diff).	1
	the lease charges are additional $40/mo.	1
	so for the next $1k the lease goes up by $20/mo whereas for the first $2k it is same $20.	1
	so for 7k difference in 3.8l tech - it should be only $469/mo but it is $499/mo???	1
	and for the 4.6l it is unbelievable $489/mo so you pay only $10/mo for a $40k loaded 3.8l compared to $38k 4.6l base model.	1
	the pricing on loaded 4.6l should be around $499/mo considering the base price of $399/mo for 33k base model whereas the official price is $559/mo.	1
	i think hyundai has messed up the lease pricing big time, because if you do the math correctly, it is easy to figure out that you would be better of buying the 3.8l tech and 4.6l / 4.6l tech compared to leasing it.	1
	the best lease value package is 3.8l premium plus but it should have been max $429 and not $439/mo.	1
	if someone can negotiate more on the msrp, i am sure the down payment can also come down from ridiculous $1800.	1
	jeffreid, have you noticed these anamolies in leasing options?	1
	your views will help.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2119#msg2119re: genesis brochures are in [joe97]        i was afraid of saying the same thing thinking y'all might think i'm crazy.	1
	i was seriously admiring the wheels on the base model.	1
	i'm sure if you wanted those, it wouldn't be hard to find someone with the 17' wheels to trade you for the ones on the v-8!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2120#msg2120re: genesis lease options [milan13]        the differences in the leases are most likely due to changes in the residuals.	1
	i would assume that the %'s are slightly different by trim level.	1
	for example a base v8 may have a higher residual % than say a fully loaded tech package v6.	1
	that is why the math isn't working out quite the way you think it should.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2121#msg2121re: driving impressions!!!	1
	[joe97]        well...to be honest, it makes total sense.	1
	if you're looking at getting a fully loaded 3.8 w/tech package ($40k), you may as well pony up the extra $2k and get a fully loaded 4.6 w/tech package.	1
	you get 80 more hp, better leather, better tranny and better brakes.	1
	to put it in perspective, the difference between the 3.8 premium and the 3.8 premium plus is $1k and the only difference is the wheels (17' to 18').	1
	so, look at what you get for $2k going from a fully loaded 3.8 to a fully loaded 4.6, and...the fuel economy is pretty close to being the same 18/27 for the 3.8 and 17/25 for the 4.6.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2122#msg2122re: genesis lease options [tjc78]        the residual % is 66% for all trims and all options.	1
	so i do not see any reason why the lease numbers should vary significantly.	1
	again, the math is math.	1
	with same money factor, same lease term and same residual %, you can't pay $30 more for 1k difference at one trim level and $10 more for the same difference at another trim level.	1
	just does not make sense.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2123#msg2123re: genesis lease options [milan13]        if the residual % is the same you are most definately right.... doesn't make sense.	1
	i missed that piece of info in your original post.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2124#msg2124re: genesis lease options [milan13]        from a business perspective, maybe it's not messed up pricing but rather strategic planning/positioning.	1
	if you push folks to lease the fully loaded models, then you stand to be able to make more money selling them at the end of the lease as opposed to a base model.	1
	thus, a fully loaded 3.8 being $499/mo vs. a base model 4.6                $489/mo.	1
	everyone knows that options are what sell used/previously leased vehicles.	1
	the only folks that can sell base models are rental companies and usually at a steep discount since they have such high mileage coupled with the fact that everyone knows it's lived a dogged life.	1
	at least...that's my opinion on it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2125#msg2125re: genesis lease options [milan13]        something is not right on the lease options.	1
	still, fantastic lease rates regardless - residual value 66% after two years (i have heard 50% and 49% after 3 years, v6 and v8 respectively).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2126#msg2126re: genesis brochures are in [allmet33]        the v8 wheels are different from the v6 wheels.	1
	either one of them.	1
	if you have seen pics of the premium v6 wheels, then imagine them with spaces between the spokes.	1
	they are really sharp.	1
	i have a v8 with tech coming in obsidian black and i think it is going to be super sharp.	1
	there is a pic of that car in the brochure, and honestly, i really want to try to talk my wife into that instead of the e or c-class that she wants.	1
	it is just so sharp.	1
	really.	1
	this is the first time that i have ever been personally excited about one of our products.	1
	not to say that the rest aren't good products.	1
	we own a 2007 sf limited.	1
	this is just the only one that has made me say, dang, i like that!!	1
	anyway, again, i do not know anything about the lease promos.	1
	i'm sorry.	1
	these aren't offered in my area, and as such, i am clueless.	1
	glad to hear you guys liked my review.	1
	i tried to be as unbiased as possible.	1
	also, to play devil's advoctae (please save the obvious car dealer jokes                ) , i can see the idea behinid wanting to limit some of the test drives.	1
	i have had to think about this as well.	1
	there will be a certain number of people who simply aren't in the market for a car when this unit comes to a showroom, and you want to keep your top of the line car in pristine retail condition, especially if you expect to get top money for it.	1
	just throwing that against the wall.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2127#msg2127dealer antics        starting a three-day test drive of a lincoln mks tomorrow and i won't be ready to turn my dts in until early next year when the lease is up.	1
	also considering a mb e350 lease for $569/mo.	1
	i think i'll have to consider the genesis long and hard before i give up the sales and service experience a high-end dealership provides, especially considering the miniscule difference in lease rates between the top of the line genesis and a $55k msrp mb.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2128#msg2128re: dealer antics [kenb757]        the lease deals you can get out there right now on premium sedans are amazing.	1
	an infiniti m35 awd with technology package, an acura rl loaded up, both in the mid 500's.	1
	if you compare the lease rates to the msrp, those cars might be a better deal than the genesis.	1
	that's why i'm having a hard time making the decision!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2129#msg2129re: genesis lease options [milan13]         you will pay sales tax, acquisition fees ($500) plus title and registration in addition to the lease amount.	1
	a couple of lease questions (never leased a car before).	1
	one has to pay the full sales tax up front when you lease?	1
	on a $40k car where i am (6%) that is an extra $2400 (basically $100 per month).	1
	i thought since one is basically renting the car they did not have to pay the whole sales tax.	1
	when you buy a car and trade them in every few years, the value of the trade in reduces the tax one pays.	1
	if you lease it you walk away from the car at the end and have no trade in.	1
	$100 per month just for the tax on a rented car sounds outrageous.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2130#msg2130re: dealer antics [kenb757]        they are letting you take a mks for 3 days when you aren't in the market for 6 months?	1
	i guess lincoln is desperate.	1
	i cannot even take a car out by myself where i am (53 years old - not a kid).	1
	if i give the car 1/2 throttle the salesman always starts mouthing off about taking it easy.	1
	it is really hard where i am (fl) to get a complete idea of what the car is like.	1
	the local lexus dealer goes so far as to tell you the route to take!!!	1
	i am still waiting for my local hyundai dealer to get their first genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2131#msg2131re: genesis lease options [tom17]        there are some states that charge sales tax on the full price of the car whereas in some states you pay tax only on the monthly lease amount.	1
	pl.	1
	check with you dealer on what is applicable in your state.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2132#msg2132re: genesis lease options [allmet33]        the lease numbers you have posted make perfect sense since the fully loaded v6 has a msrp of $40,000.00 and the base v8 has a msrp of $38,000.00.	1
	also the money factors are different for all of the trim levels.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2133#msg2133re: dealer antics [kenb757]        the mb e350 requires $4214.00 plus your first and fees not to mention the tax difference not added to the monthly payment.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2139#msg2139re: dealer antics [jrvpm]        the $4214 is higher than the genesis' initial required payment but it includes the first month's payment.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2143#msg2143another v8 add-on        i was reading the genesis brochure last night while my wife went to the grocery store (there was nothing worth watching last night, ended up putting in the last samurai on hddvd ) and i noticed something else that the v8 brings that is different than the v6 model.	1
	you get a thicker rear stabilizer bar with the v8.	1
	i would think that maybe this would make the v8 handle a little better.	1
	does this make sense?	1
	i was just thinking that maybe it would keep the car even flatter in the corners.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2144#msg2144re: another v8 add-on [jeffreid]        jeffreid...it would make sense to have a thicker rear stabilizer as the v-8 model has a bit more heft to throw around.	1
	considering the added weight of the v-8 and beefier zf tranny, not to mention the beefier rotors at each corner along with the 4 piston calipers to boot.	1
	i was reading a review that mentioned testers that drove both v-6  v-8 models preferred the balance of the v-6 moreso than that of the v-8, however...the trade off is the power and braking that the beefier components give you with the v-8.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2145#msg2145re: another v8 add-on [allmet33]        that all makes sense.	1
	you know, i have been thinking to myslef that it seems a little suspicious that any of these reviewers can really tell the difference in a 52/48 weight split and a 54/46 split.	1
	i just wonder if a person gets into a car knowing that the weight bias is different and then 'knows' that the other car was better.	1
	i am curious as to what the result would have been if that piece of info had been withheld.	1
	that's like the 2 hp advantage that the accord 4cyl holds over the sonata 4cyl.	1
	is there any noticeable difference in the real world, or is it 'gutsier' because it has 2 extra horses?	1
	just thinking out loud.	1
	also thinking out loud, if the genesis really does 0-60 in 5.6 secs, then why is that 'impressive' when i read reviews of 'premium' cars doing it in 5.5 secs and being referred to as 'ripping' or 'burning' fast?	1
	does that 0.1 sec make your hair catch fire or something?        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2147#msg2147re: another v8 add-on [jeffreid]        well... you know jeff... alot of it has to do with the infamous butt dyno people have.	1
	yes, they connect usb port cables up the wazu to provide vital information about the differences in vehicles.	1
	and of course, if it has a 'prestige' name brand on it, then it demands profound expressive words to capture the audience.	1
	otoh, i test drove a base v6 today and left very impressed.	1
	even the base model shows some good 'luxury' quality and handled very well.	1
	if i compare it to the infiniti m35 (this should rattle some feathers here), i would say it was just shy of the same level of handling suspension.	1
	the gas pedal is throttle happy.... just touching it, sends the car thrusting forward.	1
	the only thing i didn't like, was in shift mode, the computer changes gear once it reaches about 5500 rpm's.	1
	but in at mode, when you floor it, it hits redline before it changes gears.	1
	- i'm thinking a good tuning can fix this little problem - at least giving you the ability to hold it alittle more in shift mode.	1
	i personally would've preferred to let me shift instead of the computer.	1
	but maybe hyundai played it safe with their new engine.	1
	i'm looking forward to the v8.. i think i've found my next car.	1
	very impressed with it        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2148#msg2148drove a v8 navi genesis this afternoon        i have to say-i love the genesis v6 with premium package but the v8 drives and handles much different.	1
	not impressed with the v8.	1
	the ride is definitely stiffer and the 18 inch low profile tires add to the stiffness i think.	1
	the car is powerful and really cranks when you get it up on the highway.	1
	one of the reviews that were posted early on in this forum stated that the v6 is very polished, powerful and quiet-and the reviewer didn't see a reason to fork over 5k more for the v8.	1
	i didn't understand what he meant but i do now.	1
	i drove the v8 for about an hour on surface streets and two highways-i got a good feel.	1
	the v6 premium package is what i bought-i'm comfortable with my choice.	1
	by the way-i am in phoenix, az area and all the dealers in this area except mine are marking the genesis up $2000.00-$5000.00.	1
	my dealer is fantastic-msrp all the way baby.	1
	invoice would be better-but at least it isn't market adjustment.	1
	hope this is helpful to some of you guys.	1
	if you have any questions i could probably answer them-i've researched this car to death and have now driven the v6 and v8 versions.	1
	i also now understand the comments from other posters on the wheels-in my opinion-the v6 premium plus wheels are hands down better looking than the v8 wheels-take a look when the genesis is available in your areas and see if you agree.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2149#msg2149re: drove a v8 navi genesis this afternoon [deeezldoc]        congrats!!!	1
	thanks for the report.	1
	i'll have to keep those in mind when i get my test drive opportunities.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2152#msg2152re: dealer antics [coug3]         the lease deals you can get out there right now on premium sedans are amazing.	1
	an infiniti m35 awd with technology package, an acura rl loaded up, both in the mid 500's.	1
	if you compare the lease rates to the msrp, those cars might be a better deal than the genesis.	1
	that's why i'm having a hard time making the decision!	1
	exactly.	1
	i have only begun to get 'back in the game' in looking and trying to decide upon which car to get, because work has kept me so busy lately, and lo and behold - i'm seeing 45k to 55k cars being leased for anywhere from $379 to $530 per month, with very little down required.	1
	normally, i'd be aversed to leasing a car, but when i can lease a loaded bmw 5 series, mercedes e350, infiniti m35/m45 for less or just a few bucks more than a genesis 3.8, i mean, c'mon...it's a no brainer.	1
	this is what i felt all along.	1
	hyundai lacks the upper crust dealer service, prestige and product to charge about the same amount of money on a lease as any of the aforementioned cars, given that the economy is in the doldrums, and automakers and dealers are slashing prices and incentivizing deals to make up on volume what they can't on margin.	1
	would anyone really not think a bmw 5 series isn't a better deal on a monthly lease for $100 more a month than the genesis 3.8 liter?	1
	you can get an infiniti m35 or a cadillac cts for less!!!	1
	i have test driven the v6 and cannot wait to drive the v8, not anymore (: i was hoping that the 18 wheels would give it a better ride, i wonder if higher profile tires would solve the stiffness issue?	1
	thanks for the insight.... did you have a chance to toy around with the navigation?	1
	real curious on how user-friendly it is and anything else you might be able to share....thanks.	1
	this will be a major downfall of the genesis if the ride is overly stiff.	1
	i've been starting to hear this a lot.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2153#msg2153re: dealer antics [rotary]        i'd be disappointed if the v8 is stiffer than the v6.	1
	to me, the v6 strikes a fine balance between performance and comfort.	1
	it just needs a little more 'kick' in the rear.	1
	it seems like hyundai is catering to the driving enthusiasts with the v8.	1
	are they serious that the enthusiasts, at least for the time being, would pick the genesis over the well-established bmw5 or infinity m?	1
	maybe they're trying to do too many things at once here?	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2154#msg2154re: drove a v8 navi genesis this afternoon [deeezldoc]        does your local dealer have the v8 in stock already?	1
	i thought it was going to be august before they showed up.	1
	i am still waiting for any genesis to show up at my local dealer (florida).	1
	they have them in orlando (about an hour away).	1
	i cannot get the color i want yet anyway (pearl white), so i guess it is nbd.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2155#msg2155re: wheels [mnjasper]        i should be able to go over to my local dealer this weekend and take a couple of quick pictures of the wheels on the v6 and v8's.	1
	i'll post them when i get them.	1
	to answer the other poster's question-the nav system seems very user friendly and easy to use.	1
	my uncle has a 2007 avalon limited and the nav system on his car is definitely less user friendly than the one that i played with yesterday in the v8 genesis.	1
	my dealer has the v8 genesis that belongs to hyundai corporate-they will be rotating the v8 amongst the dealers here in arizona to allow them to test drive for customers until the v8's are available to the public in late august.	1
	the v6's are starting to rain down on the dealers around here-there are 24 of them headed to the dealer that i've been working with because they bought up all the genesis' that were available that were turned down by the other 8 hyundai dealers in this area-as i posted before-they are the only ones that i have found that are selling at msrp and not marking these vehicles up.	1
	the official release date for the genesis is 07/15-that's why the info has been sketchy-the info situation is getting better i think.	1
	by the way-i should have mentioned earlier that my dealer is power hyundai in scottsdale, az.	1
	the general manager, mike davis, is outstanding and is really pissed at the other dealers who are 'price gouging' by marking these cars up $5000.00 over msrp-he is a genuine 'car nut' who is excited about getting these cars out there and taking care of the customer in the process-what a concept                .	1
	although jeffreid (posted several times here) seems very decent, and my dealer is great, i honestly have no time or patience for the nonsense that most dealers try to pull on the public-at least the ones that i have run into related to my genesis quest.	1
	if you really want a genesis and don't want to get gouged-you might want to consider visiting beautiful arizona and driving it home depending on where you live.	1
	i work for a caterpillar dealer and have no connection with my car dealer, but thought this might help avoid some of the frustration with the markups and shenanigans that i'm reading in the posts.	1
	i've seen and verified the prices that my dealer is selling for, and i've seen how many cars that they ordered and when they are coming in-so i know my info is solid.	1
	apologize for being long winded-thought this might help some of you guys who are seriously looking for a great ride.	1
	premium plus package is awesome-ask yourself if you really want to part with 4k for tech pkg/nav system-it will definitely help resale but other than that ..............    remember-those of us who have been involved in this forum for several months know much more about these cars than the majority of the hyundai salesmen and dealerships out there-hopefully that is improving as more of them get into showrooms.	1
	jeffreid-you are the exception sir...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2156#msg2156re: wheels [deeezldoc]        since i am not very close to arizona, this is a shot in the dark, but do you think that the markups in that area are an indication of the other dealers trying to hold onto their genesis' until supply ramps up?	1
	it may not make much sense if the dealers are grouped closely together and one of them is staying at msrp, but it was just a thought.	1
	the genesis will be one of a very few hyundai (some azera and some veracruz models) products with $2k+ invoice to msrp markup, so i would think that most salespeople/salesmanagers would be pretty happy with msrp anyway.	1
	i just don't see that the extra headache of explaining the 'market adjustment' being worth it.	1
	i still don't have any cars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
	i think mine must have been abducted by aliens.	1
	by the way, i did play with the nav system and it took 2-3 minutes to get used to the directions that you have to turn the knob.	1
	once i did get used to it, it seemed very straightforward and easy to use.	1
	however, the voice command was horrible.	1
	i have not played with a voice system before and have been told that most all of them stink, but this thing would not do anything.	1
	except repeat back the wrong command.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2157#msg2157re: genesis lease options [milan13]        sales tax is the one thing i can think of where south carolina has it all over everyone else: you never pay more than tax on $5000 value regardless of the cost of the car (tax here is 6%, so that would be $300, thank you).	1
	it doesn't matter if you buy a $12,000 minimal 'high mileage special' or a top-of-the-line bentley: it's still $300.	1

	...was also told that there has been a 'port hold' on the genesis which means they fill up all the docks around the country and won't allow any to be shipped to dealers until literally the docks are full....then they ship one to each dealer to make sure no individual dealer has an advantage...ok, so i learn something new every day....                                my 06 azera limited has in many ways been the best car i have ever owned...now over 38,000 miles ...only a couple of problems...lost the first set of tires (michelin) at 22,000 miles because alignment was out and (stupid me), i thought the 5 yr 60,000 mile bumper to bumper covered what it said....wrong !	1
	..after haggling with dealer, they did reallign the car, but could not do anything about the ruined tires (michelin would not stand behind them either..'it was an alignment problem, you know').....so, researched tires at tirerack.com and got the best, quietest tires i have ever owned....goodyear response edge touring....that was $600, but well worth it....on any hyundai, check the 12 month only warrenty for 'adjustments' and have it gone over with a fine tooth comb at 11 months...                                other problem was an in warrently switch went out on the passenger side seat tilt...it came forward all the way and my wife had to ride the remainder of our 2,000 mile trip in the back seat...took 2 trips to the dealer (diagnosis,first and order part), then return for installation)....good service, but still a pain in the neck...                                my normal driving (we live in the mountains) milage is around 21 mpg and do about 28.5 on the highway (air on all the time, do about 70-75 where allowed)                                now to the genesis.....it is slightly larger, and i mean slightly, driver's seat area feels like there is more room, especially feet area, with left knee still rubbing against door, but not right knee against console like it seems in the azera......trunk is quite a bit larger, but note, you can no longer lay the rear seat backs down,so with exception of a ski hole in the center arm rest, the trunk is all you got (at age 67, i don't need skis anyway)....actual room in the back seat seems a little smaller, but then the azera is very comfortable..                                seats are more fully padded than azera so car feels more like a luxury car....and it is noticibably quieter than the azera, rides over bumps much more smoothly and you hardly know the v6 is running, even when stomped on, and it is fast, but not any noticible difference with my azera....the sticker says 17  27 (who really knows) but it calculates annual fuel cost using $2.80 a gallon, was the sticker printed several years ago?.......very smooth 6 speed transmission, hardly notice shifting.....                                they have substantially improved the dash lighting...from one item to the other, they seem to use the same lighting color configuration (makes it much easier on the eyes than the azera)...fewer storage spaces in the front cabin, but the cup holders are better positioned so you aren't reaching backward to get your cup...many more controls are in the steering wheel....interesting, the brochure shows a wood grain, mostly leather wrapped steering wheel, but its all leather wrapped...                                one of my biggest complaints about the azera is i was told that the cd changer had ramdom play...can't say they lied, it does, but only within a disc, not between and among discs....that's about as useless as you know what.....so i had to have a jvc 12 disc changer installed in the trunk which has true random play throughout the entire collection....has the genesis corrected that problem?...no way, be sure to check it out if that is a concern to you.....it has xm radio (only 3 month trial for the service), blue tooth for your cell (you must have a blue tooth phone)...does not appear to have a backup camera or sensor....may have with the nav package (not on the one i tested or in the dealers information knowledge bin)...                                they have removed two items i found very helpful on the azera: (1) electric folding side mirrors) and; (2) adjustable pedals for the driver....                                i couldn't wait to see and drive the new genesis.......overall impression is that it is a good car, missing some things i find important to me and i was not awe struck enough to want to go out and pay almost $6,000 more (they will get sticker for awhile) than i could get the newest azera for with the addition of nav and built in xm radio......the styling is so similar to the azera that i think they missed a differentiation point here ...will be interested in others impressions as time goes along       	1

	i am a bit sceptical of this ad.	1
	it looks like a teaser that they are using to get you in the door with the 'well you don't qualify' speech at the end.	1
	oh, and on top of that, the financing that they are detailing here would not be available with these rebates either.	1
	the college grad program comes with a tier 2 rate from hmfc at a max of 60 months.	1
	you have to finance with hmfc to get the rebate.	1
	that sure isn't 5.90% and it isn't 96 months either.	1
	crazy.	1
	however, it does look like there is a $500 dealer discount in there.	1
	at least it's below msrp.       	1

	if there are dealer discounts that are being thrown in, then that would change the final price, but the msrp will be $40,000.	1
	the $37,000 figure is due to the same mistake that my regional folks were telling me.	1
	they were only adding the $4000 to the $33000.	1

	traffic being what it was, i was able to get close enough to verify that there were four genesis sedans on board.	1
	so i guess they're really arriving everywhere now--our local hyundai dealer isn't very large, and until recently they were still trying to move '07 sonatas (never mind the '08s and '09s), so i doubt they have any clout with the parent company.	1

	my friend's civic (2008) nav screen was pretty bad due to its low resolution.	1
	compared to that, genesis has higher resolution screen, which makes it look like google map in smaller version.	1
	(just my thought) so, its lines are much smoother and when roads are displayed diagonally on the screen, their thickness is consistent from one end to the other.	1
	once you drive it does not let you enter destination address.	1
	but you can scroll the map screen (just like google map) and choose your destination.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2188#msg2188re: another v8 add-on [jeffreid]        well...i don't know if it's being able to tell the difference between the weight ratio difference.	1
	if anything, it's more about the characteristics of handling that are changed when you go to a stiffer suspension, lower profile tires, beefier sway bars...especially when you put it together with more power and a little more weight.	1
	i think the extra stiffness changes the handling dynamics enough that you can tell the difference between the two.	1
	concerning the genesis doing 0-60 in 5.6 being impressive.	1
	the fact that hyundai has a car that does that is what makes it impressive.	1
	something like that from bmw, benz, porsche, infiniti or lexus is expected...don't you think?	1
	now...5.5 or 5.6 seconds in a car that weight 4000 lbs...i guess that would be considered as ripping.	1
	i mean, you have coupes out here that are designed for speed and run 0-6 a full second faster, but taking all into consideration...a large luxo sedan running a full second behind a race inspired coupe isn't bad at all.	1
	maybe your hair won't catch fire, but it sure will get the adrenaline pumping, don't ya think?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2189#msg2189re: dealer antics [rotary]        rotary...i haven't heard anyone say that the ride in v-8 is overly stiff, just stiffer than that in the v-6.	1
	the ride in the v-6 isn't stiff at all, it's very controlled and yet at the same time, compliant over uneven surfaces.	1
	it doesn't beat you up, but rather absorbs quite nicely.	1
	i have yet to test a 4.6 v-8, but the ride in the 3.8 v-6 was quite impressive.	1
	if one is looking for the softest ride possible from the genesis, then they would need to opt for the 17' wheels of the base model.	1
	i tested the 3.8 w/ premium plus which had the 18' wheels and like i said before...impressive (i say impressive because we are talking about a hyundai).	1
	now...if the 4.6 v-8 is getting 18 wheels as well, the tighter suspension would definitely give it a stiffer ride.	1
	i think the genesis could have benefitted from an adjustable suspension, you know...a sport mode and a cruise mode.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2190#msg2190re: dealer antics [rotary]        exactly.	1
	i have only begun to get 'back in the game' in looking and trying to decide upon which car to get, because work has kept me so busy lately, and lo and behold - i'm seeing 45k to 55k cars being leased for anywhere from $379 to $530 per month, with very little down required.	1
	.......i'd like to see any 50k bmw, mercedes, or m35 infiniti for no money down and 500/mo.	1
	my local infiniti has a 499/mo lease ad special on an m35, but there's a                 13%                cap cost reduction, plus 1st, security, tax, etc, etc.	1
	mercdes has their e 350 w/ a payment in the high 500's, but it's almost $5000 out of pocket.	1
	a 45k car with no money down                379 mo...??	1
	yeah, show me any ad from anywhere in the country with that.	1
	look at the the fine print and you'll see the 10-12% cap cost reductions to get payments that low.	1
	you might be about to get a nicely equipped 30k vw passat for 400/mo with no money down.       	1

	regardless, by the time you strip out all of the backend factory money (that they may or may not qualify for), the dealer lost somewhere between $866-$1716, real, bottom line money.	1

	and the fee to ebay.	1
	this is getting worse and worse.	1

	curious as to what a 'deal' is when everything is in black and white.........       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2206#msg2206hyundai expects 80% take rate on the v6 trim lines         http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20080713/free/757454434/1065                                highlights:                                 buyers can lease the v-6 model, which went on sale in june, for $399 per month for 24 months with $2,199 due at lease signing.	1
	hyundai expects the v-6 to account for about 80 percent of the sales for the new luxury car.	1
	a strong residual value from automotive lease guide helped cut the cost of leasing.	1
	the santa barbara, calif., company, which sets residual standards for the industry, estimates that a 2009 genesis will be worth 50 percent of its original sticker price after 36 months.	1
	wallace, who also sells cadillacs and lincolns, says the genesis lease deal is $100 to $150 less per month than cadillac now offers on the cts, which hyundai says is a prime competitor.	1
	so where is that $379/month lease deal rotary talked about?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2207#msg2207re: test drive [jeffreid]        a 'deal' would be something below list price.	1
	the more the better.	1
	i know the dealer has to make a living but i believe there is room to haggle.	1
	with the way the economy is getting worse by the minute, no one is buying cars and the dealers will have to eat them.	1
	when i bought my last car a little over three years ago i called my insurance company (usaa) to tell them to add the new car and drop the old one, the woman said, 'you know we would have done your bargaining for you.'	1
	two weeks ago i went through my insurance company's web site and clicked on hyundai filled out a form and shortly there after someone called.	1
	when i told him i was interested in the genesis he of course said they didn't have any yet but expected them in soon.	1
	he said that i would get a good deal since i was with usaa.	1
	a few days later he called to tell me they had two but did not have one with the tech package.	1
	he said he would call when he gets one with a tech package.	1
	this is a different dealer from the one where i drove the car today.	1
	i also looked at a cadillac cts today.	1
	they had more than i could count.	1
	no one is buying cars.	1
	we are headed for a severe recession.	1
	discounts are coming sooner rather than later.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2208#msg2208re: test drive [richard124]        yeah, i would just hang on a few months.	1
	those dealers charging $2000 above retail will soon be charging $2000 below retail.	1
	this is a very bad market for most large luxury cars.	1
	the only reason the genesis is selling above retail is because it's brand new with few trickling in at the moment and it's a novelty.	1
	that will end soon and when it does, genesis will be in the same boat as every other large luxury vehicle.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2209#msg22092009 genesis        well i have two quotes on the following:                                2009 v6 msrp $40,000.00                sales price $36,999.00 + ttl                                2009 v8 msrp $42,000.00                sales price $38,900.00 + ttl                                all cash                                los angeles area       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2210#msg2210re: 2009 genesis [kenbt]        i don't think all cash or not actually matters, the dealer would actually prefer you to finance.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2211#msg2211re: 2009 genesis [kenbt]        that sounds about right for this market.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2213#msg2213re: 2009 genesis [louiswei]        if those numbers are right, then it's right in line with what i said intially when we were speculating about the price.	1
	the azera was slated to be $30k when it first came out, they were selling for under $28k when it actually came down to it.	1
	sure, there were the first few that probably were sold for $30k, but that didn't last long at all.	1
	maybe, just maybe....hyundai started the price high knowing it would actually sell for $2-3k less than the reported price.	1
	at $38k, maybe that's what they were expecting to sell the fully loaded v-6 at.	1
	who knows.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2214#msg2214re: 2009 genesis [houdini1]        probably the v8... just hate to buy a car then say... for 2k more v8       	1

	dealers continue to say any day now, but they've been saying that for the last few weeks.	1
	does anyone know what the deal is?	1
	as an acura rl owner, it's interesting hearing the customer service or lack thereof at certain dealerships when you call.	1
	there is one dealership that i would ultimately travel slightly further too because you can tell they are engaged in the sales process.	1
	a few others, although closer, remind me of a post i saw a few weeks ago when one of the forum members walked in and had to knock on the sales manager's door to get someone to help and once someone attempted to help him, it spoke volumes about the lack of service he would expect if he dealt with this crew.	1
	i don't believe anyone should be treated poorly when they walk into any dealership.	1
	and what car you're buying shouldn't make the difference either.	1
	but, you'd believe with the genesis premier, all dealers would 'up their game' and realize they have a chance to put hyundai in a better position by adding a new segment of potential buyers that may have never considered hyundai.	1
	because of the genesis i now intend to look at the veracruz and have become curious about other cars in their lineup.	1
	if hyundai doesn't get it together this may be a huge lesson in opportunity cost and not because my lease ends in 12 weeks, because they'll be many comers like me to follow......c'mon hyundai, get organized and get it together.       	1

	[kenb757]        i've been told the local hyundai dealer here is going to roll out the vip package for genesis owners.	1
	this hyundai dealer is very good imo - it provides free wash when a vehicle is brought in, plus free oil change, at least my neighbor gets that (he has a sonata).	1
	in terms of loaners, they'd always try to get you the same model or something similar.	1
	based on the record of the sonata i've seen first-hand, and heard, however, i feel pretty good about the genesis.	1
	the sonata has not been to the shop once, other than regular interval service items.	1
	glad to hear that trend has continued with a number of current hyundai vehicles, and i have no doubt it would continue to flourish on the genesis and other forthcoming products.       	1

	i have driven a stunning black with brown interior (cashmere) genesis with the premium plus package and i must say it exceeded my expectation with one minor annoyance to see that the subwoofer rear speaker did not have the cover lining in the trunk                .	1
	i also sat in a silver one with a black interior and that did not look half bad either.	1
	personally i think it has been worth the wait even though i have considered the usual suspects (m35, is350, c/basic e class etc) in last year or so                                the v6 although peppy, quite  and well behaved for me it looks like i am going to go for the v8 , otherwise i felt i would miss my 2000 trasam (with only 26k miles on it                ) far too much.	1
	my only other issue is lease vs. buy, since hyundai offering the lease deal where i live (atlanta, ga), i have never leased before but looking at the numbers it appears to be good option as i only have 20 miles round trip daily commute.	1
	given the current climate would it better to trade in my 2005 suv and the trasam to lease the genesis (do i save on the car tax?)	1
	or am i better off selling both vehicles elsewhere and banking the money?	1

	it's his oppinion and there's nothing wrong with that.	1
	i won't say the genesis doesn't look like a luxury car, but i agree that the cts looks better.	1
	if i was between the genesis v-6 and the cts, i'd go for the cts, prettty much because i think it looks better (and after driving it and what i've heard on the genesis, it drives sportier too).	1
	that might sound like an unrational decision, but i might not be the most rational person.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2245#msg2245genesis - asking $4k market adjustment        just decided to take a look at the new genesis.	1
	here in raleigh, one of the local dealers is charging a $4k premium over sticker for the one genesis they have in the show room.	1
	with that kind of markup over msrp, the 'great deal' of the genesis has disappeared - imho.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2246#msg2246re: buy vs. lease?	1
	[joe97]        everyone i know who leases writes off the lease payments as a business expense.	1
	a purchased car can be used as a trade in or sold outright to reduce the cost of the next vehicle.	1
	the more often you trade cars the better leasing is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2247#msg2247re: genesis - asking $4k market adjustment [go_mdx1]        many dealers do that and then sell for msrp or less.	1
	on the 09 maxima forum, someone bought a maxima for $1200 under msrp even though the dealer had a $5000 additional dealer profit sticker on the car.	1
	go figure.....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2248#msg2248re: genesis - asking $4k market adjustment [go_mdx1]        since they only have one genesis right now, they are in no hurry to sell it.	1
	they don't mind having a car for people to come look at.	1
	but with the $4k markup, they are saying, 'we don't really                 want                to sell it right away, but if someone makes us an offer too good to refuse, well then...'.	1
	once the cars start arriving in volume, you won't see those $4k markups anymore.	1

	[daviderle]        is the lack of a subwoofer cover from the trunk side of things really a big issue???	1
	i mean...how often do you actually get low enough to look at it to be annoyed by it?	1
	please don't be offended, i'm just asking a real question.	1
	honestly, the azera does have the underside of the subwoofer covered and i think the bass response suffers from the cover as the sub being used is a free-air sub and really needs the trunk space to create the bass.	1
	by placing a cover in it's way...it effectively lessens the amount of open space the sub can utilize.	1
	the bass response is actually much better in the genesis than it is in the azera because of that fact.	1
	hyundai would have been better served had they created a sealed enclosure under the deck if they wanted to cover the sub...that would have made a world of difference.	1
	personally though, i truly don't think that an uncovered sub takes away from the car in any way.       	1

	[daviderle]        well, i don't drive the trucks, but next year is gibberish!!	1
	my v6's still aren't here, and are now 2 weeks late.	1
	however, i know that at least one of them is in the pipe and should be here anytime now.	1
	with that being said, the v8 models are slated to arrive in late august or september.	1
	from my experience with the first santa fe launch (and every other hyundai launch) there cars are going to be 4-6 weeks late almost every time.	1
	i think that is you are in no hurry and can wait until november maybe, you should be the proud new owner of a v8 genesis.	1
	i agree with you, the dealer wants to get the cars on the road to drive more business.	1
	this is especially true when they feel that the car will sell for a premium.	1
	if they can put you in a v6 now by telling you it will be next year for a v8, then they can be sure they get a sale versus hoping for one later.	1
	a bird in the hand you know.	1
	i know i would wait for the v8.	1
	for only $2k more, i know i would want the extra power and the upgraded leather, not to mention the few extra goodies.	1
	with the fuel mileage being so similar to the v6, i just can't see not getting the v8.	1
	i really think that one would get the $2k back on resale as well.	1
	maybe more.	1
	if you look at the azera, the difference between one with the ultimate package and one with the premium pkg on resale is greater than the upfront cost.	1
	it is just so much easier as a dealer to sell the loaded used car than have someone being ambivalent about a car that is missing features, thus commanding a premium at trade in time.       	1

	we would have gotten one, but the outlook won our vote since it had captain's chairs in the 2nd row and there was enough space behind the 3rd row seat for a full sized stroller for our baby.	1
	personally, i feel the veracruz had better handling and a smoother ride which says a lot since the outlook rides and handles quite well for a vehicle of it's size.	1

	the pic below is pretty indicitave of how most subs look from the back side.	1
	as you can see...a typical bag of groceries or a suitcase or something like that would not be able to puncture the subwoofer cone at all.	1
	like i said earlier, by not having anything blocking the path of the sub, it is actually able to perform better than if a cover was in place.	1
	i agree,  punctured sub would sound terrible and drive you nuts, but the chances of it happening are pretty slim.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2260#msg2260genesis strong lease a farce for now        there are two genesis package 4 cars in our city (louisville, ky) - i have been patiently waiting on this day for months.	1
	i took a test drive - was even better than the base model i test drove weeks ago.	1
	i asked about the $499 24 month lease with $2199 down.	1
	apparently that is $665 per month.	1
	i asked about the $399 per month lease on the base model that they had a flier on (also 24 months and $2199 down).	1
	asked how much that would run a month - was told just shy of $470 per month.	1
	so the $399 a month lease is almost $470 and the $499 is $665 a month before tax, is that correct - yes, that is correct.	1
	money factor is .0008 and residual of 66% on the v6 with nav.	1
	so if the residual is fixed and the money factor is fixed - the the only item that can move is the capitalized cost which surprisingly it didn't.	1
	how is this possible?	1
	hyundai's lease special is based on the dealership selling the car at invoice (invoice).	1
	anyone know a hyundai dealership selling v6 genesis with tech package at invoice?	1
	most don't have a genesis - let alone a tech package.	1
	happy to be proven wrong - maybe there are many dealers out there that would sell a new genesis v6 package 4 at invoice.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2266#msg2266about the lease game        when i leased my azera, i searched far and wide for the $299/mo.	1
	lease deal that was advertised at the time.	1
	one dealer had the deal for $380, the other two were hovering around $500.	1
	what hyundai did was reduce the cap cost via lease rebates to get to that figure.	1
	the money factor and residuals were set.	1
	according to one of the dealerships -- the problem is that the dealer has to 'eat' the advertised cap cost reductions.	1
	even if they eventually get them back from hyundai, they would make no money on the vehicle.	1
	in the short term, it would actually cost them money.	1
	in other words, the 'lease deal' was dependent upon the dealership willing to lose money or, at best, make no money.	1
	out of the four hyundai dealerships i visited, only one was willing to do the lease deal as advertised.	1
	i called hyundai about it and they told me that dealerships have the option whether or not to do lease deals as advertised.	1
	in other words, the advertised 'lease deals' are rock bottom deals that most dealerships won't be willing to do.	1
	it's sounds really good in the advertisement and it probably serves it's purpose to get you into the showrooms, but, in all practicality, they are probably mostly unrealistic for most dealerships.	1
	i wish you luck.	1
	i did find a dealership that would honor the deal on my azera, but it took weeks and i had to travel to a different city.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2270#msg2270genesis dealers        i am beginning to hate all hyundai dealers.	1
	yesterday i stopped by the dealer that had promised me a good deal over the phone because i am with usaa.	1
	he said that the good deal does not apply to genesis.	1
	he wants sticker price.	1
	this is three dealers that i have been to now.	1
	two want sticker price and one wants $1,550 over sticker.	1
	i have told them all to give me a call when they get one with a tech package and we'll talk.	1
	a fourth dealer contacted me through costco and said a third genesis had just arrived and he had to check if it had the tech package.	1
	said he would give me a call right back.	1
	i guess it did not have the tech package in three days he has not called back.	1
	it's no wonder car dealers have a bad reputation.	1
	i have never felt good after buying a car.	1
	i have always felt like i was screwed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2271#msg2271re: genesis dealers [richard124]        i think it helps to keep in mind that sales is all about supply and demand, whether it's cars or homes or the iphone or whatever.	1
	we don't complain one bit when cars that are in good supply are priced way, way below msrp.	1
	but we think we are getting 'screwed' when a car that is a brand new model, eagerly anticipated by a segment of the buying public, and in extremely limited supply is priced at a little below msrp or at msrp or even above msrp.	1
	msrp is just that--manufacturer's                 suggested                retail price.	1
	actual prices are set by the dealers.	1
	on any car.	1
	it's not a matter of the dealers being rotten people (that may be true in some cases, but that's true in other walks of life also).	1
	they are in business to make money.	1
	if they have a product that more people want than are units available, they will set the price high.	1
	once supply increases relative to demand, the price will drop.	1
	if you don't like the idea of paying msrp or even above for a genesis, just wait a bit.	1
	prices will fall, ray, prices will most definitely fall (ala the movie you may or may not have seen,                 field of car dreams                ).        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2272#msg2272re: genesis dealers [richard124]        so what you are saying is that you hate a retailer (because that is what car dealerships are) for not having a limited production, entirely new, very competitively priced, and not yet fully rolled out product, on sale?	1
	it just seems so unfair to 'hate' a business that has a product that you like simply because they are asking for a  profit.	1
	a v6 tech pkg has an invoice amount of around $37363 and if they sell it for list, then they are looking at an over invoice profit of $2637.	1
	this represents at 7% profit.	1
	my question is this.	1
	how bad is costco sticking it to you when they are making 50%-200% on items that they are selling everyday?	1
	you are right about one thing though imo, the costco dealer should have called you back.	1
	that was pretty rude.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2274#msg2274re: genesis dealers [jeffreid]        i am mad because one dealer told me one thing over the phone (i would get a great deal) and another thing once i got there.	1
	if you don't think that is sleazy, then i don't know what is.	1
	i have looked at other cars also.	1
	it appears it is a common thing to put a second sticker in the window for phantom dealer add ons.	1
	i like the genesis and my lease is up on my present car in about six weeks.	1
	if they are not being discounted by then i will probably join the list of suckers.	1
	i wish i had a few more months to wait until the dealers were over loaded.	1
	at all of the dealers i have been to including dealers other than hyundai, i pointed out that they had no other customers.	1
	it was as if they recognized that they were selling very few cars so they had to raise the price so they could make more money                .	1

	actually the largest markup at coscto is 14%.	1
	they make most of their money on membership fees.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2283#msg2283re: genesis dealers [kenb757]         'it's called 'bait and switch' and it's illegal.'	1
	i don't know if it's illegal, but doesn't it seem strange that the national corporation openly advertises this deal, but it turns out to be unavailable to consumers because no dealers will honor it?	1
	there's something wrong with that picture.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2284#msg2284re: genesis dealers [backy]         if they have a product that more people want than are units available, they will set the price high.	1
	i agree with this.	1
	if we want to buy a new product that is in very short supply and that has lots of public enthusiasm, we should expect that the prices will be higher.	1
	the timing of this is unfortunate for me too, because i need to do my deal very soon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2285#msg2285re: genesis dealers [kenb757]        read the fine print on every lease ad from every company.	1
	they all say 'dealer contribution will affect final price'.	1
	this means that each independent dealer has the right to choose if they are interested in taking the discount that the mfr is suggesting.	1
	the mfr also suggests a price on the window of every car they build.	1
	each retailer is free to set their own pricing above or below that amount, as is most any other retailer of most any other type of product.	1
	also, as to the add-on stickers.	1
	now, i do not have them on more cars, but i do understand the thought behind them.	1
	the auto mfrs have done nothing but shrink the front end profits on cars for the last 20-30 years.	1
	this means more money in their pockets and less in the dealers and the sales people's.	1
	the add-ons are just an attempt to get some of that margin back.	1
	free market economy boys!!	1
	i would like to retract my costco comment.	1
	that was made with limited info.	1
	what i meant, and should have said, was a comment about elctronics and jewelry and furniture retailers in general.	1
	sorry.	1
	as to the 'they told me one thing on the phone and another in person' comment.	1
	there are two ways to look at this.	1
	one is the the obvious fact that the dealer has no shot to sell you if you never show up.	1
	telling you a set price or that there is no discount would prob keep you at home or on the phone shopping for price.	1
	the second way to look at it is the the genesis is still a lot of car, even at msrp, and that from that angle, they are giving you a 'good deal'.	1
	just some thoughts.	1
	i do not mean for any of these posts to try and change anyone's mind, i just think that having the point of view from the inside of the auto industry makes for good banter, and a more insightful conversation.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2286#msg2286discover genesis - bloomington        i did the discover genesis event in bloomington, mn today.	1
	based on the number of people lined up to drive the genesis, the event was a success.	1
	however, i think hyundai has something yet to learn about how to treat luxury-car buyers.	1
	i received an email invitation from hyundai and registered online for 11:00 today.	1
	i had the expectation that i would be able to drive the genesis somewhere close to 11:00, since the appointments were in 30-minute increments.	1
	when i arrived at the site, which is a parking lot next to the mall of america, there were about 50 people in line waiting to drive.	1
	i was told i had to sign a waiver and get in line.	1
	didn't matter if you had a reserved time or not--walk-ins and reservations all treated the same.	1
	this was a problem for me because i had limited time.	1
	but i waited in line, about 45 minutes, and finally got to drive.	1
	there were 5 genesii lined up to drive, a combination of loaded v6s and v8s.	1
	there was also an e550 and a cts for comparison drives.	1
	i chose a black v6--loaded, as i said.	1
	very very very nice inside.	1
	all appointments seemed of the highest quality, with brushed finishes on metal parts (except for chrome door pulls) and good-looking wood trim.	1
	the leather was soft and inviting.	1
	after a short discussion with the hyundai rep and adjusting the seat, wheel, and mirror, we took off.	1
	the short, compact course was laid out in a parking lot.	1
	first, there was a wet plastic tarp, to test the traction control.	1
	very important in places like mn.	1
	with just a bit of tail wag, the genesis took off.	1
	(i used more throttle than i normally would in such situations.)	1
	then there were a series of very tight turns, which the genesis negotiated at high speed with only a little tire noise and little body lean.	1
	then we stopped, and i floored the accelerator.	1
	there was engine noise, but muted.	1
	for comparison i took the cts (list about $48k) on the same course.	1
	the immediate impression upon climbing into the cts was that it was a huge notch below the genesis in luxury ambiance.	1
	it was like being in a 1970s buick--chrome everywhere.	1
	it also felt cramped compared to the genesis.	1
	(this was especially true in back--the genesis had cavernous rear leg room, while the cts was pretty close to the room of my elantra in back.)	1
	the cts also couldn't hold a candle dynamically to the genesis.	1
	the front suspension gave up on the first sharp turn.	1
	the engine growled loudly and coarsely when i floored it.	1
	it was clear why hyundai chose to have a cts there to compare with the genesis.	1
	it felt like the cts should be the car priced $10k less than the genesis, rather than the reverse.	1
	so i was very impressed with the genesis.	1
	but not how hyundai handled the event.	1
	if you will be attending this event, be prepared to wait in line awhile.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2287#msg2287re: genesis dealers [dborth]         it's no wonder car dealers have a bad reputation                                i think that this reputation goes beyond hyundai and other low-cost dealers.	1
	i have mb and lexus cars, yet i find their salesmen just as incompetent and lazy.	1
	last month i bought an is f ($61,000).	1
	the salesperson could not answer any questions.	1
	all he could say was small talk like how fast it felt and quiped about how i knew more about the car than he did.	1
	this week i bought a lx570 ($84,000) and another salesperson was only able to answer one softball question about safety.	1
	the only reason i asked him such an easy question was because he could not answer any question about the vehicle such as what the various buttons did or how to adjust the seating.	1
	i worked with 6 different salespeople in buying those two cars and not a single one of them knew anything about the cars they were trying to sell.	1
	i'm amazed that these guys could be stuck at the dealership all weeklong and not bother to learn anything about the cars they are selling.	1
	how incredibly lazy and incompetent do you have to be to not know anything about the expensive cars you are selling?	1
	seriously, i see them sitting on their butts all day waiting for customers to fall into their lap.	1
	i've found the salespeople at mb, infiniti, and audi to be no different in this regard.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2288#msg2288and that is just what i take away from the last        15 posts or so.	1
	msrp pricing is not evil, if you love the car, have to have it, and that car delivers what you want for that price.	1
	for instance, by the time mitsubishi came out with their 2008 lancer lineup, i was drooling all over my keyboard in anticipation of driving one and buying one.	1
	heck, when i got there to the dealership, the '08 lancer gts was there, in the showroom.	1
	rally red metallic paint job, with the rockford fosgate 650-watt stereo-subwoofer in the trunk, leather covered steering wheel, bluetooth capable, sunroof, foglights, etc.	1
	loaded, just not with a 5-speed manual tranny, instead, this one came with a cvt automatic with the magnesium 6 forward 'speeds' and 6 reverse 'speeds.'	1
	humm...what a dilemna.	1
	price was not gonna be a factor here, mode of propulsion became top story in the initial purchase process.	1
	after discussing it with my wife and test-driving the cvt, we went in to negotiations to buy that particular lancer.	1
	no need to discuss those numbers in this 2009 hyundai genesis automotive thread, but, my point is that my dealer supplied the car i wanted with everything i wanted and i was already in love with it's bodystyle big-time.	1
	after deciding that playing with the paddleshifters would be cool, or just having the option to put that pup in 'd' for 'drive,' would be acceptable, i looked at pricing negotiation time as just being a necessary evil.	1
	we prepaid on a maintenance coupon booklet(a good deal)and had rolled in to the loan for the anti-theft alarm to be activated, and also bought their 'auto butler' program.	1
	the auto butler program prepays in to the loan for them to put a protective coating on the paint every 6 months for 5 years.	1
	for the price paid it has turned out to be a good investment, as our lancer's rally red paint is holding up very well and shines wonderfully.	1
	my main point is that msrp was fine with me as i had bought the product i wanted, which, in person, actually exceeded my expectations.	1
	i was thrilled to pay msrp, and, lancer pricing, since it's a compact, is not sky-high to begin with.	1
	it is true that it may be more of an important factor when shopping for a larger car, the genesis, true.	1
	when i bought mitsubishi dealers were not budging much below msrp, but as the months rolled by they did budge.	1
	just a few thoughts to consider, pricing at msrp was more than just ok with this padre.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2289#msg2289re: and that is just what i take away from the last [iluvmysephia1]        i looked at a genesis this past week.	1
	while a great looking car, imho the world is not ready for a $38,000.00  hyundai.	1
	what we are dealing with is the egos of both the hyundai and kia motor companys ceos.	1
	i read a business article about how the chairman of kia wanted to compete in the 'near luxury ' market.	1
	all the americans managers told him that the price point was just too high for kia.	1
	consequently, kia sold 5,000 amantis last year.	1
	hardly a blip on the car buying public radar screens.	1
	unless they slap a $10,000.00 rebate on the genesis the results will be the same.	1
	low cost leases are one thing - somebody plucking down $35,000.00 to $38,000.00 for these things is something else!	1
	look at the rebates they have to slap on the sonatas and azeras to move those models.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2290#msg2290genesis dealers        wow, what a spirited reply to yesterday's posting about my $665 montly lease payment quote on the advertised $499 montly program.	1
	well, i just spent the last hour calling dealers that i know have the nav 4 car (easy to find as they have them listed on ebay).	1
	i found one dealer who was terrific.	1
	he outlined the $499 lease program on the nav 4 car.	1
	it is as follows:                                $2179 due at signing.	1
	includes first month and down payment.	1
	does not include tax, tag, etc.	1
	there is a $500 hmfc program that helps reduce the cap cost down to $37,155.73.	1
	so the dealer is selling for $37,655.73.	1
	mf = .0008 for tier 1.                                he was very familiar with the program and while he said dealers do not have to follow the programs - they do because it makes for happy customers and or course - repeat customers.	1
	their guideline was that if the program is national by hyundai - then they follow it.	1
	he would sell me the car today at those quoted prices.	1
	so, i cannot guarantee the accuracy of the numbers but have not reason to disagree with them either.	1
	this was from the finance manager of the dealership.	1
	so while i am unable to blame a dealer for sacrificing profit to stick with a national program; i can say that the dealer who does is one that is earning my business for now and in the future and one that i would recommend to everyone.	1
	after all, money is made over a lifetime - not on one deal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2291#msg2291re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        hey, let me know when hma announces the $10k rebate on the genesis.	1
	with the dealer discount that would unquestionably follow along with such a steep rebate, i can see picking up a base genesis for around $20k + tl.	1
	shoot, that will only get you a strippo camry, or a civic these days!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2292#msg2292re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        yeah, dodge has to put $6000 on a ram to move them, i figure that you will see the same on the charger in a month or two..........................................                                the amanti and the genesis share almost nothing other than being 4 door and having a front engine layout.	1
	anyone that would drive both of these cars would have a really hard time making a comparison.	1
	by the way, i think hyundai has a 600hp, mid engine, 200+mph supercar that will be here in two years.	1
	priced at $49,995-$54495.	1
	they say it will blow a ferrari enzo off the road, but have the same interior appointments as a bentley arnage.	1
	but hey, who would buy that?	1
	it's still a hyundai, so it will need a $199mo lease or a $15000 rebate.	1
	i love reading the posts of the people that have actually driven the genesis.	1
	i'm glad to hear that those with butt's in seats have generally positive opinions.	1
	on an interesting note, i had a dealer offer me a genesis with prem plus for an elantra today.	1
	hope everyone has a great weekend.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2293#msg2293re: and that is just what i take away from the last [jeffreid]        not implying that the amanti or genesis is in the same category as far as the car itself.	1
	my point being is that you have two cars that have 'price points' higher than i think the brand will bear.	1
	the kia brand will not support a $30,000.00 sedan as proven with the sales of that model.	1
	the genesis will be the same thing.	1
	i am not saying the genesis is not a great car.	1
	i am saying the hyundai brand will not support a car will above $30,000.00  (even closer to 40k).	1
	as far as the dodge is concerned... you have high gas prices coupled with a brand ready to go under any day.	1
	i have even seen ads where the ram is discounted 10k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2294#msg2294re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        the hyundai brand supports an suv above $30k.	1
	why not a luxury sedan?	1
	i think what you are saying is, you would not pay over $30k for a hyundai.	1
	and that's fine, it's your money.	1
	but if you haven't yet taken a look at and driven what hyundai offers in this $30+k sedan, and you are in the market for such a car, i encourage you to do so.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2295#msg2295i drove the v-6; now waiting to drive the v-8        i drove the v-6 and i love the way it drives.	1
	i guess i'm getting on, but i like the isolation in the genesis.	1
	now i'd like to drive the v-8; it's only 2k more than a comparably equipped v-6 with the premium plus package, but i can wait until march to replace my dts.	1
	for those of you who can wait two or three months until the new car hype calms down, it might be worth your while in making a deal.	1
	i need the lease because it's a new car and i'd rather have hyundai take the risk until the car's residual value is proven.	1
	i'm expecting to get the lease deal on the v-6 with the premium package or the base v-8.	1
	the extra $1,000 for the premium plus package is all for wheels and i want the smaller ones anyway for ride comfort.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2296#msg2296re: genesis dealers [kenb757]        when the hype settles in a few months, the dealers will be more likely to make deals, especially with the economy being what it is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2297#msg2297electronics problem        my sister and brother-in-law purchased the third genesis sold in california and after a week began having problems.	1
	the abs light and several others lit up on the dash and the vehicle would not go into park.	1
	they left it at the dealer and after a week they were told the dealer found a loose connection and the car was ready for use.	1
	four miles down the road the lights came on again and they'll be taking it back to the dealer on monday.	1
	has anyone else had this problem?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2298#msg2298re: and that is just what i take away from the last [backy]        the veracruz sold 821 units in may.	1
	it's a slow seller.	1
	it should be noted that may was one of hyundai's biggest months ever.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2299#msg2299i don't believe it        i am curious about posts that list extensive issues with quality or reliability, since i have owned numerous vehicles from this company and have never had such issues, nor have family members.	1
	also, this model was extensively tested and had nearly a 12 month run in korea to ensure that there were no such issues.	1
	i will not believe that they dropped the ball on this very important launch.	1
	nearly $300 million of rd was spent and it's just tough to believe these posts.	1
	could it be that the aforementioned issues are really hypothetical exaggerations?	1
	i certaintly believe so.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2300#msg2300re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        yes, but like all automakers hyundai is having trouble selling big suvs now.	1
	their smaller cars caused the surge in sales in may.	1
	still, that's 821 people (and over 6000 ytd) who bought a hyundai vehicle that easily passes $30k, and they bought it in a down market for big suvs.	1
	which contradicts the assertion that the hyundai brand can't support a car that costs over $30k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2301#msg2301re: genesis dealers [richard124]        my dealer got 3 genesis 3.8 v6's in yesterday.	1
	they called me to come see them.	1
	they are beautiful cars and i will test drive one next week.	1
	however i noticed the factory sticker with price and right next to it was a handwritten dealer add on for over $5,000.	1
	i didn't discuss it with the sales manager and the salesman did not know what it was for.	1
	i am not presently in the market but they know i am interested so the call.	1
	i can be sure of one thing though, if they are 'gouging' they will be hard pressed to sell a car for $38,000.	1
	in a dealership that pushes elantras and sonatas and very few azeras.	1
	red carpet prices in a non red carpet dealership.	1
	i have told them they can't market the car with their present mindset.	1
	remains to be seen if hyundai drops the ball like they have done with the azzy.	1
	i have an 06 azera limited and 06 sonata lx 6. happy with both cars, but the genesis is one beauty.	1
	don       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2302#msg2302re: genesis dealers [drdonrs]        yea, and there's some folks who pay msrp for a lancer (right, iluv?	1
	).	1
	so these dealers who tack on the additional charges probably figure there's a few buyers out there who'll pay over msrp for a genesis.	1
	not very many though, i bet.	1
	this too shall pass.	1
	personally, i think the appropriate reaction to a sticker like that would be a hearty laugh, wipe the tears from your eyes, and tell the sales manager, 'thanks, thanks very much.	1
	that's the best laugh i've had in a long time!'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2303#msg2303re: and that is just what i take away from the last [backy]        the 821 number is so small in comparison i do not believe it 'contradicts the assertion' that hyundai can support selling a $33,000.00 to 35,000.00 (base v6) vehicle.	1
	check the numbers on the ford edge and 821 pales in comparison.	1
	the veracruz is considered a 'cross over' isn't it?	1
	when you talk a 'big suv' i think one would refer to the ford expedition, chevy suburban, etc.	1
	hyundai doesn't have a 'big suv'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2304#msg2304re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        then i guess toyota should stop selling lexus sedans, because it could only sell 631 lx suvs and 830 gx suvs last month.	1
	(those are the lexus 3-row suvs.)	1
	ford edge is not a 'big' suv.	1
	it's in the same class as the santa fe, not the veracruz.	1
	ford sold 9993 edges in june, compared to 5863 santa fes.	1
	ford has nothing like the 3-row veracruz crossover right now.	1
	the closest thing is the taurus x crossover, which sold only 2217 units in june.	1
	i still contend that 6348 people (veracruz buyers in the first half of 2008) is a bigger number than zero.	1
	(i was a math major in school, so i am pretty sure about that.)	1
	which is the number of people you assert will buy a $30k+ hyundai sedan--zero.	1
	the veracruz sales demonstrate there are people who will pay over $30k for a hyundai.	1
	based on the long wait i had today at the discover genesis event, it appears there's considerable interest in the genesis--hyundai brand and all.	1
	looks like they at least have forgotten about the excel.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2305#msg2305re: and that is just what i take away from the last [chuck1]        i'm pretty much sure a loaded v8 can be had around 36-37k otd this time around next year.	1
	that's a great deal.	1
	world might not be ready for 42k loaded v8 hyundai's, but i'm sure they are ready for 42k loaded v8 minus $6000 under msrp.	1
	hyundai will sell 25-30k genesis and that's not that bad at all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2306#msg2306re: and that is just what i take away from the last [wolverinejoe80]        if the otd of a loaded v8 is 36-37k, the original price of car is about 33k-34k.	1
	it is 8k-9k under msrp.	1
	hyndai worry about reverse trading of genesis to korea                                the price of 3.8 v6 in korea is about 40k-50k(including tax; 10% of the total amount), so if hyndai sell 25-30k genesis, then hyndai give up the their business.       	1

	anyway, judging from the cars you bought, you may be a real car enthusiast.	1
	and i don't think that many car salespersons do their job because they love cars.	1
	most of them may just work for daily bread.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2316#msg2316big mistake        i think hyundai dealerships are going to regret trying to sell their cars above msrp.	1
	here in metro atlanta i saw two hyundai genesis selling for $4000 above msrp because of dealer markup.	1
	(no add-ons.	1
	just dealer markup).	1
	i think they are heading down the road toyota took when they launched the tundra and would not deviate from the msrp when trying to sell the truck.	1
	they told everyone they were selling the tundra at msrp and they were not lowering or negotiating the price.	1
	consequently, no one was buying them(including me) and they had to give rebates early on for a new redesigned truck.	1
	most people are going to wait until the genesis' price comes down anyway to buy one in my opinion.	1
	i would love for the genesis to succeed because it could cause lexus, bmw, mercedes, and infiniti to lower their prices.i think the genesis is a great car.	1
	i've sat in one(lots of room especially in the back) but haven't test driven one yet.	1
	i'm waiting for the v8.	1
	this is just my opinion.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2317#msg2317people, people, people...        what is all this over-reaction, this wailing and flailing, about some dealers slapping a markup over msrp on the first few genesis sedans to hit the u.s.?	1
	you folks are acting as if this is the first time any dealer has ever tried this tactic on a car in very limited supply.	1
	in my personal car-buying experience, i've seen dealers try the markup game many, many times over the past 30 years.	1
	hyundai dealers didn't invent it, and just for the genesis.	1
	some hyundai dealers tried it on the then-new sonata and azera in 2006.  i heard of at least one case of an adm sticker on a 2009 sonata!	1
	i'm sure a very small number of buyers 'bit' and bought these new designs at over msrp.	1
	but the markups disappeared quickly as the few 'gotta be the first in my neighborhood to have x' buyers were satisfied and supplies built up.	1
	this is a common, natural occurance in the car-buying world.	1
	no cause for alarm or panic.	1
	no cause for dire predictions that the genesis will fail because dealers are charging over msrp for them.	1
	those of you who don't want to pay a premium to grab one of the first genesis sedans in the u.s., simply wait a bit.	1
	prices will soon settle to their natural levels, levels that are sustainable over time.	1
	whether that means discounts below msrp or even rebates, and how much, remains to be seen.	1
	as many have noted, it's not a great time to be selling powerful luxury sedans.	1
	but already the genesis is priced well under its competition.	1
	how will they react?	1
	how many people will be willing to buy a genesis without thinking, 'it's a hyundai, so it has to be at least $5k off list or i won't buy it'?	1
	we'll see pretty soon.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2319#msg2319re: people, people, people... [backy]        well said there backy.	1
	may i remind everyone this is a simple concept - supply and demand.	1
	i am not one bit surprised by the markups on the genesis at current time - it was expected initially.	1
	come on, the local honda dealer is marking up the fit by 3k.	1
	this is nothing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2320#msg2320re: i don't believe it [joe97]        most spy shot of genesis was taken in u.s       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2321#msg2321re: people, people, people... [backy]        the point is that this is not the way to sell a new car or to get people interested in your product.	1
	if you went to the grocery store and saw a bag of lay's potato chips with the msrp of $3.49 would you buy them for $5.49 if the store was trying to sell them at that price?	1
	(i wouldn't) most stores either sell their items at the msrp (if it's written on the package) or at a lower price.	1
	(hot items may sell at a higher price but only if the msrp is not written on them) toyota lost customers because they refused to lower their price from the msrp and would not negotiate.	1
	so consumers starting buying fords, chevys, nissans, gmc's, and dodges because they lowered their prices and had big cash rebates.	1
	toyota lost sales and customers because they were (in my opinion) trying to be greedy with a new product thinking everyone was going to rush out and buy a tundra.	1
	i was going to buy a tundra.	1
	in fact i was going to buy a 5.7l double cab limited.	1
	but their tactics turned me away and now i'm glad i didn't buy it because i'm interested in the 2009 dodge ram 1500. and if the ram satisfies me i won't be buying a toyota truck ever because since this ram will be my first truck purchase i will be pleased with it and won't take the time to try another truck.	1
	it's one thing if genesis dealers sell their cars at msrp and many people are buying them.	1
	i can understand raising the price because the car is in hot demand.	1
	but they can't tell whether their car is in hot demand yet.	1
	so trying to sell above msrp doesn't make sense.they are going to turn off a lot of people who would otherwise have bought a genesis.	1
	those people may now buy something else.	1
	i would like to purchase the genesis because my last two vehicles were hyundais(elantra, santa fe) and i had no trouble with them.	1
	by the way i have a 2003 hyundai santa fe the kbb says is worth $9160.	1
	do you know anyone who will buy it from me for $13,160?	1
	if so please let me know.	1
	or better yet do you know any hyundai genesis dealers who will give me $13,160 if i trade it in on a genesis?	1
	if you do please let me know.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2322#msg2322re: people, people, people... [zone4]        if there were only 4-5 bags of lay's potato chips within a 500 mile radius of you and you really,                 really                wanted those lay's, then you might pay $5.49.	1
	or you might wait a few weeks until lay's ramps up their chip production and gets more chips into the stores in your area, so that prices come down.	1
	or it's possible that you'll go look for other chips.	1
	but what if they cost even more than the lay's??	1
	setting an asking price above msrp when you only have 1-2 of something and you really aren't that interested in selling them right at this moment because you wouldn't mind having them around for customers to look at and drive and build up demand, plus you know that some folks have been eagerly awaiting this new car for a long time (how many posts are in this discussion, for example?	1
	), so there's some chance someone will actually pay over msrp for the cars... that seems like a sensible enough thing to do, to me.	1
	what would not be sensible is a dealer letting several genesis sedans sit on the lot for many months because they won't sell them at or below msrp.	1
	but then, i don't own these dealerships.	1
	those gen 1 santa fes... are they pretty rare in your area?	1
	as in, maybe only 1-2 around?	1
	and every competititve model of suv costs a lot more than those 1-2 santa fes?	1
	or are they readily available for sale, as well as many competitive used suvs at around the same price?	1
	i'd guess the latter.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2323#msg2323i am getting it!	1
	i agree; a lot of dialogue about mark-up above msrp sticker prices that will just go away in a few weeks anyway.	1
	not really worth the time wasted in discussing it imo.	1
	on a separate note, i test drove a 3.8l w/tech package in bloomington, mn today at the genesis tour event.	1
	it completely exceeded my expectations - which were already very high.	1
	quiet, luxurious, loaded...  this sealed the deal for me and i am pulling the trigger as soon as the tech packages arrive in mn.	1
	the first two dealers i spoke to here are honoring the lease package so that is positive news.	1
	oh, and the best part of the event today was the $500 coupon that goes towards either a purchase or lease on the genesis (and is above and beyond the national lease package or military special deal).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2324#msg2324re: people, people, people... [zone4]        1) your dealer has limited quantities of genesis available, two to be exact.	1
	2) dealer anticipates the demand  supply                                looking at this from the a dealer's pov - let's say the dealer sold both units at or below msrp, they would then be sitting duck with nothing to advertise, market, and sell on the genesis.	1
	side note, there is an added benefit with the arrival of the genesis family (sedan and forthcoming coupe), hyundai is anticipating increased foot traffic into showroom - which obviously would help the genesis but also other proudcts within the hyundai fleet.	1
	until your dealer has a new batch arriving or anticipate to in the near future, why not mark up within reasons to see if anyone would bite.	1
	they are in no hurry to sell until more untis arrive, because those genesis will be sold, mark my words                                like backy said, this certainly isn't anything new.	1
	this has been expected, actually.	1
	some challenger has been marked up as much as 15k, with no test drives - have we been discussing that at the dodge threads yet?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2325#msg2325re: i am getting it!	1
	[viking967]        hey, i was there yesterday (per my earlier post)!	1
	how many people were there today?	1
	i had to wait 45 minutes, with about 50 people in line ahead of me.	1
	i drove the loaded 3.8 also.	1
	very sweet.	1
	did you drive any of the comparison cars?	1
	i drove the cts.	1
	no contest--genesis topped it handily, and is about $10k less by list price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2326#msg2326re: people, people, people... [backy]        my only complaint is that i think they are going about it the wrong way.	1
	that's just my opinion.	1
	also i'm a  little disturbed because i read an earlier blog that said someone was having electrical problems with a brand new genesis.	1
	i know problems arise but they just started selling these vehicles.	1
	how can they justify raising the price when already their having problems?	1
	in my area i've only seen black and silver colored genesi with mostly black interior.how about your area?	1
	my only major complaint is that the unside of the trunk lid is not covered.	1
	no major issue but they could have covered the underside without covering the speakers.	1
	the dash could have been a little bigger.	1
	other than that i think it's a great car.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2327#msg2327re: people, people, people... [joe97]        yeah, one may bite.	1
	but i bet he'll lose more customers that way.	1
	if the price was lower he may really get people biting then maybe can increase the price.	1
	like the old saying you can catch more flies with honey that with vinegar.	1
	of course i could be wrong.	1
	just my opinion.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2328#msg2328re: people, people, people... [zone4]        and the genesis' competitors never have any problems?	1
	mercedes, for example, is bullet-proof?	1
	i don't think so.	1
	if hyundai had to cut corners to get the price starting at $33k, then i can live with an unlined trunk lid.	1
	but it's curious why it's not covered, since that wouldn't cost a lot to do.	1
	heck, the aveo sedan has a lined trunk lid.	1
	(not that i'd want to own an aveo, though, but the trunk lid has a plastic lining.)	1
	i'm not a fan of big dashes.	1
	i almost gagged at the bigger dash on the cts, for example.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2329#msg2329re: i am getting it!	1
	[backy]        i saw your post from yesterday and told my wife that i may end up waiting in line too - but it actually worked out pretty slick.	1
	i had a 4:00 pm appointment and showed up 15 minutes early.	1
	there were probably only about 20 people in the tent/drive area and only three people in front of me in line.	1
	didn't surprise me because they were only open until 6:00 pm today.	1
	most people probably went yesterday.	1
	i only had a short window of time so i didn't comparison test the other vehicles.	1
	they had the exact vehicle i want right inside the tent:  v-6 tech titanium gray w/black interior.	1
	i can't wait to get it!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2330#msg2330re: people, people, people... [backy]        you nailed a couple of things in my opinion backy.	1
	the economy is not good right now for this launch-time to play hardball and negotiate.	1
	i bought a 3.8l genesis for $1500.00 under msrp, free tint, etching and paint sealer and a reduced documentation fee-exactly the car that i wanted.	1
	the first dealer that i was going to buy from wouldn't budge from msrp and told me that no one else would either-not the case.	1
	the other thing is throughout this thread we have only seen one entry for an electrical problem.	1
	no one wants to go to the dealership for repairs with a new car, but with the excellent warranty isn't it nice to know you are covered.	1
	i live in arizona, and the dealers here in the valley, except for one, have all added 'market adjustment' to their cars.	1
	i walked into the dealership that had my car at $36,000.00 msrp plus a $1995.00 market adjustment and some other stuff that brought it up to $38900.00 asking price.	1
	i showed the salesman 3 quotes from california hyundai dealers for $33888, $34100 and $34500 for the same exact car along with the names and contact info for the dealers so they could verify.	1
	a $215.00 flight will get me over there and i can buy in ca-shared the price of the flight with the salesman also.	1
	i also showed him my approval letter for my prearranged auto loan.	1
	it took 10 minutes for the general manager to show up and drop the price to $34500.00 and add the tint, etch, paint sealant, reduced doc fee that i mentioned above.	1
	if you are prepared and bring your research to the dealership and demonstrate that they can make a sale if they are flexible-it goes a long way to 'getting er done'.	1
	you have to be ready to pull the trigger-the hyundai dealers want more genesis and won't get more allocated until they sell what they have.	1
	they are still making money on the car and i feel that i got a decent deal-they were extremely cooperative.	1
	just wanted everyone to know that if you are patient, in this economy-there is absolutely no reason to pay the market adjustment-relax and find your deal.	1
	win for the consumer, dealer makes money-and no one got hurt in the process.	1
	by the way-this car is awesome.	1
	titanium gray/black interior-premium plus pkg.	1
	as i posted earlier-the v8 that i drove before purchasing the 3.8l was disappointing-totally different suspension and road feel from the 6 cylinder.	1
	the 4.6 does have some get up and go for sure-wasn't thrilled with the ride or the handling-not sure why it is so different.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2331#msg2331re: people, people, people... [deeezldoc]        what dealer in arizona did you buy from?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2332#msg2332re: people, people, people... [backy]        never mind the genisis, my local hyundai dealer has an adjusted market value sticker of  $1,797 on every car on the lot, yes, even the accent and elantra!	1
	and this has been the case for a few years now, not something new.	1
	i am assuming that they will have at least that much on the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2333#msg2333re: people, people, people... [zone4]        based on my inspection of the car, and talking with the dealer, which by the way, is selling at msrp                , no  reports of electrical problems, so that entry you saw                 might                just be an isolated issue.	1
	let's face it, no one car is perfect, even the best of best.	1
	on that note, another area which may not have been covered extensively yet - the fit and finish on the genesis is superb.	1
	certainly hyundai has done their homework to acheive the highest standard possible.	1
	the paint job, also, was nothing short of spectacular.	1
	how can they justify raising the price when already their having problems?	1
	go ask the your local dealer.	1
	hyundai certainly isn't dictating the markup.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2334#msg2334re: i don't believe it [joe97]        not for a minute.	1
	but to run a couple of 'test mules' around death valley' for a couple of days still doesn't simulate the millions upon millions of miles that real drivers put on the combined numbers of cars sold.	1
	if this was the case we wouldn't experience recalls.....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2335#msg2335supply and demand        i think those who want to be the first to own a genesis will probably end up paying 3 or 4 thousand more than those who wait four to six months.	1
	i remember when the playstation 3 first came out, people were willing to pay exorbitant amounts to be the 'first' to own one.	1
	those that waited just a few months later got one at msrp.	1
	that's just the way the capitalistic marketplace works.	1
	just think of it this way:  the genesis is a 2009 vehicle.	1
	come january 1, you can purchase one for msrp.	1
	but it you want one early -- three to six months -- then you can pay an extra $3000 or so.	1
	for some, it's certainly worth it.	1
	for me, i'll just wait until january or next spring.	1
	i can certainly be patient.	1
	i would like to hear all of the crash test results and owner opinions and reliability reports anyway.	1
	so, it would actually be better to wait.	1

	california only allows $55.00 for doc fees-arizona dealers regularly charge $400.00 - $500.00 because they can get away with it.	1

	the people buying now, otherwise known as 'first adoptors,' should prepare themselves for the day when the genesis version they purchased for msrp now is selling for as much as 8k less new, which will probably be about a year from now.	1
	but that's the price one pays for being an early adopter.	1
	this is not to knock the genesis at all.	1
	i know that i'll be licking my chops when i get a new genesis that has a msrp of about 36k for 29k or less.	1

	mercedes-benz is already there.	1

	hyundai is not established yet in the luxury division.	1
	as for the dash boards we both have our likes and dislikes.	1

	i can buy floormats at wal-mart, target, pepboys, etc.	1

	another is i wish the cd slot console didn't jut out like it does.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2339#msg2339re: supply and demand [hebrewhammer]        i am just curious as to how the 'projected' pricing is being calculated.	1
	i am seeing expectations of $7000-$10000 off msrp in a year or so.	1
	if the genesis has $3000-$3500 total markup (including holdback), is there an expectation of a $4000-$6000 rebate?	1
	again, i am just curious.	1
	the largest rebate that hma is offering right now is $3500 (sf ltd), and if i use the veracruz as a baseline, then i think it would be very difficult to expect a $4000-$6000 rebate on the genesis.	1
	i do think that one will be able to buy the genesis at or slightly below invoice by january or february.	1
	but i think the idea of hanging in for a huge rebate is a wild goose chase.	1

	i walked into the dealer after test driving one at another dealership that wanted to play games and try to sell me the car at sticker price.	1
	at the 2nd dealership, i asked them to make their best deal, they slid an offer sheet across the table with a price of $26,081 for the azera w/premium package (sticker was just under $28k).	1

	what amounts to a 20-30% discount is what the car buyer                 expects                to pay for a 'korean' or 'american'  product( 10-20% below invoice) hyundai would be better off inflating the price 10 grand or so, just so the buyer 'thinks' he/she got a good deal when it sells for a large discount - the buick approach.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2348#msg2348re: supply and demand [captain2]        captain, captain, captain...poor and mediocre fe ratings???	1
	i thought we went over this already.	1
	fe ratings on any hyundai are maybe 1-3 mpg off of any comparable model of toyota, so if hyundai is poor and mediocre, i guess toyota offers mediocre and average fe ratings, huh?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2349#msg2349re: discover genesis - bloomington [backy]        i was at the discover genesis event in bloomington also.	1
	my observation was similar as to the wait time.	1
	i did some investigation and the event is put on by a public relations firm for hyundai, not hyundai.	1
	like many have discovered at dealerships, i knew more about the car than their product experts.	1
	i was given a nice car wash kit and a $500 coupon.	1
	i went to a similar event at the mn state fairgrounds several years back when mercedes was introducing the ml.	1
	same thing.	1
	long waits.	1
	very short course.	1
	lack of organization.	1
	so i think it is not an exclusively hyundai problem.	1
	about the car:  i was very impressed with fit and finish and driving dynamics.	1
	i drove the v-6  and the v-8.	1
	the v-8 may have been a preproduction car based on the wheels.	1
	i didn't find a marked difference in the driving dynamics between the two (i expected a big difference based on what i had read).	1
	i curiously observed no difference in the leather seating (again, i expected a noticeable difference).	1
	good stereo.	1
	i cranked a cd with the doors closed and my brother standing outside could not hear it, so the insulation is good.	1
	i had no trouble breaking the rear tires free on the skid pad (which is concerning in snow country).	1
	i comparison drove the e550 mercedes.	1
	the genesis was every bit as nice inside, and much bigger inside.	1
	the genesis leaned much less when pushed hard into corners and felt faster.	1
	the mercedes was supposedly a $68k car.	1
	not as nice.	1
	i was very impressed.	1
	i just came off lease on an 2005 sts4 (completely loaded all wheel drive cadillac).	1
	i loved that car but the residual was too high to not take a bath if i bought it.	1
	i may get another (they lease pretty well).	1
	but i like the genesis.	1
	i wish it had the adaptive cruise, which worked great on my caddy.	1
	lots of other toys though, such as the back up camera, dvd, rear window screen, etc.	1
	i really like the car and am leaning toward a v-8 tech whenever they arrive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2350#msg2350re: discover genesis - bloomington [mnjasper]        mnjasper...after reading your review, i was surprised to find out you had no trouble getting the rear wheels to break loose.	1
	when i test drove a 3.8 w/premium plus package, i stomped on the gas while the esc was still engaged and at best managed a little chirp, but nothing major as the traction control kicked in.	1
	however, when i disengaged the esc...let me tell you, the back end broke loose like a re-enactment of a dukes of hazzard episode.	1
	i did this on dry, smooth pavement which was a thrill, but the pleasant surprise was how easily controlled the car remained.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2351#msg2351re: supply and demand [joe97]        'poor and mediocre'  = less than 25 mpg                 overall                these days.	1
	for example - toyota - was recently out shopping the current avalon and although i never got down to brass tacks was led to believe that some serious dollars could be had at or below invoice - for what amounts to be the first time in the current model's history  - a car that leads the pack fe wise.	1
	the genesis certainly falls well short of that 25mpg (overall) definition, the perceived 'gas guzzling' avalon at least comes close.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2352#msg2352re: discover genesis - bloomington [allmet33]        still liked the car.	1
	alot.	1
	but on the wet tarp it let loose.	1
	(your's sounds like more fun, though).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2353#msg2353re: supply and demand [allmet33]        yes, allmet - as per my previous post even the full size avalon is starting to have difficulty moving off of toyota's lots - its too big and eats too much gas at least according to the dealer folks i talked to that were trying to sell me one.	1
	so where does that leave everybody else?	1
	as for cafe ratings - i think you'll find that the toyota and honda fleet averages have led the pack for many years now.	1
	my point is that once 'economical' cars are falling victim saleswise to a new definition of what 'economical' really is and this has happened to your azera as well as my avalon.	1
	long live the 4 banger and the econobox !        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2354#msg2354financing rate from hmfc        does any one know if there are any special financing rates for genesis?	1
	i could not find anything on their website.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2355#msg2355re: article and 2 videos i came across [sg2k]        not to downplay the genesis here, but the 3.8 in the azera is quite capable of pulling off the same feat...with ease.	1
	i'm truly not surprised at all that the genesis with almost 30 hp and a better transmission is doing it.	1
	that being said...the 4.6 should be able do it that much easier.	1
	however, there are plenty in this forum that will deem this conversation as condoning unsafe behavior behind the wheel of a car.	1
	it is nice to know that if one needs to really, really get somewhere in a hurry, the genesis is more than capable of getting the job done (regardless of which engine is pulling it, er, uh pushing it).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2356#msg2356re: supply and demand [captain2]        captain, it's really not that the likes of the avalon or the azera are offering poor or mediocre fe, the fe rating is still just as good as it was when gas was $2.75/gal.	1
	the problem is...with gas now averaging $4/gal...folks want better fe and to do so, they have to downsize to get it, thus...the attractive 4-bangers.	1
	but in all honesty, it's not the fe ratings on the larger cars that's changed, it's the mindset of the people that has changed in what they desire to pay for not only a fill-up, but also how far they will get with each fill-up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2357#msg2357re: discover genesis - bloomington [mnjasper]        i understand what you mean, even with the azera's esc on, it's best to start out in 2nd gear when slippery conditions are present.	1
	i've noticed much less traction control activation when using 2nd gear starts.	1
	with more power in the genesis, i would think this technique would work as well.	1
	i certainly can't wait to see how much more fun breaking the back end loose is with the 4.6!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2358#msg2358re: genesis dealers [snaglepus]        i have already replied to this error on my part, but again, i should not have said 'costco' specifically.	1
	i made a general retail statement and made the mistake of putting that particular retailer's name in the post.	1
	however, i would like to point out that i am getting grilled about 'only' 14% markup after paying a membership fee.	1
	i will give out directions to my dealership to anyone that will pay me a membership fee and a 14% markup!!!!	1
	please do not remove this post, i am not soliciting business as this is just making a point!!	1
	i was just sayinig that the genesis at msrp is a 7% margin from invoice and that 7% is a very small margin for a retail sale compared to the margins that most fixed price retailers charge.	1
	even when you factor in holdback and other incentives that hyundai has available to earn, you still aren't getting to 14%, or close for that matter.	1
	matter of fact, if we really want to go down this road, we can start to talk about the higher costs of stocking higher dollar inventory compared to costco, or extra insurance, and all sorts of good stuff.	1
	makes that 7%-10% even smaller.	1
	it is 101 degrees here today and the fan in my office is out.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2359#msg2359re: supply and demand [captain2]        why would a buyer think he/she got a good deal when the price is already inflated $10,000?	1
	if a car has a msrp price of $35,000 and the dealer marks it up to $45,000 and then tells the buyer he/she will sell it for $32,000 you don't think the consumer knows he's getting only a $3000 discount?	1
	do you believe that the comsumer thinks he's getting a $13,000 discount?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2360#msg2360re: supply and demand [allmet33]         the problem is...with gas now averaging $4/gal...folks want better fe and to do so                no kidding - how else do you explain honda offering bought down financing rates (and invoice pricing) on that 4 banger accord that gets 23  or 24 mpg overall but then telling me that the pissant little fit was selling at sticker plus a $1500.00 'market adjustment'.	1
	maybe something the do with that fit seeing the plus side of 30 mpg pretty easily while that 'economical' 4 banger accord gives up 7 or 8 mpg.	1
	this is a terrible time for anybody to try to establish a new car (and correct a spotty reputation) with a car that by no means is going to win any fe awards.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2361#msg2361re: supply and demand [captain2]        well, given the genesis has one of the best mpg in the class, every luxury model, midsize and up, should be perceived as poor and mediocre in terms of fuel economy?	1
	i just don't think someone shopping for a $15,000 car vs. a $35,000+ car think the same in terms of f/e.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2362#msg2362re: supply and demand [captain2]        oh...i agree that timing stinks for any large car right now.	1
	however, they'll still sell (slowly) as folks hold out for gas prices coming down again...at least until it's shown over time that they won't.	1
	considering there is no advantage for me to upgrade to a genesis sedan at this point, my azera will be fine.	1
	however, next year...we may be looking to add the genesis coupe to our driveway so that my wife can have a car to run around in and we can keep the outlook parked in the driveway until family excursions occur.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2363#msg2363re: supply and demand [zone4]        this is the 'jewelry/furniture store' theory of marketing - mark something up high enough that you can then sell it for something a whole lot less and the american shopper will jump at it.	1
	50% off of what?	1
	buick, lincoln,  and cadillac have been doing it for years and years (at lesser percentages, of course).	1
	the vast majority of car buyers want to brag on their negotiated' car prices not understanding what they actually got is nothing  - for nothing.	1
	to answer your question - no, don't think the consumer knows much - and definitely think that hyundai would have better luck selling the genesis at a higher price but with a higher discount.	1
	kinda like a secretary of mine a while back that was all proud about some $200.00 boots that she paid $100.00 for - told her that what she actually bought was a nice pair of $100.00 boots, and that anybody that gave the $200.00 simply got ripped off....                as this would apply to the genesis, it simply means that those folks that do pay a premium to be the first owner on the block will simply be screwed big time later (primarily in resale values) if the car has to be discounted to the degree that many hyundai buyers seem to think they should.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2364#msg2364re: financing rate from hmfc [milan13]        hmfc is offering 0.9%-6.9% for 48mo, 1.9%-6.9% for 60mo, and 3.9%-8.5% for 72mo.	1
	hope this helps.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2365#msg2365re: genesis dealers [jeffreid]        this invoice and mark up business has always been confusing to me.	1
	how many times do you see sellers selling and buyers buying below invoice and quite frequently waaaay below invoice.	1
	hyundai does this all the time.	1
	if the invoice truly was the invoice and what the dealer paid for the car this would never happen.	1
	because of this your point has very little impact as i can't believe any dealer would sell below invoice unless they were somehow making a profit.	1
	please don't start with the gobblety gook about rebates, interest rates, trade-ins, etc.	1
	just give me a good straight forward honest answer and maybe your respect will go up on this board.	1
	thanks.       	1

	not so sure about that.	1
	notice recently that the lines at the 'discount' gas stations are getting longer even though the percentage price difference is a lot less than it used to be.	1
	doesn't make any sense does it?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2367#msg2367re: genesis dealers [houdini1]        businesses of all types frequently sell things below what it costs them even in absolute terms.	1
	have a friend that happens to own a number of different branded car dealerships - his claim that he (and pretty much all) dealerships lose money selling                 new                cars especially when you attach the correct portion of the business' overhead to costs - the dealer simply makes it all up (and then some) selling used cars and in the service dept.	1
	invoice, in effect, means  nothing even if it is a real number.	1
	as you say ' they are somehow making a profit' - just not necessarily on that new car they sold you.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2368#msg2368re: discover genesis - bloomington [mnjasper]         i had no trouble breaking the rear tires free on the skid pad (which is concerning in snow country).	1
	i didn't either, when i stomped on the throttle from a dead start on the wet plastic tarp at the test site.	1
	but i would never use that much throttle under real-world conditions.	1
	and even though the wheels spun and the rear wagged a bit, the car kept moving forward and ahead.	1
	i thought that was pretty darn good for a powerful rear-drive car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2369#msg2369re: discover genesis - bloomington [backy]        i agree with you.	1
	in the real world, i rarely drive on a wet plastic tarp.	1
	i thought about walking around asking for 'backy' after seeing on this board that you would be there, but decided discretion was the better option...                                one last thought from the peanut gallery ... i don't think you will ever see those massive mark-downs on this car.	1
	it will sell below msrp.	1
	but the manufacturing costs evidenced in the quality materials clearly are not those of a $25k car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2370#msg2370re: supply and demand [captain2]        i agree with you that jewelry and furniture is marked up and overpriced.	1
	but if what you say about consumers is true then maybe i should start selling cars.	1
	however, the msrp is mandated by law and furniture and jewelry prices are not so you never know what the dealer paid for those items.	1
	therefore it's easy to get ripped off.	1
	and speaking of the genesis i had a salesman tell me only 8,000 was going to be produced in its first year.	1
	does anyone know if this is true?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2371#msg2371genesis v8        anyone know when the genesis v8 will be in the showrooms?	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2372#msg2372re: discover genesis - bloomington [mnjasper]        i agree on the pricing.	1
	maybe we could see a sub-$30k deal on the base model, for example, but this car is so far above cars like the azera and avalon that i don't see the huge huge discounts on it.	1
	but i wouldn't mind snagging a well-maintained 2009 genesis 3.8 for around $16k in the fall of 2012, when i'll be looking for a car just for                 me                .        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2373#msg2373re: people, people, people... [deeezldoc]        i'd be careful, if i were you, living in az and all.	1
	according to chuck1, hyundai and its numerous engineers and experts from around the world never would have considered the possibility of the gensis being driven in such heat, as korean roads (apparently related to the general climate, according to chuck1) are                 not                american roads.	1
	make sure you have the hyundai roadside service # ready while driving - the car might catch on fire or simply melt.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2374#msg2374re: genesis v8 [mn778]        i was told in two months.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2375#msg2375re: supply and demand [zone4]        as you all are ware of, genesis sales goal is 80,000 worldwide next year, and the half of them are for non-korean market including us, china and so on.	1
	thus you can assume that 20~30k gens will be shipped and sold in na next year.	1
	and i don't think that this is that much large amount to cause an excessive supply and drive a drastic discount(10k?	1
	mentioned above).	1
	imho, selling some 2,000 cars per month in na(including canada) doesn't seem a way too high goal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2376#msg2376re: discover genesis - bloomington [backy]        if the genesis turns out to be reliable, i agree with you.	1
	it may just be the biggest steal of the century as a                 used car                , especially if hyundai depreciation rates hold anywhere near consistent.	1
	i'd never buy a new hyundai.	1
	let the first buyer eat the horrendous depreciation rate.	1
	be smart and patient, and you'll end up with a two year old $15,000 genesis with maybe 20,000 or 30,000 miles on it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2377#msg2377re: discover genesis - bloomington [hebrewhammer]        2 year old sonatas with 20-30k on it sell for $12-14k.	1

	i'm sorry, did i say test...i meant dog them out to make sure that in the most extreme heat...to make sure the cars will operate without fail.	1
	by testing a limited number of vehicles mean that all of them will be trouble-free...doubt it, but at least they know in general that their systems and components can handle the exteme heat.	1
	and if you think hyundai is the only company to do so, think again...there are quite a few automakers that take cars out to death valley in the dead of summer for the very same purpose...real world testing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2381#msg2381re: genesis dealers [houdini1]        houdini, i'm not sure that i even understand what your question is, so i'm a little unsure of how to answer you.	1
	i have been very clear on previous posts that hma does pay dealers additional incentives based on sales volume and csi/hsi survey scores.	1
	these payments obviously vary by dealer since volume and survey scores will vary.	1
	also, hma supports the stand alone hyundai dealers with a small extra payment per retail sale.	1
	there are also programs that run from time to time that pay the dealer to sell certain models.	1
	i'm sorry that i have little to no respect from you, however, i have been completely forthcoming in the past, and have no reason not to be in the future.	1
	by the way, the 'gobblety gook ' you mentioned really does play a huge part in most transactions.	1
	on a totally different note, i was told yesterday that the pearl white genesis' should be arriving in showrooms in the next 3-4 weeks.	1
	thought you guys would like to know.	1
	also, when these cars hit, there will be a number of others that were held back from the first genesis allocation that will hit the ground.	1
	this should provide for better selection, and maybe get some of the msrp+ markups out of the way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2382#msg2382re: financing rate from hmfc [jeffreid]        thanks.	1
	i have almost made up my mind to buy this car if i get a good finance rate from hmfc.	1
	anyone who can recommend whether i should check with the dealer directly for the financing option or should i take a pre-approval from a bank before talking to the dealer?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2383#msg2383re: financing rate from hmfc [milan13]        i know in some cases, walking in with pre-approval from another source is just like walking in with cash and you can make a better deal.	1
	i did that with the first new car i ever bought.	1
	with their financing, they weren't budging in the price and the monthly terms were higher than i wanted.	1
	i went to my bank, got pre-approved for a certain amount and i told the salesman that if he gave me the car at a certain price (ttl included), i would have a check on his desk the next day for the amount i quoted him (which was $2k below what they were going to sell it to me under their financing), not to mention my payment was like $75 less per month as well.	1
	the only time financing through them is great is if you can get a better interest rate, like when you see those deals for 0% financing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2384#msg2384re: supply and demand [zone4]         however, the msrp is mandated by law                huh????	1
	so i guess this is why they are selling a silly honda fit for 10% more than msrp and why if you call honda in california they will tell you something like 'actual prices are set by the dealer'.	1
	or why 'gouging' dealers can be found for the genesis right now and hyundai will tell you the same thing.	1
	or why the challenger is being sold above msrp.	1
	supply and demand will determine what any and all prices can be and if some salesman somewhere is telling you that very few genesis' willl be built, chances are he is simply trying to convince you to pay something too much for the car.	1
	if the hyundai dealers find out that they can get $100k for a genesis, rest assured they will, there is no law to stop them - and nor should there be.       	1

	that is he is asking $35,000 and $36,000 for a car with a list price of $33,000.	1
	some bargain over the internet.	1
	i wouldn't set foot in the door.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2387#msg2387re: lease $399.00 amonth [caraddict2]        caraddict2,                                yes, this is the national lease offered by hyundai usa.	1
	for the v-6 w/tech package ($40k msrp), the deal is:                                -- $499 per month                -- $1680 down                -- +tax and registration (some dealers may add a title/doc fee)                -- $595 disposition fee at end of lease if you turn it in                -- $26,400 to buy it at end of lease                -- $500 off the down if you have a coupon from the discover genesis tour       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2388#msg2388re: supply and demand [captain2]        yes, that's correct.	1
	the msrp sticker is mandated by law.	1
	the manufacturer can put whatever price they want to on the sticker.	1
	but if its a new car it must have that sticker which will include the price.	1
	if there is no sticker with the car price then the dealer is violating federal law assuming it's a new car.	1
	there's no law that says a dealer can't charge more than the sticker price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2389#msg2389re: lease $399.00 amonth [viking967]        quick question for the the dealers on the thread:                                the lease packages are based on the dealer selling the car at invoice price, correct?	1
	(that's what i though i read here and/or at genesisowners.com).	1
	if that's the case, wouldn't any dealer who was following the lease program sell the car at invoice if you approached them that way (e.g., instead of a lease, how about if i change to a ourchase)?	1
	it seems this would be the same unless there is some hidden leasing incentive they receive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2390#msg2390re: genesis dealers [jeffreid]        thank you for your reply.	1
	i did not mean that you got no respect from me.	1
	on the contrary, you have been very forthcoming.	1
	a bad choice of words on my part and i apologize.	1
	i am just not sure that i am ready for a hyundai yet but i am very impressed with the genesis.	1
	thanks again.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2391#msg2391tech package        tech package seem a little expensive for what you get.	1
	premium plus looks like a much better deal.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2392#msg2392re: tech package [caraddict2]        i guess it depends on what you're after really...if you get the tech package in the 4.6, it would make more sense than getting the 3.8 w/tech package ($2000 difference).	1
	what you get for that $2k difference is substantial too...80 hp, hid headlights, bigger better brakes, supposedly better leather (open for debate) and unique wheels that you can't get on any 3.8 model.	1
	$36k for a 3.8 premium plus is still a lot of car for that money.	1
	personally...i don't feel the tech package is worth a $4k add-on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2393#msg2393re: lease $399.00 amonth [ahah]        ahah,                                i will let one of the dealers respond, but as far as your reference to the lease program being based on invoice, i remember the post you are referring to.	1
	it was on the other forum and that poster had experienced a dealer that was trying to tell him that the published lease rate wasn't available because he wouldn't make any money.	1
	the poster went on to speak to some other dealers who agreed to offer the published lease.	1
	i would not take that posters comments and assume you can use that as the starting point for negotiating for purchase from invoice (but more power to you if you can).	1
	i debated leasing vs. buying the v-6 w/tech (i have never leased before) but i made the decision to lease.	1
	i think it is a vry good offer all around on this vehicle when you compare it to buying with a loan - imo.	1
	the first two dealers in mn i spoke to agreed to the published lease - in email - so i don't think it will be hard to find one if you have a little time...       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2395#msg2395re: people, people, people... [allmet33]        hey allmet, my post was one of sarcasm toward what was to me a ridiculous statement (that korean roads are not american roads) made by chuck1.	1
	i am fully aware of the fact that death valley tests are done, and, in fact, the genesis was geared toward the n. american market, and much of the freeway testing was done in california - which makes sense as the freeways in ca offer both the severe stop-and-go as well as open road crusing at higher speeds.	1
	another silly comment in that post also revealed that chuck1 is unaware of the harsh korean winters.	1
	'the mean temperature during winter is generally below freezing.	1
	the mean temperature in january in seoul is 3.5 degrees c. below freezing, while that of london is 4.6 degrees c. above freezing, and that of san francisco is 10.1 degrees c. summer in korea is hot.	1
	in most of the country, the mean temperature of hottest month is above 25 degrees c. except in the northern interior.	1
	the mean temperature of the hottest month for seoul is 25.3 degrees c. the annual temperature range between the coldest and hottest months for seoul is about 28.3 degrees c. the range of temperature is much greater in the north and in the interior than in the south and along the coasts.'	1
	(from                 http://user.chollian.net/~jis0523/korea-climate.htm                )                                sounds to me like a good place to test cars.       	1

	lol so how in the world can you buy a genesis for 15k?	1
	i was the one who originally postulated getting a 2009 genesis 3.8 in the fall of 2012 for around $16k + tl.	1
	so this is not a 2 year old genesis we're talking about, but a 3 year old car.	1
	alg estimates a 3-year-old genesis will be worth 50% of its msrp.	1
	do the math.	1
	that's an estimated $16.5k for the base genesis.	1
	definintely in the ballpark.	1
	also, i see that if i want, i can go down to a local dealer and pick up a 2-year-old loaded azera, list price around $31k, with 27k miles for under $16k asking price (final price--who knows?).	1
	so i think a 3-year-old base genesis around $16k is realistic.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2404#msg2404europeon mag: 'and the established order should feel distinctly threatened'        in this pair of tests the genesis v-6 and v-8 proved themselves almost identical in feel to the 530i, the heavier v-8 approaching the sensations of a 550i.	1
	with the genesis wheelbase at a class-leading 115.6 inches (overall length at 195.9 inches is roughly five inches longer than any competitors mentioned here), this                 agility was slightly surprising to us.	1
	the hyundai dynamicists have incorporated aluminum steering and suspension knuckles, aluminum front link arms and brackets, a sophisticated five-link suspension geometry at all four corners (as on the lexus), and a simple yet solid all-around amplitude selective damping system.	1
	nhtsa has just awarded the big genesis a five-star rating, too, in all front and side impact tests.	1
	one particular luxo touch that we noted immediately is the substantial laminated windscreen and front window glass.	1
	opening and closing the front windows is an absolutely silent operation  la rolls-royce.	1
	genesis is also the first car for sale in the u.s. with major use of fiber-optic technology for onboard systems, reducing the complexity and weight of a traditional wiring harness.	1
	a 5.8 second 0-60mph time and an electronically limited 155mph top speed prove it's no slouch.	1
	suspension feels soft by european standards, and the steering lacks centre-feel in hard driving.	1

	i did not receive a call from any dealer, although i've expressed interest and left my information with several.	1
	the closest dealer that i'll be visiting had 'no clue' what i was getting at when i asked 'do you have any models with the tech package?'	1
	he said he had a fully loaded model, but it had no navigation...... last i checked i wouldn't consider that fully loaded, but anyway.	1
	so, my next question was 'do you have the premium or premium plus?'	1
	he replied...'huh'  i asked if it had the larger wheels and he seemed to feel it didn't.	1
	the salesperson explained, 'we haven't gone to jersey for training yet for the genesis, we have to go all the way down there.'	1
	do these guys even consider using the internet?	1
	although he seemed like a good guy with much energy, he said, 'when you come in you can tell me all about the car since you seem to know more than i do.'	1
	this statement was not sarcastic at all, he was serious about his lack of knowledge about the car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2409#msg2409re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [readyformyrl]        if i was a owner or manager at a hyundai dealer, i would make it mandatory that anyone at my dealership selling genesis review this web site to get the latest on what is going on regarding the genesis.	1
	i for one, know more about this genesis new release than the dealer sales personnel and even management in calif because of all the national input to this site.	1
	you really have to question where we buy when we know more than the dealer representing hyundai and genesis.	1
	one would ask if the sales personnel  are lost in space with genesis and service is right beside them.	1
	if the sales personnel lack the knowledge of the product is service in the same space.	1
	would sure be nice to have a hyundai senior executive jump on this site!!	1
	having been following this site for some time i have been very  very impressed with all the information that has been made available.	1
	i have not been impressed with hyundai the company thus far.	1
	perhaps they will get their act together in order to play with the big boys.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2411#msg2411dealership issues!!!	1
	earlier it was posted that a certain hyundai dealership in alexandria, va was terrible in terms of salesman knowledge and assistance.	1
	well, i just happened to go back one day and i took my wife with me so she could get a look at the new genesis.	1
	we walked in the door and immediately to the left, there was a salesman sitting at his desk watching a movie on his computer.	1
	now i wasn't expecting anyone to get up to help me as they pretty much know me there and i wasn't a potential sale...yet.	1
	but, i witnessed others walk in and it almost seems like a seat yourself, help yourself buffet style restaurant up in there.	1
	i can definitely see where hyundai is going to have to make some changes to support the genesis on the front end (in the least...start there) and then work all the way back to post-sales customer support in the service department.	1
	which...i can vouch for the same dealer as having a top notch service department.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2412#msg2412re: dealership issues!!!	1
	[allmet33]        imo there is a fine line between an overbearing salesman and one that is simply ignoring you.	1
	you should have at least been greeted with a 'hello, welcome to xxx hyundai'  its just nice customer service/relations.	1
	at my local yota dealer i always get a hello and a 'may i help you' when i walk in.	1
	on another note, i will most likely be driving a genesis next week as my gf is picking up her elantra from the body shop at the dealer and her salesman said there should be v6 for me to drive        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2413#msg2413re: dealership issues!!!	1
	[tjc78]        exactly right my friend...at least acknowledge the customer, give them time to look and if they show interest or look like they need some help...approach them, or heck...welcome to xyz hyundai, my name is such  such, let me know if you need any assistance (with a handshake of course) and then walk away.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2414#msg2414re: springfield mass [caraddict2]        i can speak to the wheel difference.	1
	i test drove the 3.8l v6 with the premium plus (18' wheels).	1
	the ride was firm, but not harsh, a little firmer than i prefer.	1
	also, i didn't care for the chrome accents on the wheels.	1
	i then asked the dealer to get me a unit with the premium pkg.	1
	(17' wheels) which i picked up this past tuesday.	1
	the ride on my car is only slightly less firm than the unit i test drove, and considerably more pleasant on the pot-holed and broken roads in northern illinois (we had an unusually harsh winter this past season, that did an extraordinary amount of damage to the roads).	1
	i prefer the non-chrome wheels; others may have a different opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2415#msg2415re: springfield mass [lakerunner4h]        you're not the first one that has said they like 17' wheels better, maybe in a hyper silver look...that would be slick!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2416#msg2416re: springfield mass [lakerunner4h]        should be easy for the dealer to take a premium plus car and put the 17' wheels/tires on it, deduct $1,000.00, and sell it as a premium car.	1
	are there differences in the tire brands and specs between the packages, or is just the size different?	1
	if just the aspect ratio is different (i.e., 55 vs 50), the only difference might be the 55s would have a slightly softer ride due to the higher sidewall.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2417#msg2417re: springfield mass [genesis6]        i don't think it would be that easy up front...maybe later on down the road.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2418#msg2418re: springfield mass [genesis6]        it is not that easy to change wheel size.	1
	it is more than just the wheel.	1
	most cars have specific wheel ratio set based on the radius of the wheel so that the odometer (speedometer) regesters the correct speed and the transmission shift spots.	1
	most of these can be adjusted by aftermarket tools if you want to change it.	1
	the tools are manufacturer/car specific with instructions.	1
	also, your dealer can do it too.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2419#msg2419re: springfield mass [ljf]        actually...it is easy to change as long as you keep the overall diameter the same.	1
	if you notice...the 17' wheel has a 55-series tire and the 18' wheel has a 50-series tire.	1
	the overall diameter is going to be pretty close to each other for that very purpose.	1
	there is no tranny difference between a base model or one with a premium package vs. that of the premium plus package.	1
	it might be a good thing for the dealer to match folks up that end up with the 18' wheels, but want the 17' wheels to the folks that have the 17' wheels, but want the upgrade to the 18' wheels....simple swap takes care of everything.	1
	personally, i would love to see an 18' version of the 17' wheel.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2420#msg2420re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [dave174]        40k doesn't go far these days.	1
	a loaded acura v6 tl with navigation is almost 40k, and g35's with navi and some options are over 40k.	1
	reality check is that cars are expensive anywhere you go.	1
	people need to notch down their expectations with hyundai.	1
	customers want to buy everything 3k back of invoice the 1st 90 days a car comes out.	1
	you wouldn't expect that at a lexus dealer.	1
	you'll have to 'work around' hyundai sales people and find out stuff on your own, and not expect the donald trump treatment.	1
	the genesis is a heck of a car for the money, especially in v8 form compared to lexus and infiniti.	1
	less money usually always means less service.	1
	i'll be glad to keep $15,000-18,000 extra money in my pocket by not going to the lexus dealer and sit in their 6 million dollar showroom and have people fall all over me.	1
	i'm smart enough to buy things inspite of salespeople.	1

	since the finance person was the only person available at the time, she kindly took me for a demo once i was finished getting acclimated to the interior.	1
	very solid and smooth ride....i did not realize the driver's seat was not cooled unless you had tech package.	1
	she was totally unfamiliar with the car so she explained up front that she didn't know anything.	1
	the other intersting note was the bluetooth function will not integrate into the steering wheel and radio unless you have the tech package.	1
	it had a separate interface (that was on-star like) near the sunroof panel.	1
	when you press the button, it does not interface with the radio so it has a separate volume control independent of the stereo.	1
	i thought that was odd.	1
	other than that, i was hoping i would see buttons to knock down the rear head rests like my rl, it may have been there, but i didn't notice and i couldn't find the button for the rear shade either...i would assume this does exist, but again, nobody knew enough about the car.	1
	and for the price........$2500 market adjustment, because they only have eight allocated and they're selling like hotcakes(i'm being sarcastic).	1

	turn esc off and there is a huge difference.	1
	i own a genesis 3.8l premium plus and everyone that has seen and ridden in it-is amazed that this is a hyundai.	1
	doesn't seem underpowered to me.	1
	if you're expecting the v8 to be radically different-it isn't.	1
	i've driven the v8 and the suspension feels totally different-very stiff and i couldn't wait to give the car back after the test drive.	1
	the v6 has a much better ride-and most of the people that i know here in arizona that have driven it noticed it as well.	1
	by the way-there were a bunch of posts last week about concerns about the ability of the genesis to handle arizona heat-complete nonsense.	1
	it was 110 degrees f yesterday afternoon and my genesis ran at 85mph and the temp indicator is still below 1/2.	1

	why did it feel underpowered?	1
	compared to what vehicles?	1
	i don't think 0-60 in 6.2 sec is possible for the car i tested.	1
	why is the 6.2 sec time not possible for the car you tested?	1
	what was different about it?	1
	it feels no better than a camry or a azera to me.	1
	does that mean the reviews from edmunds, car  driver, motortrend, road  track, autoblog, automobile, wards, winding road, etc comparing it to a bmw 530, lexus gs, mercedes e series are inaccurate?	1
	i am asking if you can give us a little more insight to your test drive experience because i have driven the above listed cars but have not yet driven the 3.8 or 4.6 genesis.	1
	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2430#msg2430v8        just saw a v8 in the bay area.	1
	it was priced at $40k.	1
	wrong color for me but wanted people to know that it is out there.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2431#msg2431re: first test drive a 3.8 with premium [cartech86]        not to be critical, but the camry is a mid-size (actually smaller than the sonata!)	1
	versus a large car class on the azera, and then the genesis is bigger than the azera.	1
	i am speaking of interior volume here.	1
	maybe from the front seats there isn't a huge difference, but i think if you were to look toward the back seat room, then one would see an enormous difference.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2432#msg2432        had a chance to check out a genesis v6 yesterday w/ all the bells.	1
	very impressive overall, really like the seats.	1
	currently own a 07 g35 and although the gen isn't a threat to the gs performance/agility/handling, it is a great choice for the price.	1
	if i were needing more back seat room and a truly superb highway cruiser this would be atop the list.	1
	very solid and refined, the middle console (housing the shifter gate) looks a bit cheap, and the little chrome inserts in the wheels look a bit sub-par, but that's about the only nits i could find.	1
	i find it a bit odd that hyundai would try to hide from themselves as far as debadging the front grill.	1
	hyundai has plenty to be proud of, and coming from a previous sonata limited owner i can attest that they've improved more than any other auto maker and continue to get better.	1
	it'll be interesting to see how the gen coupe w/ v8 does in terms of g37  bmw 335 comparisons (although the gen is closer to m35/45  bmw 5 in size  weight).	1

	your way off.	1
	hyundai is the fastest growing car company on earth.	1
	the only reason a hyundai sonata is less money to buy used is because its less money to buy new compaired to  the toyota camry.	1
	you can buy a fully loaded sonata v6 limited with nav , it will be a 2009 model, and come with a warranty that will out last even the 72 months most people finance these days.	1
	you can get all this for only $21,000.	1
	the fully loade!d v6 camry limited with the nav package will cost you $28,000.	1
	these number ar real.	1
	they are based on rebates avalible right now on both.	1
	this is the bottom line a dealer will do give or take a hundred.	1
	now thats 7000.  do the math.	1
	i own a 2007 hyundai elantra.	1
	its a se 5 speed.	1
	i drive 10,000 miles a year  and i bought it for 13,500 compaired to paying 17,000 for the corolla.	1
	so i can drive this vehicle till 2017 and be underwarranty.	1
	i paid 3500 less than the corolla.	1
	bottom line hyundai is toyota's biggest compeitor, right now and for years to come.	1
	i have driven the 3.8 tech pack and that vehicle is definatly in the class of the lexus.	1
	it may not be everything the gs is but its def.	1
	not in the same class as the avalon.	1
	i have owned an avalon and i did love it but you get more for the money with the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2434#msg2434re: discover genesis - bloomington [cnardi]        i am going out as far as to say the geneis is better than the gs, and many others in the class.	1

	i didn't know there were any v8s in the country at dealers for test drives.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2436#msg2436hyundai joins the big boys        i consider myself very knowledgable when to comes to cars.	1
	i always do extensive research (both online and in showrooms) before i acquire a new vehicle.	1
	i currently am driving a 2006 m45.	1
	before that, i had a 2002 tl type s, and, before that, i was driving a 1998 gs400.ordinarily, i would not have considered checking into hyundai, even though i am not a 'brand snob.'	1
	i just concluded through my research that the last three cars i drove were the best for me at the time.	1
	and all three were great cars.	1
	however, when i first learned of the genesis, i was very intrigued so i spent a lot of time online, researching the car.	1
	i was very impressed with all that i was reading, but, as always, the 'proof is in the pudding.'	1
	i stopped by a local hyundai dealer one afternoon just to ask about the genesis.	1
	it was not out yet and nobody knew when it would be arriving.	1
	but, since i was there, and still curious about hyundai, i ended up test driving a sonata and an azera and i came away very impressed with the build quality, the features and the way they drove and handled.	1
	i was convinced that i would get a sonata before a camry or an azera before an avalon.	1
	every day on my way home from work, i drive right by hyundai hq in fountain valley,ca as it sits right next to the n/b 405 freeway.	1
	one day as i was driving by, i just happened to look to my right and saw a red genesis sitting in their lot, facing the freeway.	1
	a couple of days later i saw another one, so i got off the freeway and eventually found hyundai hq.	1
	the receptionists inside had no info but said i could take a look at the car.	1
	i walked around it and looked inside and i was very impressed.	1
	without the 'h' on the trunk, one could easily mistake it for a lexus, bmw, mb or infiniti.	1
	a local dealer eventually got them in and i took a short test drive.	1
	they did not have any tech packages at the time, but i came away very impressed.	1
	i made up my mind that my next car was going to be a hyundai - if not a genesis then probably an azera.	1
	today i test drove a v6 titanium gray/black tech package.	1
	i put down a deposit and am just waiting to decide whether i want a two or three year lease.	1
	i should have it within a week or two, just in time to turn in my m45 which is at lease end.	1

	good sounding stereo                good amount of standard features                                things i didn't like:                                -ride is absolutely too firm                -on the highway, the car bounds up and down too much, even though suspension is too firm                -cel came on during test but it was most likely gas cap not being tightened by dealership monkeys, because the motor had no issues                -far more body roll around corners than competition                -poor rearward visibility                -numb steering on center                -leather was not aromatic or as soft and supple as a cadillac or lexus                -mismatch in color between dash and other parts of car                -ugly wheels                -no vault like solidity the german cars have when closing doors                -interior bits on dash feel cheap                -knobs feel cheap                                all in all, i can't say it's breaking new ground by either price, performance or looks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2438#msg2438re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [rjlaero]        well i just bought a different car than the genesis, partially due to the dealer experience.	1
	i test drove the genesis three times (one time was just around the block).	1
	i came back a fourth time and the salesman refused to let me test drive the car again even though i offered to gas it up.	1
	he said they don't want to get too much mileage on them.	1
	i saw 3 genesis and no customers at all.	1
	so i told him i'd think about it and went to a (non hyundai car dealership).	1
	there, i test drove a european car for the 4th time, plus an additional test drive just for the heck of it, the salesman coming along.	1
	i decided then and there to buy the european car...said salesman also offered to let me take it for a few hours.	1
	i have owned a lot of cars and am pre-disposed to like a hyundai having owned an amanti for 3 years (great for the money...).	1
	these cars depreciate a lot (i'm assuming the genesis will) and i'm one of those people who needs to have a decent amount of hands on experience with a car (especially a new model) in order to make a decision in which i'm sure to loose 15,000 dollars in two or three years.	1
	i use forums like this as a guide but i have to make my own decision and this requires lots of automotive touching and feeling (test drives) when buying a 40k car with no data points (no used cars on the road).	1
	i thought the genesis was very very good btw, except perhpas for the handling (slightly bouncy over bumps at freeway speed, the bumps would jerk the steering wheel slightly, maybe a tire inflation issue), but it is not really cheap compared to the slightly used and/or the discounted competition.	1
	mazda failed with the millenia (a very good car) and i think this car will fail too, in the sense of not generating enough sales to justify its existence.	1
	maybe it will do something for hyundai's other products.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2439#msg2439re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [stampy1958]          but it is not really cheap compared to the slightly used and/or the discounted competition.	1
	gotta agree here, although the gen is a nice step forward for hyundai and a very respectable vehicle, it's tough to put it in the 40k class, and is it really 10-12k better than an azera??	1
	once the v8 is out  proven it'll be interesting to see how the gen compares w/ the 40k rides.	1
	the few nits i had become more glaring when you put them in lexus/infinity comparos, and factoring in the assumed accelerated depreciation it makes it harder to justify the initial pricetag.	1
	once you see more of them and rebates/incentives take hold it could change the equation quite a bit, time will tell.	1
	hyundai seems to respond well to customer input, so year two may iron out a few of the nitpicks to further enhance the gen, looking forward to seeing how well the gen coupe is received as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2440#msg2440re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [blnewto]        i did buy an amanti 4 years ago mainly because at the street price (my buying price of 22.7k) i felt it was worth the trade offs.	1
	automotive journalists only evaluate on msrp of course, but when there's money coming out of my wallet, only the actual buying price matters, and nearly new (used) cars fit into the equation too.	1
	i did drive a mercedes c300 over the same bumpy highway as the genesis and there was no steering wheel jar at all.	1
	despite being noisier, smaller, slower, and less luxurious, the c300 had a clearly better suspension, so i imagine an e series would smoke the genesis in this respect.	1
	still, i probably would have bought the genesis if i could've gotten a similar discount as i did on the amanti.	1
	one other problem i had is the jog dial is really needed even on the base models for ergonomic reasons (like mercedes does in the c class), because it is much safer than reaching for the slightly reflective button cluster while driving.	1
	another gotcha for me was that only the driver's seat is ventilated with the p2 package (obviously engineered to the 40k price point).	1
	just make the car 40, 500 and ventilate both seats !       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2441#msg2441re: first test drive a 3.8 with premium [mnjasper]        the v8 that i drove belonged to hyundai corporate.	1
	they brought it to the phoenix area and allowed the 9 dealers in this area to keep it for a few days to give it out for test drives.	1
	i drove it for a good while on surface streets and on the highway.	1
	the v6 genesis that i bought has a better ride, the v8 is even more firm than the v6 and the suspension felt loose to me-it might have been the fact that this particular v8 had been test driven to death-but nevertheless i was not impressed and completely turned off by this.	1
	i bought the v6 and remain very pleased with this decision.	1
	some might simply want the v8-i have to say that i was disappointed with it-this is my opinion that others may disagree with.	1
	hope this helps.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2442#msg2442re: will dealer experience be the genesis' nemesis [stampy1958]         these cars depreciate a lot                                all luxury cars depreciate a lot, actually.	1
	given the predicted residual % on the genesis (66% after 2; 50%+ after 3), however, i would say the pre-conceived notion about resale values of hyundai models are changing for the better.	1
	it really started a few years with the introduction of the azera, and consistently followed up on each new iteration of change over models, with quality and reliability the driving force behind the improvement, and equally important, the parallel rising of perceptions on the brand.	1
	all in all, hyundai has certainly earned its good ratings from alg on the genesis, and residual values on this hyundai are certainly competitive when compared to the rest of the class.	1
	as its slogan has well placed,                 this is just the beginning        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2443#msg2443drove the v6 tech, v8 tech nd e550 back to back today        all were very sweet cars and definitely a cut above my current mitsubishi diamante.	1
	the v-6 and v8 were equally competent on the course that hyundai had set up for the vip drive genesis event.	1
	i went around the course several times and even on straight-line acceleration, they performed equally well (at least with me driving).	1
	acceleration and breaking were both equally good on the v6 and v8!	1
	both hyundais did better than the mb on the slippery mat (the mb stability controller was hyperactive and wanted to be my nanny), but the mb was better on high-speed hairpin turns on sandy loose gravel.	1
	the v-8 steering felt better and gave the feeling of more control than the v6, which was light.	1
	that was the only notable difference between the v6 and v8.	1
	the v-8 steering was closer to the mb.	1
	the leather in the v8 is the glossier version of what is in the v-6.	1
	i think i prefer the v-6 version.	1
	anyway, i think i'm gonna buy the v6 tech package version soon if i can get it for 38 grand even.        	1

	however, if you go hang out on the sonata 'prices paid and buying experience board' hyundai dealers are going to have to change the way they do business for buyers who are ready to pluck down the bucks that the genesis costs.	1

	i drove the e550 first.	1
	msrp about 65k.	1
	the ride is nice, seats are nice, handling is nice, interior is nice, abs test---car did so-so.	1
	then, went to the 4.6. msrp is 42k.	1
	the back seat has much more head and leg room.	1
	the seats have more cushion.	1
	doesnt have rear seat sunroof like the e550.	1
	power is similar.	1
	the handling is better in the mercedes.	1
	the parking back up system shows 2 green lines on the video screen to show the direction the car is pointed.	1
	nice touch.	1
	for the price difference between e550 and genesis, its a no-brainer due to initial cost and repair costs.	1
	however, mercedes claims to have worked out the bugs, now that they've gotten rid of some bad u.s. parts suppliers, and gone back to the german suppliers.	1
	question.	1
	:  how does it compare in value to infiniti g, m, cady, and bmr?	1
	for the options, the tech package includes cooled driver seat, turning xenon headlights for both 3.8 and 4.6.                                also, in the 4.6 with tech, the saddle brown colored interior is actually colored black for their black exterior cars.	1
	i don't know why.	1
	only diference between 3.8 with tech, and 4.6 with tech, is 1.  illuminated scuff plates,2.	1
	nicer leather,3.	1
	3.8 aisin transmission, 4.6 has better zf transmission, and 4.  chrome outer accents.	1
	and wood steering wheel interior.	1
	they gave me a 40$ gift kit with some car washing handles and sprayers.	1
	they also gave me 500$ corporate coupon, good to dec. 31, 2008.  they served water and red bull.	1
	that is why i am so pumped up and typing this message!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2447#msg2447re: went to test drive 4.6 [palmsprings]        i also went to test drive at the fedex field in dc yesterday.	1
	went for genesis 3.8, 4.6, then the mercedes e550.	1
	when driving the e550, the driver in front of me must have been going at 15 mph                , so i had to wait a while along the way.	1
	suppossedly the suspension is same for both versions of genesis, but the handling felt different somehow - i guess it's due to the different weight distribution ratio?	1
	the e550 definitely handled better and took lots of control on the skid pad (not sure if i liked that), but again the hyundai rep next to me reminded me it costs about $30k more than the genesis.	1
	the buttons by the mmc console had a cheap feel to it, and the door didn't close with a 'thump' like other luxury cars.	1
	i also didn't like the mmc control all that much, i prefer touch screen for speed.	1
	i couldn't really tell the difference in the 3.8/4.6 leather, and i'm not sure i prefer 4.6 transmission or the engine over the 3.8 - they were simply different, and 3.8 is quite powerful - so i'm having a hard time deciding which one is better.	1
	for the $500 coupon, i had to ask for one, they didn't hand it out as part of the test drive gift.	1
	so, remember that if you go test drive on the genesis tour.	1
	since it was a 40 min drive each way to get there, i had a lot of time to think about what i've experienced.	1
	i find myself being more undecided, as to whether spend a few thousand dollars more for true luxury car like infiniti m35 with definitive resale value or take a leap of faith on a new generation car with great _initial_ quality to price ratio.	1
	in the past, i normally pay for the car out-right and keep a car for 4-6 years.	1
	but with the genesis, i may consider leasing due to uncertainty in quality and residual value.	1
	but i'm not experienced in lease negotiation.	1

	you just spent 35k to drive a car for 3 years.	1
	a 44k top of the line v8 genesis would only have to be worth $9,000 after 3 years to cost you as much to drive as other higher end v8 cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2451#msg2451re: went to test drive 4.6 [netaddict]        we can analyze it to death (i am guilty of this), but in the end it comes down to how you feel about each and what is important to you.	1
	my wife and i drove the genesis, gs350 and bmw 530i on saturday.	1
	if they were all the same price and the same brand, i'd pick the genesis hands down, as would my wife (which is surprising because she didn't feel that way going in).	1
	it's not the same brand and service, so i expect some sort of a discount for that, which hyundai is giving.	1
	other key factors are:                - exterior styling -- personal pref, but the geneisis is more like an executive sedan in size and presence than the gs or the 535i.	1
	this is what i want right not.	1
	- interior -- everyone may not agree, but all in all, we thought the genesis had a nicer interior than the gs.	1
	i just couldn't get past the dash in the gs which seems just like an accord or a camry (no wood trim, leather, etc.)	1
	the only wood trim is near the shifter and on the doors.	1
	the 530i is just a different machine than the other two -- sportier, more compact --  and i think i've finally admitted to myself that i don't want this right now.	1
	as an aside, i didn't like the leather in the m35 when i drove one a few weeks back.	1
	- brand -- not that important to me, but it is to many.	1
	i thought the youtube of hyundai's head of prouct dev was telling (posted on genesisowners.com).	1
	their reserach has shown they'll do well with customers who have already had a lexus or bmw, not those upgrading from an accord.	1
	those who are upgrading really want the badge.	1
	those who have already owned a luxury brand are more likely to say ti was nice, but perhaps not worth the premium once the excitement wears off.	1
	- resale -- not an issue for those of you who lease.	1
	for those of you who buy, this is a red herring, i think.	1
	if it's worth 45% vs. 50% of original sale value after 5 years, that difference is just $2k.	1
	saving $2k is not a rational reason to spend $10k more for the lexus.....                                - performance -- the lexus and the genesis didn't seem very different at all to me based on normal driving.	1
	the bmw feels a bit sportier, but that's largely due to the fact that i test drove a manual transmission.	1
	just some points for you to consider.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2452#msg2452re: springfield mass [hebrewhammer]        first off, i have to ask what cars you are comparing it to when you say 'far more body roll than the competition.'	1
	every review i've read, by professional auto critics, said the body role and suspension was remarkable and only slightly short of bmw quality.	1
	i've not seen a single mention of any suspension issues.	1
	secondly, even the comments on the leather i have seen were positive.	1
	cadillac does not have great leather, it is soft, but hardly premium quality.	1
	i've had three lexuses (lexi) and while the leather was very nice i would put it a few notches below the audi's i have had.	1
	perhaps if your only two reference points are cadillac and lexus i can see why you feel the ride would be too firm.	1
	i'm sorry i just find your complaints unbelievable and unreasonable.	1
	if you are comparing it to an equivalently sized german car of course it will be left wanting, those cars cost $20-50k more.	1
	looks are wholly subjective and your impression is as valid as the next guy's.	1
	i'm not saying the genesis is on par with the best europe has to offer, but honestly what cars in its price range offer a better experience/package?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2453#msg2453re: springfield mass [hebrewhammer]         things i didn't like:                                    -ride is absolutely too firm                  -on the highway, the car bounds up and down too much, even though suspension is too firm                  -cel came on during test but it was most likely gas cap not being tightened by dealership monkeys, because the motor had no issues                  -far more body roll around corners than competition                  -poor rearward visibility                  -numb steering on center                  -leather was not aromatic or as soft and supple as a cadillac or lexus                  -mismatch in color between dash and other parts of car                  -ugly wheels                  -no vault like solidity the german cars have when closing doors                  -interior bits on dash feel cheap                  -knobs feel cheap                                ride was too firm???	1
	did you drive the model with 17' or 18' wheels?	1
	car bounds up and down???	1
	maybe a bad stretch of road since you said it happened on the highway...if suspension was bad, it would show up on surface streets as well, not just the highway.	1
	body roll???	1
	you complain of a too firm suspension and then turn and complain about body roll???	1
	funny, you seem to be the only person that has said that about the genesis.	1
	it's already been stated, the genesis is not a bmw, but for a luxury car...there will be some body roll as it's not a true sports car.	1
	poor rearward visibility???	1
	wtf                                numb steering on center?	1
	again...wtf                                non aromatic leather that's not soft and supple???	1
	okay...i'm not sure what you're definition of soft and supple is, but the genesis i sat in had leather that seemed to caress you...it made me wanna sit in that seat.	1
	depending on what color interior you get...yeah, that can be an issue, but if you don't like it...go for the black interior.	1
	ugly wheels...subjective, i like the 17' wheels as opposed to the 18' ones.	1
	no vault like solidity like that of german cars...it's not a german car!!!	1
	what part of the dash felt cheap?	1
	there was no plastic feel at all, unless you get the faux wood in the base model.	1
	if you get any trim above that...the dash gets the leather treatment and any place there is no leather, it's a soft-touch dash.	1
	not sure what you were expecting (considering it's a hyundai), you seem to be the only person on god's green earth that feels that the genesis isn't breaking new ground in what it offers in terms of bang-for-buck.	1
	then again, there always has to be one.       	1

	i do understand that some things are subjective such as ride comfort, looks and how one can feel about a car, but the stuff he's talking about....come on now.	1
	it just sounds like someone is hard pressed to knock the car when everyone else is finding minimal things to complain about concerning the genesis.	1
	honestly, the biggest complaint that anyone might be able to have is dealer support when it comes to this car.	1
	as another person posted, that is the one element that could be the nemesis of the genesis.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2459#msg2459re: springfield mass [allmet33]        here we go again!	1
	one person gives his honest impression of a vehicle and tries to point out to the rest of us things to consider.	1
	i appreciate it.	1
	if you don't agree, say you disagree and your impression of the car was better.	1
	i will wait until the professional reviewers and purchasers have an opportunity to do an in-depth drive on american roads of the genesis and rack up some mileage on the cars.	1
	i really like the concept of the genesis, but it appears not the 'super' car initially reported.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2460#msg2460re: springfield mass [carolinabob]        first of all, who are you to say how anyone should respond to a post on this forum.	1
	secondly, when one person's 'honest opinion' flies in the face of everything that has been written, by professional auto critics, about this car then that opinion should definitely be challenged.	1
	have you read any of the reviews about the genesis:                                road and track:                                the multilink suspension (coil springs and anti-roll bars front and rear)                incorporates lots of aluminum for reduced unsprung mass, and although u.s.                models are roughly 10-percent stiffer than their korean counterparts, the ride is                not too firm.	1
	sachs shock absorbers are valved for a plush ride on smooth roads,                then increase their damping for better wheel control on rough roads and in                cornering.	1
	the system works well, but when pushed hard, the genesis  even                with good 54/46 weight balance  tends to understeer, evidenced by an outside                front tire (size 235/50r-18) that howled on many of the test track's tight corners.	1
	on the high-speed oval, the genesis remained quite stable at triple digits, though                not quite as composed as the bmw 530i on hand for comparison purposes.	1
	that hyundai even had a 5 series on hand for comparison speaks volumes.	1
	clearly, hyundai is proud of the genesis, and this shows inside, where there are                gobs of space and a gently curving dash that looks especially rich, dare i say                european, covered with attractively stitched leather.	1
	most people would never                guess this is a hyundai.	1
	the ambience is heightened by hyundai's driver                information system, controlled through a multifunction knob that commands the                hdd navigation, voice recognition, bluetooth and xm/hd radio with a 30-gig                hard drive.	1
	car and driver:                                the suspension, as well, is as sophisti cated as they come.	1
	the four main links                on the two front corners are each attached to the hub with a ball joint.	1
	this                arrangement locates the steering axis much closer to the center of the tires                contact patch than it would with a conventional unequal-length control-arm                suspension, which should im prove steering feel and reduce bump steer.	1
	its an                expensive setup, made more so by the use of lightweight aluminum for the links,                knuckles, and brackets, and fur ther evidence that hyundai is making a serious                effort here.	1
	that front suspension setup also hints at a yet-unannounced four-                wheel-drive version because that arrange ment reduces torque steer.	1
	the rear                suspension knuckles are aluminum as well, connected to the chassis with five                links.	1
	the power steering is hydraulically assist ed, but an electric pump supplies                the fluid pressure, which hyundai says increases fuel economy by 2.7 percent.	1
	the only reports of the genesis being a 'super' car were in relation to its price point.	1
	no one ever said that this was the equivalent of a $80k luxury sedan, only that it offered features that could only be compared to a car of that stature and not to cars within its own price range.	1
	apparently, both you and the hammer have been afflicted with the same condition, believing nonexistent claims about the genesis, or building up too much hype in your own mind about this car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2461#msg2461re: springfield mass [carolinabob]        carolinabob...i have no problem with someone posting an opinion that doesn't go along with what i may think, but when it's something that goes against any and everything that everyone is saying...it's ridiculous.	1
	had he said the ride was too firm for his liking, okay...i can leave it at that.	1
	but to suggest that the suspension is so bad that the car 'bounds' up and down on the highway...come on!!!	1
	i can't knock him on the comment about body roll, but in reality...what is he expecting, it's not a bmw which is the only car that has less body roll and guess what...it's a sports sedan.	1
	not sure what to think on the lack of leather aroma, didn't really know that was a requirement of leather.	1
	concerning the softness and suppleness of the leather...that's subjective, but it sounds to me like he wants down filled seats.	1
	difference in color between dash and other parts of the interior...a lot of cars are doing that now, but if you don't want it...go for the black interior and problem solved.	1
	to be honest, the only thing that's a different color is the carpet...no matter what color interior you get...it comes with black carpet (at least from what i've seen thus far).	1
	he expects vault like solidity in the doors like the german cars have...ummmmmm, er uh...no other car has that same solidity, however...the solidity of the genesis doors is far from lacking.	1
	he may have a slight point on the knobs feeling cheap, but other than that...what other dash bits feel cheap?	1
	he contradicted by saying the leather wrapped dash was nice, which is a good portion of the dash.	1
	okay, we can go on for days and days, but the reality is...this guy is coming from left field.	1
	if he just doesn't like the car, just say that, but don't try and bring up points about the car that contradict any and everything that everybody else is saying about the car.	1
	i mean...in the end, he'll look like a crazy loon when 99.9% of all the other postings pretty much rave about every attribute concerning the genesis that the poster brought up.	1
	hyundai missed the mark of bmw and benz, but...hey, aim high and you don't fall as low if you miss.	1
	just think if they benchmarked the chrysler 300, missing would have meant more like chevy cobalt or ford edge.	1
	to be mentioned with the likes of lexus and infiniti is still huge considering it is a hyundai.	1
	know what i mean?       	1

	i've seen this behavior many times before.	1
	i joined these forums in the fall of '98 - almost 10 years ago -  i noticed long ago that the most heated discussions are about cars that haven't yet hit the showrooms in large numbers.	1
	it's too early for the car mags to publish comparisons using production vehicles, so folks get into arguments that can't be settled - at least not until the manufacturer has shipped enough vehicles so that all interested parties can take test drives.	1

	not sure if you've paid attention, but there are plenty of folks posting their experiences with a test drive of the genesis and some of those postes have experience with the likes that hyundai benchmarked when creating it.	1
	if you take a look around, there have been a few online pubs.	1
	that have test driven and posted results of the genesis already.	1
	which is why i say that everybody except for one single person...has praised the genesis for everything from it's fit  finish, offerings, driving dynamics and basically...being the car it's supposed to be.	1
	sure, the benchmark was bmw/benz...did they hit that mark, no...not exactly.	1
	however, falling short of that means they laned in lexus/infiniti territory which is hardly anything to scoff at considering we are talking about an offering from hyundai.	1
	taking that into mind, do you think that they would get everything on the car exactly right on their first go?	1
	if you can honestly believe they would...you're crazy.	1
	i bet you, dollars to donuts that hyundai follows up with the 2010 model and it'll have the little nit-picky things folks do find fault with.	1
	your hat's off to jeffreid and rightfully so as he has definitely provided a plethora of information to a lot of us concerning this car before it really hit.	1
	however, if you go back and read his post of his opinion about the comparison between the genesis and the benz e-class...well, he is one that feels that hyundai did hit the mark to a degree.	1
	there's a saying...you can't please all the people all the time and i understand that, and this just happens to be a case where you've got one person (so far) that just seems to want to find fault with the car where nobody else can.	1
	go head, go back and look at all the postings about folks that have taken one out for a test drive and you tell me if their feedback comes close to saying what this one guy is saying.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2467#msg2467test drive        i had a little extra time today so i decided to take a look at the genesis.	1
	i went to mccarthy hyundai in olathe, ks.	1
	suburb of kansas city.	1
	i have driven a lexus of some sort for the past 8 years so my dealer expectations are somewhat high.	1
	these folks could not have been nicer and i was impressed by the dealership and the people and their knowledge of the car.	1
	they had 5 genesis cars on hand and they told me up front that none have been sold so far and that all pricing is list msrp.	1
	no discounts and no add ons.	1
	the car i test drove was silver with black interior.	1
	msrp was $36,000.	1
	with a premium pkg.	1
	of some sort.	1
	6 cylinder and 18 inch wheels.	1
	took about a 5 mile loop of side roads and freeway.	1
	i found the genesis to be very, very impressive as it rode and drove extremely well.	1
	brakes were excellent.	1
	no complaints at all.	1
	the car had 124 miles on it and the average mpg was 15.  i have to assume that the first 120 or so miles the car was driven kind of hard because i did not baby it and accelerated up a little over 80 when merging onto the freeway, yet the mpg average went from 14 to over 15 during my short drive.	1
	i found the driving position to be extremely comfortable and the car just seemed to fit like a glove.	1
	i sat in the rear also and it had plenty of room.	1
	i also tried the front passenger seat because i did not like the fact that the passenger seat had only 4 way power and many times it is hard to get comfortable in a seat like this.	1
	no problem with the genesis as the seat had enough tilt to it be be very comfortable.	1
	as much as i liked the car i did not feel that the interior was as nice as say, a lexus ls 430.  the leather was not quite as nice and neither was the center console.	1
	too much hard plastic there.	1
	a little wood grain or leather there would have worked wonders.	1
	i do not think it is unreasonable to compare this car to the ls because you can buy a very nice 2005 lexus ls 430 cpo for about the same price.	1
	i would also like to report that the status of a brand is not important to me but this is not true.	1
	it is important (just call me shallow).	1
	this is going to be the hurdle for the genesis i think.	1
	all that being said, i was simply astounded at the overall quality of this car and at the way it drove.	1
	to my ear it was very quiet and the doors did close with that expensive sounding 'thunk'  it will get my serious attention in about 6 months.	1
	more on the dealer.	1
	from what i have read here i had very low expectations.	1
	all my fears turned out to be unfounded.	1
	they were very courteous and low key and they sent me on my way with a very nice brochure.	1
	they were also quite knowledgeable about the car.	1
	more on comparing to lexus.	1
	i have not owned an es or a gs but last year when our lx was being repainted (courtesy of lexus) we had both of these cars as a loaner for about 3 weeks.	1
	the gs for the first 2 weeks and the es for the last week.	1
	we liked the gs awd.	1
	list price around $50k.	1
	i would take the genesis over the gs hands down.	1
	much bigger and drove better.	1
	the es we did not care for at all.	1
	bloated feeling and very isolated steering.	1
	priced about the same as the genesis.	1
	the genesis blew them both away.	1

	to answer your question...yes, i have driven the genesis and i have posted my impressions of that test drive.	1
	the only thing i've done is question the specific points for greater feedback from the poster and questioned how he could come to form those opinions when they seem so far out of left field.	1
	i can deal with subjective stuff like whether or not you like the grille, the wheels, the overall look of the car.	1
	as well as other subjective stuff like seat  ride comfort...all of which are quite...subjective.	1
	i've had heated debates with other posters before and this isn't even along those lines.	1
	i took his points and challenged them to find out how he possibly arrived at his conclusions...is that so wrong?	1
	i didn't call him out of his name or say he was stupid or anything because he feels the way he feels.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2469#msg2469re: some of you folks... [allmet33]        yes, to answer your question.	1
	he is entitled to his opinion just as you are as entitled to yours.	1
	it's interesting to me that no one is going to forget what he posted if for no other reason that you keep posting about it.	1
	now how about we just move on?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2470#msg2470        the gen seems to be in a similar situation as the mitsu diamante when it first came out and like another poster mentioned, the mazda millenia when it debuted.	1
	as much as i like the gen it does indeed have a bit of a hurdle to join the ranks of lexus/infinity, but i think it's something they can achieve if all goes right.	1
	the cheapness of the center console is pretty glaring and those that have done their lexus/infinity comparos will notice this, as w/ the chrome-insert wheels, just a notch below what a 40k offering should be.	1
	these will be addressed i'm fairly certain w/ the first update.	1
	thye've got a great car on their hands but you've also got to factor assumed depreciation.	1
	hyundai just doesn't get respect at all when it comes to trade-in time, maybe if you're trading for another hyundai they'll be a bit more fair, but our sonata really took a beating when we traded it in.	1
	not being negative, as i really think they've done a great job here.	1
	i wouldn't be too quick to say they're the equal to inf/lex just yet though.	1
	and yes, i've driven one        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2471#msg2471the wife finally drove the genesis        finally got the family together and trotted down to the dealer in southern calif.                we 4 arrived and to our surprise on a beautiful sunday afternoon we were the only lookers.	1
	my wife took the wheel and our two boys were in the back and the salesman was up front (nice guy) i stayed behind and let nature take its demo course as i wanted her to decide with no influence from me.	1
	they were gone for about 30 minutes.	1
	so i spent some time looking at the 4 genesis's on the lot and talked a little with the other sales guy (also nice guy).	1
	i was surprised to learn that hyundai has huge concerns of the success of genesis here in south orange county calif as they believe people here buy things based on image and name.yea, i can see where they would be concerned as most people are always trying to keep up with the jones's.	1
	so i am sitting on the bench outside enjoying the weather and about 30 minutes later in comes the family.	1
	i was still the only customer there.	1
	the wife was quiet and i listened as she shared her impression of the car.	1
	she said the genesis was not as nice of a ride as the gs350 and did not turn as sharp either.	1
	the wood trim was too dark inside and road noise could be heard inside.	1
	i think the biggest issue was the poor selection of interior colors.	1
	she wanted grey and genesis offers nothing even close.	1
	so she took the ride and will most likely go with the gs 350 which appears to be about $46k vs for now $42k.	1
	so as we leave to go to costco and the lot is again empty of potential customers.	1
	i did ask the sales guy to call me when the v8 comes in with everything on it so i can have my lady take a final look and drive.	1
	30-45 days for arrival may be just too long for her.	1
	i have asked her to go back to lexus and take another drive.	1
	well see.	1
	sure hope they add a grey like interior to the v8, if not, our owning a genesis are remote, especially since it will be her car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2472#msg2472only things i like        since some people seem to take personal insult with anyone posting their subjective opinions of things they don't like about the genesis, i will only post things i like, leaving it to readers of inside line with less opinions about negative things they may possibly agree with.	1
	pat, thanks for your sensible comments.	1
	to the others that have defended my right to post both things i liked and didn't like based on my test drive, thank you.	1
	to those who were upset by my review, i don't know what to say to you.	1
	those comments were my honest impressions, whether you share them or not.	1
	i'll even go further, and supplement my list of things i liked, because i left them off (but i won't mention anything negative):                                things i liked:                                 things i already mentioned that i like, but i will repeat:                rwd                nice low end torque from the 6                quiet idle and smooth acceleration                quiet interior at speed                the appearance of hand-stitched leather covering the dash.	1
	nice touch.	1
	good sounding stereo                good amount of standard features                 newly mentioned things i like, but left off my last list until i thought about it more                exterior styling - nicer than any competing mercedes or lexus (especially lexus)                intuitive controls far easier to use than, say, bmw models                very nicely designed and styled gauge cluster                exhaust note                very good factory paint process                controls on steering wheel are like the acura rl; very good                although i drove the v6, i love that hyundai chose a zf 6 speed auto for the v8       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2473#msg2473re: some of you folks... [allmet33]         taking that into mind, do you think that they would get everything on the car exactly right on their first go?	1
	if you can honestly believe they would...you're crazy.	1
	couldn't agree more,  that's why i steer clear of any brand-new design for at least a year.	1

	guess what?	1
	all those 'professional' reviews are written in magazines whose primary source of revenue is car advertisers.	1
	i'll await consumer reports review of the genesis, not that it will change my mind about the ride quality, based on my butt-o-meter.	1
	the butt-o-meter doesn't lie, as far as i'm concerned.	1
	one last thing - i am far from the only one saying the genesis has a too-stiff ride.	1
	go back and review the comments and see for yourself.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2477#msg2477re: [hebrewhammer]        everything is relative.	1
	i think it would be helpful for others if you can compare the quality of the genesis relative to another vehicle.	1
	that helps those who may be familiar with other vehicles but have not driven the genesis get an idea of what you're talking about.	1
	it will also help others understand the degree of subjectivity/preference each reviewer has.	1
	it would also show any bias in the review.	1
	for instance, if you say it's stiffer than a lexus gs, then few would question it.	1
	but if you say it's stiffer than a bmw 5, then i think others have the point of questioning your review.	1
	if you say the fit and finish is not on par with the lexus ls, few would have problems.	1
	but if you say the fit and finish is poor compared to a maxima, then many would strongly disagree.	1
	(note:  i've been in all those cars)                                as for professional review, some are quite useless.	1
	i remember reading a review of the azera.	1
	the reviewer slammed the azera of its poor agility and handling... compared to his corvette!	1
	my point is that if a review doesn't do any comparatives, then it's just stating opinions.	1
	there're nothing wrong with that, btw.	1
	afterall, there's no reference point to challenge the opinions.	1
	readers should take that into account and decide its credibility and whether to ignore it.       	1

	the link supports my thought that the market timing is bad for genesis.	1
	they made a fatal error in not bringing in the 3.3 for under $30,000 as promised along with lying about having adaptive cruise control available.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2482#msg2482re: hang in there and watch the price drop.	1
	[jeansyc]        i disagree.	1
	the sub-30k tag has already been reserved for the azera, the genesis has the right pricing structure.	1
	sure, most would like the price to be even lower, but from hyundai's perspective, this clearly makes the distinction with no overlapping.	1
	the genesis is the natural progression to the azera, just like the rest of hyundai's fleet.	1
	as for the 3.3l engine, i am not sure how the ommission is a fatal error - sure, you may get 0.5 mpg (combined) better than the 3.8, but mpg for the genesis is one of its many strong points (v6  v8).	1
	and, adaptive crusise control, cost may have played a factor here.	1
	i wouldn't say, however, hyundai is lying, as the automaker reserves the right to make adjustments to pricing, equipment, and others as they see fit.	1
	yes, hyundai once said the price of the base form would be under 30k, which likely would have been with the 3.3l, but even if that engine had existed for the north american market, the cost of materials and everything else, would not have supported the pricing.	1
	no one, including hyundai, had expected cost of pretty everything to risen at a such fast rate.	1
	and, what has every automaker done in response?	1
	price increases.	1
	by the way, last i checked, hyundai is still in the business to make a profit, so be happy how cheap autos are here in the us market, especially, compared to other markets of the world.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2483#msg2483re: hang in there and watch the price drop.	1
	[joe97]        i think the biggest obstacle for the genesis is trying to be a premium luxury vehicle amidst a more utilitarian brand line.	1
	the main reason lexus, infinity, and acura broke away from their parent companies was to pursue the upper-crust market and differentiate their brands from their parent companies w/ nicer showrooms, salesman that were dedicated to the smaller line of performance/luxury cars, and of course pricing that was also at a premium.	1
	for hyundai to tread in these waters and still keep their main vehicle lineup (the elantra/sonata/santefe, etc.)	1
	but also include the luxury lineup of the gen  gen coupe may be a bit of a tightrope.	1
	it is a bit vain to think that the brand really matters, but for the gen to truly compete w/ the lux brands it may need to further remove itself from the hyundai branding.	1
	i've heard several accounts of hyundai going into a separate lux brand and this may just be the beginning.	1
	as it stands the gen is more easily compared to a loaded rear-drive avalon (since the avalon is atop the toyota line but is somewhat compareable to the es 350).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2484#msg2484re: hang in there and watch the price drop.	1
	[blnewto]        i'd agree with your take on the current position of hyundai.	1
	if i recall correctly, i believe hyundai has said for the us market, and north america (na) as a whole, the cost of setting up a luxury brand was too costly, with the return of the initial investment (break-even) estimated at a very long time (don't remember the exact number of the years).	1
	that said, hyundai is contending with the luxury brand elsewhere, such as in its home market and china.	1
	i am sure hyundai has been studying the na market, and will continue to assess the possibility of a luxury nameplate.	1
	as we stand now, and if nothing else, i'd say the arrival of the genesis line will provide intangible benefits to the rest of the hyundai fleet and equally important, the brand itself.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2485#msg2485re: hang in there and watch the price drop.	1
	[joe97]        joe97...you are correct.	1
	creating a luxury brand would have set the company back big time and that's an even bigger chance to take as opposed to bringing the genesis to market under the hyundai moniker.	1
	the genesis can serve two purposes here, bring much credibility and respectability to the brand and also set a standard that a company doesn't have to branch off in order to accomodate various walks of life by offering everything from the econo-box commuter car all the way up to full size luxury sedans.	1
	the only thing they are missing in their fleet is a luxo full-sized suv (veracruz is close) and a pick-up truck.	1
	wow...all from one car maker.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2486#msg2486re: hang in there and watch the price drop.	1
	[jeansyc]        adaptive cruise should be available next year.	1
	i don't think it was entirely a cost issue.	1
	hma is obsessed with being as close to 'zero defects' as possible.	1
	if they feel that a part or a system needs work , then they will simply delay it until they feel it is right.	1
	for example.	1
	notice that there are no white genesi right now.	1
	hma is assuring themselves of their paint line on this car before they roll out the most difficult paint job.	1
	they want to be certain that it is as close to perfect as possible before they hit the ground.	1
	they are paying for putting themselves in the 'unreliable' category.	1
	that may not be entirely accurate anymore, but perception is much more important than reality.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2487#msg2487        it would make sense (at least to this layman)  for hyundai to combine w/ kia, scrap the kia brand and focus it's effort on the core hyundai products and also open a genesis luxury division.	1
	this would accomplish quite a bit imo.	1
	kia and hyundai take sales away from each other, kia isn't gaining market share and has a brand perception that is quite poor (compared to hyundai).	1
	hyundai is gaining market share and is continually improving its' product line, i think it now competes well w/ honda/toyota/nissan.	1
	making a new luxury division w/ the money it saves by ditching kia and starting w/ the genesis/azera(rebadged  updated)/veracrus(also rebadged  updated),which are all very nice examples of their class, would be a good way to separate from hyundai and get the demographic it desires into their showrooms and make it easier for someone to make a decision to plunk down 30-40k.	1
	currently no matter how much you love hyundai it's still considered a utilitarian brand, and i doubt it will every rise above that.	1
	that's not at all bashing hyundai, it's just the fickle american mindset (and that of the general automotive press).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2488#msg2488re:  [blnewto]        i disagree with the removal of the kia brand.	1
	believe it or not, hyundai and kia products are much more differentiated than many might think; aside from accent/rio (with an exception, accent has the 3 door; rio has the 5), tucson/sportage, entourage/sedona, everything else is vast different.	1
	kia and hyundai take sales away from each other, kia isn't gaining market share and has a brand perception that is quite poor (compared to hyundai).	1
	hyundai is gaining market share and is continually improving its' product line, i think it now competes well w/ honda/toyota/nissan.	1
	both are actually gaining market share, if i recall correctly.	1
	as a matter of fact, kia has been performing better than hyundai in recent times, believe it or not.	1
	and both are exceeding the industry average so far in 2008, which has been just down right scary.	1
	making a new luxury division w/ the money it saves by ditching kia                                it's not as easy as 1-2-3.  there is no guarantee the luxury division would work, especially given the competitiveness of the market, timing of the market, loyalty that exists in the luxury market, not to mention, zero brand equity.	1
	this is in addition to hyundai's assessment the benefit wouldn't absorb cost until a long time after the initial investment.	1
	on the other side of things, i would like to think kia as a brand like scion, with more appeal to the younger generation crowd - the upcoming soul, forte, koup are good examples.	1
	i like the direction where kia is heading.	1
	bottom line, kia isn't going anywhere, and the luxury division is nowhere near.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2489#msg2489re: springfield mass [louiswei]        right.	1
	i don't give much credit to auto 'professionals' too.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2491#msg2491re:  [blnewto]        i thought the same as you-put kia to death and launch a new luxo brand.	1
	but hyundai-kia motors group must be thinking differently.	1
	as you know, kia hired a big-shot car designer peter schreyer once in vw and audi wishing him to bring a totally new brand personality to kia.	1
	and soul is his first move.	1
	forte and production version of koup will follow it soon.	1
	i don't think it's easy for kia to refresh its brand perception by that new design direction in the short run.	1
	but, anyway, hyundai-kia planned and is carrying out the plan now.	1
	i guess h-k motors group may try to position kia as a division like scion of toyota which has more unique, dynamic and fun-car-like line-up rather than hyundai.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2493#msg2493re:  [allthatblue]        rumor has it that the direction kia is going to take is to compete directly with the likes of chevy  saturn while hyundai continues to go against toyota, honda and now lexus  infiniti.	1
	i guess like how gm has blue-collar chevy (kia) and then slightly upscaled gmc (hyundai).	1
	it makes more sense now that i understand with the upcoming genesis coupe, that the tiburon will be edited from the line-up, but...kia will be picking up the slack by producing koup.	1
	it's not to say that hyundai can't eventually branch off a luxury brand, but right now...the genesis can truly cement hyundai's bid to be the serious contender they've shown to become.	1
	who knows...maybe, just maybe...hyundai will turn into the luxury line (competing with lexus, infiniti, acura, volvo...) while kia takes on toyota, honda, nissan, chevy, ford...).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2494#msg2494my test drive....        ok... so after months of reading about the genesis, i finally got some time behind the wheel.	1
	my gf was picking up her elantra from the hyundai body shop and since we were there i started talking to her salesman and i asked to drive one.	1
	i explained that i still had about 7 - 8 months before my current lease was up, but was really interested in the car.	1
	was very professional the whole time and never tried to pressure me or anything.	1
	they had 3 models right up front that i could see.	1
	one was a base at 33k, the other a tech at 40k.	1
	didn't look at the other one as it was the same burgundy color as the one in the showroom.	1
	i drove the tech equipped black on black.	1
	first thing i noticed was the quality of the interior.	1
	very nice fit and finish and the leather was great.	1
	i hate black interior but that is just me.	1
	i much preferred the other model with the beige.	1
	the car had around 350 miles on it and the salesman stated this is the model they are using for test drives.	1
	after a brief intro to some features and a few minutes looking for the sunshade button we were off.	1
	this dealership has a test track which isn't the best imo but for an initial drive is fine.	1
	i have to say that overall i am very impressed.	1
	very quiet, great direct (although, light) steering and nice firm brake pedal.	1
	i did one lap very sedate and the next couple were progressively faster as i got used to the car.	1
	there was little or no body roll though the curves and the car felt like it wanted me to give it more.	1
	the ride was firm but not harsh.	1
	i believe it may be a bit softer with 17' rims which i prefer anyway.	1
	my '06 avalon would have taken the curves at the same speed but would have been squeeling the tires to say the least.	1
	none of that in the genesis.	1
	as for the engine it was quiet, but... the 2gr  in my avalon is more willing to rev and i think on the dragstrip my avalon would be a touch quicker.	1
	seat of the pants observation here, and the genesis was not broken it yet so that could change a little.	1
	seat comfort was great, however, i wished for a bit more front legroom and overall my avalon is roomier inside, but it wouldn't deter me from buying the car.	1
	the stereo was great, and the controls seemed logical.	1

	overall a great car.	1
	i would need a much longer test drive on everyday roads but it is most definately a contender to replace my avalon.	1
	from your comments, you seem to be confirming what someone said about a dozen pages back or so - that the real cross-shopping for the genesis will be among avalon owners and so on, even though the genesis is rwd and the avalon is fwd.	1
	also, you confirmed my test drive experience in two respects.	1
	i said the ride was too firm for a luxury car, and that the steering wheel was numb and light.	1
	everyone jumped all over me for it.	1
	you suggest the avalon motor is superb, and i agree.	1
	the avalon is really a stealth lexus in terms of quietness, ride smoothness, interior fit and finish, reliability and interior roominess.	1
	and if you and i are right, hyundai's problem may not be that the competition they benchmarked is 5k to 15k more, but that new avalons are being discounted to around 26k or 27k now, which would be 6k to 14k cheaper than the genesis, assuming that hyundai doesn't heavily discount the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2496#msg2496re: my test drive.... [hebrewhammer]        to take the debate another direction...if the ride is too firm to be a luxury car and quite a few folks have stated the ride to be comparable to that of the infiniti m or the lexus gs sedans...are those too harsh riding to be luxury sedans as well?	1
	i honestlyl believe the genesis will garner looks from those shopping everything from the avalon/maxima all the way up to the m35/45 and benz e-class.	1
	i say those because there will be a lot of folks that want the luxury offerings, but don't want to pay for premium fuel and the genesis foots that bill.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2497#msg2497genesis prices        i have attended the hyundai launch of the genesis and i can tell you that there are only going to be 8000 make for the us this year.	1
	if you do the math, there are just over 600 dealers in the us, that means that every deaelr will get about 12 of them .	1
	the v8 will list for about 44 all loaded up.	1
	i have a 40000 one on my lot right now and its the 3.8 with premium and tech pack.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2498#msg2498re: my test drive.... [hebrewhammer]         i said the ride was too firm for a luxury car                                i don't think it was any firmer than a m35 and or even a maxima.	1
	firmer than my avalon.... definately.	1
	it all depends what you are looking for.	1
	i wouldn't object to something a little firmer than my avalon but i don't want something bone jarring.	1
	the genesis fits into this category.	1
	and that the steering wheel was numb and light                                i wouldn't call it numb, but it was lighter than i had anticipated.	1
	i think the term i used was 'direct' which it was.	1
	that the real cross-shopping for the genesis will be among avalon owners and so on                                i have said that from day one... even on other boards.	1
	the dealer said he has had people in avalons and buicks but has also had people driving mbs and bimmers driving the genesis as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2499#msg2499re: my test drive.... [tjc78]        right, i agree.	1
	the v6 is firm, and the v8 is firmer according to reports.	1
	i predict that the genesis will not do well, partly due to pricing, and partly due to the timing of the rollout (something they couldn't control).	1
	has anyone seen the insane discounts going on with almost all cars and trucks right now?	1
	it's crazy.	1
	i'd venture to bet not many people will want to spend 10k more on a genesis than comparably equipped avalon.	1
	the only exception are the uber-mpg compacts and subcompacts.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2500#msg2500re: my test drive.... [hebrewhammer]         i'd venture to bet not many people will want to spend 10k more on a genesis than comparably equipped avalon                                how is that even possible?	1
	a fully decked out avalon is about 38 - 39k.	1
	a fully loaded v6 genesis is 40k.	1
	you mean to tell me you are going to get a brand new av limited for 30k?	1
	tell me where so i can buy now.	1
	that is considering that the genesis will go at sticker.	1
	it won't, the dealer last night was willing to deal if i was.	1
	no adm or any add-ons either.	1
	as much as i like my avalon, lets be fair here... a 27 or 28k avalon xl is not in the same equipment class as even a base  genesis.	1
	even if you compare an avalon xls which i own at about 34 - 35k the genesis with premium package                35k is better equipped for about the same $$.	1
	can the avalon be had for less otd?	1
	probably, but in all fairness the avalon is nearly a 4 year old design now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2501#msg2501re: my test drive.... [tjc78]        no, no, no...he meant a used avalon...you can get a used '07 xls for about $10k less than a genesis 3.8 w/premium package.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2502#msg2502re: my test drive.... [hebrewhammer]        wow, first you post a review that refutes what virtually everyone else has written about the genesis, then you completely misrepresent what another poster stated about his test drive to make them fall in line with your views.	1
	you top all that off by just lying about the relative price difference between an avalon and a genesis.	1
	i get that you don't like the genesis, but if you have to make stuff up to support your views then maybe you should reexamine them, or your reasons behind them.	1
	i find your posts to be extremely misleading and disingenuous and ask you here and now to cease with the misstatements and unsubstantiated claims.	1
	your opinions are as valid as anyone else's and are more than welcome, just stop making things up to support them.	1
	for the record, i do not work for, nor even own a hyundai, and this is not an emotional response to your posts, only an attempt to have an air of honesty and fairness in this forum.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2505#msg2505re: my test drive.... [hebrewhammer]        hebrewhammer:  putting it in context and compare the genesis to the avalon, then your comment regarding the firmness of the genesis makes sense and is very credible.	1
	the avalon and camry are known for soft rides.	1
	however, driving them [moderately] fast over a dip or a hump on the curved road and you'll quickly discover that the sponginess of those cars are not a positive attribute to have.	1
	that's where you'd want the car to grip the road instead of sending you flying off in a tangent.	1
	but if you're a fan of the avalon and camry softness, you'd naturally dislike the genesis.	1
	it's all a matter of personal preference.	1
	as for the quietness, ride smoothness, and fit and finish, the genesis is as good as lexus ls430.	1
	(keep in mind i'm not comparing the quality of the materials here.	1
	of course, ls is better)  i haven't driven in the ls460 yet, so i don't know about it.       	1

	going back to the earlier post he specifically mentioned 'new'.	1
	he is right you can easily get a 'new' avalon (a xl model) for 28k.	1
	however, it is not equipped like the base genesis and not even close to a tech package.... naturally it will be a lot less $$       	1

	i think the genesis has a good shot of being sucessful.	1
	it's a good car, and once consumers get the message (hyundai usa has to do a good job at communication the message - full advertising should be around the corner), this car will present as an alternative to both the price set (those with similar pricing) and the image set (competitors at 10k or more).	1
	in terms of a number, i would say 1-2k initially after sufficient supply would be a good target to shoot for.       	1

	stand by my comments.	1
	interesting that no one can criticize the car, but you can criticize us for criticizing the car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2518#msg2518re:  [docrw]         see what i mean                                yep..  the fact of matter here is that if you are going to compare the avalon to the genesis do it on level playing field.	1
	as i mentioned i own an '06 av xls that is an absolutely fantastic vehicle.	1
	after driving the genesis i can honestly say that they are very close.	1
	if the most room and soft ride is your preference go for the avalon if you want something a little more capable in the handling dept and like rwd go for the genesis.	1
	like i mentioned earlier i do prefer the response from the 3.5 in my avalon compared to the 3.8 in the gen... but i suspect many people couldn't even tell the difference.	1
	as for pricing they are very similar.... sure the base avalon can be had for less then a base gen but the equipment levels aren't even close.	1
	the  base avalon has cloth interior... apples to apples please!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2519#msg2519re:  [docrw]        i will have to keep that in mind for future reference.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2522#msg2522re: springfield mass [depreciation]        i'll say it once more.	1
	its not the criticism that i mind, its the criticisms that are unsubstantiated or without any frame of reference.	1
	if someone comes on here and says i drove the car and it doesn't measure up to my bmw, mb, lexus, toyota etc., as far as... goes, that's fine.	1
	to just come out and say the ride is too firm and it bounds on the highway, without saying in comparison to what, or at what speed under what conditions is not helpful to anyone.	1
	to then make things up about pricing or twisting someone else's words completely undermines one's credibility.	1
	listen, everyone is free to post what they want as long as it is not personally offensive.	1
	however, i think it is not beneficial to this forum or any other, to let remarks like i referenced above go unanswered.	1
	i never made any personal comments, i kept them geared toward the content of the post itself which i feel is completely appropriate.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2523#msg2523re: [hebrewhammer]        consumer reports gave a glowing review to the azera, particularly the ride.	1
	now they say the 2007 is a used car to avoid.	1
	unfortunately, the suspension problems in the azera did not surface until about the 5,000 mile mark of ownership.	1
	hyundai admited it by replacing the struts and a new suspension for the 2009.                i wish i had known about the bouncing/wallowing/porpoising azera before i bought it.	1
	test drove four for up to one hour each on different roads, but since new, none had the problems yet.	1
	thanks for your post as it is what i want to hear so i can make a better judgement on the genesis.	1
	btw, i got massacared on the azera site for criticizing the suspension, even though it is the most discussed topic.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2524#msg2524re:  [tjc78]        hold up a minute...if mentioning room between the avalon and genesis...the avalon is spec'd at 106.9 cu.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2526#msg2526re: [carolinabob]        hey bob, i was one that was skeptical about the suspension problem until someone pointed out the fact that i haven't experienced what most others are because of my earlier production '06 (build date of 11/05) which probably has different shocks than the ones the tsb covers.	1
	that being said...it would seem like an issue that all who have that problem need to start complaining en masse to hyundai about it to do something more of a permanent fix.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2527#msg2527re:  [carolinabob]        welllllllll....the azera is still going head to head with the avalon, but with the genesis being the shiny new toy in the toy box...it's getting all the attention.	1
	i think the avalon really gets thrown in simply by price point.	1
	it's obvious that you will get more car with the genesis.	1
	from a performance standard...i really don't think the avalon will keep up with the genesis (imo).       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2529#msg2529re:  [allmet33]        you are right about the trunk... however, not sure how the genesis comes up with more interior space, because in the avalon i do not sit with my seat all the way back and have plenty of room to extend my legs out.	1
	in the genesis the seat was all the way back and my leg was slightly bent.	1
	with the seat in that position my legs just touched the seatback when sitting in the rear.	1
	in my avalon there is a good inch of room to the seatback.	1

	in my azera, with the driver's seat set up for me to drive, i can sit behind it but i have to open my legs so that my knees are on each side of the seat back.	1
	in the genesis, setting the driver's seat up for me to drive...climbing behind it my knees don't even come close to the seat back.	1
	try setting both as you would for driving, then see.	1
	you stated that you don't sit with the seat all the way back and you have an inch of space between the seat back and your knees.	1
	then you said in the genesis with the seat all the way back...your leg was slightly bent.	1
	why would you put the seat all the way back on the genesis, but not in the avalon?	1
	the avalon, i set the driver's seat up for me to drive and got behind it and my knees were slightly apart and touching the seat back.	1
	you end up with more room in the avalon because the rear seats recline a bit as well.	1
	the numbers i came up with are from the respective car maker sites.	1
	if you compare the specs...the genesis has more front leg room and the avalon shows to have more rear leg room.	1
	some of it may be up, but the head room is only an inch higher in the genesis.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2532#msg2532re:  [carolinabob]        rear-wheel aside, there will be cross-shopping between the avalon (upper trims ie limited) and the genesis, simply the price is in about the same range - see tjc78 very good comparisons earlier!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2533#msg2533        am much as i like the genesis i still think it's tough for hyundai to pull off the 'everything for everybody' vehicle line.	1
	the veracruz is so much more refined than the santafe as is the azera compared to sonata, but both those 'premium' vehicles have anemic sales numbers.	1
	i have yet to see a car manufacturer able to make the jump to luxury/performance vehicles and keep them in the same company.	1
	the diamante was initally comparable to the acura legend  the small lexus but never mustered enough sales to continue it's climb.	1
	similar was the mazda millenia, and just recently the volkswagen phaeton.	1
	when folks want to move up to a premium vehicle they also want that premium nameplate (as pathetic as that may seem).	1
	when you enter the higher price range do you really want to be driving a mazda, mitsubishi, or volkswagen (just giving the previous examples)?	1
	these cars (especially the vw) may very well be great cars but at the end of the day they're utilitarian brands amongst rival luxury/performance nameplates.	1
	i'm sure the best seiko watch is every bit as good as the cheapest rolex, but what would 95% of the  folks shelling out 1k want on their wrist?	1
	i am rooting for hyundai in this one, it's just gonna be a tough road imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2534#msg2534re:  [tjc78]        hmmmmmmmmmmmm....it could be awfully close.	1
	i mean...the azera is only .6 of a second behind the avalon with the 3.8 producing 263 hp.	1
	the genesis weighs in less than 200 lbs.	1
	heavier than the azera and has almost 30 more hp, a better transmission and it's rwd.	1
	not sure, but i think it would make for a pretty good match up to be honest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2535#msg2535re:  [allmet33]         the numbers i came up with are from the respective car maker sites.	1
	i would love to know how they measure sometimes.	1
	all i can say is that my avalon felt roomier and i was really surprised that when i got back into my car that i had another inch of seat travel.	1
	nevertheless they are close enough that it shouldn't be a factor if deciding between the two.	1
	what is nice about the avalon is the reclining rear seats and the flat rear floor.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2536#msg2536re:  [allmet33]         hmmmmmmmmmmmm....it could be awfully close                                believe me i am sure it would be.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2543#msg2543re:  [caraddict2]        well, there is not a definitive answer that fits everyone.	1
	for me, a rear-wheel drive offers superior driving dynamics than those of front-wheel drive models.	1
	the azera is built as an entry premium cruiser (similar to others in the class ie avalon), with the tuning of a softer ride; on the other thand, the genesis has a firmer setup, a balanced one, ready for vast twist and turns, and all without much body roll.	1
	ultimately, a rwd is hands down the better choice for me over fwd models so to answer your question, yes.       	1

	the selection out there is amazing in this price group.	1
	i drove a tech package genesis and was told i could have it for $41,500 plus tax, tag and title (msrp 40,000).	1
	went to an acura dealer and drove a 2008 rl with tech package, was offered for $43,750 plus tax, tag and title (msrp 50,615).	1
	the m35 with tech package offered at $45,500 plus tax, tag and title (msrp 48,065).	1
	also found a 528i with nav (msrp 47,425) for $45,800 plus tax, tag and title.	1
	a mb e350 with premium i pack (msrp 56,???)	1
	for $48,500.	1
	tomorrow, i will test drive a lexus gs 350 with nav that lists around 48k and am told by phone that i can get at least 5k off.	1
	going to check out the mks and cts also.	1
	the genesis is the cheapest of the group, but the only one going for a premium over msrp while everyone else is going for a substantial discount.	1
	by the time the v8 arrives, the discounts might even be steeper.	1
	i loved the genesis 3.8 tech i test drove today and would have bought it on the spot if i could get it for around 36k or even 37k.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2548#msg2548re:  [caraddict2]        i for one can answer that question.	1
	i have a 2006 azera w/premium package (so i don't have rain sensing wipers, power fold mirrors and a few other things).	1
	i have test driven the genesis w/premium plus package and was very impressed.	1
	however, you say the 2008 azera can be had for just under $25k, but what about the 2009 azera?	1
	there was a posting saying the sticker on one with the ultimate package was just over $30k, with rebates and such...probably get it for about $28k.	1
	anyway, back to the comparo.	1
	in my opinion...the genesis is that much better than the azera.	1
	better materials inside the cabin, better driving dynamic, better ride comfort, better handling, more power without sacrificing fe, and more room.	1
	yeah...i would pay the $36k to get the genesis 3.8 with the premium plus package as opposed to $28k for an '09 azera with the ultimate package.	1
	honestly though...i think i would hold off and get the 4.6 w/tech package for $42 (maybe under $40 by the time i'm ready to make a move.	1

	that way, if they need to adjust prices, it's not as big a hit.	1
	the fact that it's a low volume car will actually buffer whatever price adjustments they may have to make.	1
	competition is a good thing, and this should start the process of getting lexus, infiniti and maybe mercedes and bmw to become more realistic about their prices.	1

	for the hundreds of thousands of folks that buy those cars every year - the prices are quite realistic and those mfgrs.	1
	know (quite well) what those cars are worth every time they sell one.	1
	it is those folks that would even put the name hyundai in the same sentence as those other brands, that would likely never understand what those particular products are really worth and would certainly not pay the extra $ for.	1
	whether or not there are any substantial  differences, or even if those differences 'justify' the higher prices                 in anybody's opinion                is not the point.	1
	my guess is that the genesis is doomed simply because of where you have to go to buy one, a really poor economic climate right now, and a price that is too cheap.	1
	to justify excuse any car's 'failure' by simply saying it is intended on being 'low volume' is a cop-out of sorts.	1
	i assure you that hyundai would be quite happy to have to deal with a car that they can't make enough of - and if that was the case - increase production to do it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2558#msg2558         'my guess is that the genesis is doomed'                                so many have 'guessed' doom on hyundai over the years: the 10 year warranty, the purchase of kia (hyundai/kia sales up a combined 17% last month in a seriously depressed market), the recent near luxury offerings (veracruz, azera) which give hyundai only a slight price advantage over their competitors, but offer serious value and are receiving legitimate acclaim by owners and press (i won't even go into the recent sonata--which is argueably the new sleeper of the mid-size category and every bit as good as an accord and better than a camry).	1
	and yet hyundai continues to legitimize every single offering by incrementally advancing market share and leap-frogging competitors (overtaking honda this year for 5th place worldwide).	1
	now i know that they aren't selling a ton of veracruz's and azera's, but they are increasing sales and entering new segments while enhancing their brand image.	1
	the genesis is their foray into the luxury segment and their business decision to forego the separate brand was to save a billion plus dollars while probably selling more sonata's and elantra's.	1
	doomed?	1
	the best predictor of future performance is past performance and 'doomed' isn't quite what i'd predict.	1
	(kindly refrain from raising the issue of the xg350.	1
	the genesis is a $400 million new platform, rwd, legitimate driving dynamics, etc.	1
	also avoid any mention of the name 'phaeton', as the avg.	1
	genesis will never sell beyond $40k and hyundai knows this.)	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2559#msg2559re: low volume [captain2]        let's at least wait until a sufficient amount of time has passed and then assess how the market is responding to the genesis.	1
	saying this car is doomed, or this car will sweep the nation is premature at this point.	1
	as for the 'low volume' comment, i think the original poster you responded to meant for only for this year and the us market, which it is very much a partial year.	1
	to be fair, the genesis is on the low end in terms of volume is concerned, as are most other mid-to-large luxury sedans (avg.	1
	anywhere between 1-3k units/month).	1
	a price that is too cheap                                                please tell that to some of the posters here - they thought the genesis was too expensive        	1

	i believe the $399 lease special will continue.	1
	hyundai will be able to do this b/c the predicted residual (from alg) value is estimated at 66% after three years, and 50% after two years, in top crop in terms of rankings go.	1
	as for deflation of prices, i will believe it when i see it, especially for european makers like vw (wake me up when passat  jetta come down to the same level as competitors).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2568#msg2568re: the struggles hyundai continues to face... [coachwork]        coachwork...                                there's a couple ways you can look at it.	1
	if you were presented a fully loaded v-8 model and removed the badging and nobody knew the car was made by hyundai and someone were to ask you how much do you think the car is worth...you would probably put it in the $50k range.	1
	however, knowing it's a hyundai makes you question if it's even worth $33k (for the base model).	1
	the real question is do you think the base model is worth $33k?	1
	go out here and take a look around at other offerings for the same amount and see what you get in that car...compare everything.	1
	i say this because you'll get a bunch of answers ranging from 'heck no!'	1
	to 'it's worth more.'	1
	the reality of it is...what do you think?	1
	i for one...think the base model is worth the $33k, but i think the value is either going to be in the 3.8 w/premium plus package ($36k) or the 4.6 w/tech package ($42k).	1
	however, that's just my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2569#msg2569re: low volume [mn778]        there was a lot of speculation before the genesis hit the ground that there wouldn't be any people that are german car owners that would even step foot into a hyundai showroom.	1
	i am very excited to see that there are a number of bmw, m-b, and audi owners here that have taken an interest in the genesis.	1
	i think that this fact speaks volumes as to the appeal that this car has, as well as to the strides in reputation that hyundai has made in the last 5-10 years.	1
	i think that it is also very encouraging that the audi and bmw owners have been as impressed as they have been with the quality of the genesis.	1
	these people should have a pretty good idea as to what constitutes a well made automobile, and as such, are a good frame of reference for a new model.	1
	on a seperate note, i found out this week that every dealer in arkansas that has a genesis on the ground has a markup of at least $2k on them!!	1
	i guess i should have expected this, but i was still a little shocked.	1
	i can't wait for my first speech about how msrp on my car is                 cheaper                than my competition!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2570#msg2570re: the struggles hyundai continues to face... [coachwork]        well, as to the $33000 question, here is another point of view.	1
	a car is just a car.	1
	in the end there is nothing to be had other than getting you from point a to point b. however, what takes us from the $10k accent with no air or radio to the $400k maybach is how we want to get there.	1
	what kind of comfort and style do we feel during the journey.	1
	if a person is just looking for transportation, then heck no, the genesis isn't worth $33k, and no other car is either.	1
	you need to get a scooter.	1
	or a bus pass.	1
	but if you want to ride in a bit of style and a wealth of comfort, then it will cost more than the basics.	1
	just like bacon and cheese cost more on a hamburger.	1
	if you factor in the amount of creature comfort, style, and luxury that the genesis brings in comparison to other offerings on the market, then i think the case is pretty easy to make for the new hyundai flagship.	1
	by the way, i totally agree with the last poster that the base genesis really isn't the best deal.	1
	some of the packages offer much better bang for your buck.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2571#msg2571re: the struggles hyundai continues to face... [jeffreid]        jeffreid...very well put.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2572#msg2572re: the struggles hyundai continues to face... [jeffreid]        there are two kinds of drivers.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2573#msg2573re: the struggles hyundai continues to face... [mn778]        you've been watchin those cadillac commercials again!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2574#msg2574my new genesis        i've put about 300 miles on my new 3.8l premium pkg.	1

	i chose the 17' wheels to get the slightly higher sidewall aspect; the premium plus model we test drove rode a bit firmer than mine and the poor road quality around here is just not conducive to low profile tires.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2575#msg2575re:  [prosource1]        i didn't say anything about hyundai being 'doomed' - only the genesis.	1
	still don't believe that the car buyer is quite ready to accept a $40k+ hyundai and further that they (and pretty much anybody else) is going to have any luck selling large cars right now.	1
	heck, i think one of the reasons for the azeras sales has to be that the car buyer isn't ready for a $30k hyundai either.	1
	i think you'll find btw that the korean market share gains come almost entirely at the expense of the former big 3 - and not necessarily folks like honda and toyota who are reporting record breaking profits.not that hyundai doesn't deserve a lot of that gain - they have a product line that any of those 'detroit' companies should be willing to kill for.	1
	if hyundai is forced to sell a v8 genesis for under $40k as you suggest, this would not be a good thing imo - i thought the idea behind the whole car was to correct a rather sullied reputation - not to continue that reputation as a car that is prone to big discounts and therefore questionable resale values.if the genesis really is going to be a viable competitor to the japanese and german sedans they are  targeting, then they also need to sell it like one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2576#msg2576re: low volume [joe97]         please tell that to some of the posters here - they thought the genesis was too expensive                thank you - because how in the world can anybody think the car is too expensive???	1
	objectively.	1
	for what the car actually is, it plainly isn't too expensive.	1
	unless, of course, it is those people out there that can't get a grip on a 'premium' car that happens to be called a hyundai.	1
	a lexus gs/ls, an infiniti m, and the german 5s, 7s, as, es and ss all cost substantially more, sell at real world prices that are at least related to msrp, have solid resale values and are still not be considered to be expensive for those folks that want cars of those capabilities.	1
	but hyundai can't?	1
	even if the car itself qualifies?	1
	hopefully they can  - but their timing is about as bad as it gets.       	1

	tell me which dealer you bought the car from?	1
	i stay in detroit and only one dealer has agreed to sell the car at sticker or honor the lease deal offered by huyndai.	1
	even then, he is probably looking at larger down payment on the lease.	1
	if i can get the quote from your dealer that would be nice.	1
	i am too looking at only premium package.	1
	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2578#msg2578re: low volume [captain2]        'sell at real world prices that are at least related to msrp'                                not sure what you meant by that.	1
	can you please clarify that?	1
	thanks captain2!	1
	my observation is that most vehicles in the 40 to 50 thousand dollar range have real world prices significantly below their msrp.	1
	they also have some great lease programs that are subsidized.	1
	why should hyundai be any different after the genesis becomes available in larger numbers.	1
	i was leaning towards getting a genesis with the tech package.	1
	i went to lease one today, and the dealer says that the lease program is no longer available.	1
	might wait a few days and look at what lease programs the competition comes up with in august.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2579#msg2579re: [carolinabob]        what's kdm version?	1
	the answer  is it's actually the same genesis as those sold in the state.	1
	while us version of the genesis got some tunning on the suspenstion, both version shared exactly the same mechanical structure on the suspensions(the tunning, in fact, is that the coils(springs) on the suspensions of us version is 'reinforced' by 31% on the front and 13% on the rear compared to kdm version to be more stiff and rigid.	1
	thus if kdm version has got no trouble on the suspensions so far, it's highly probable that us version will be flawless.	1
	it's a simple analogy.	1
	that's all.	1
	ps: the suspension issue is totally mechanical thing, right?	1
	so remove some subjectivity there like 'expectations' because the suspensions of the genesis is meeting the expectations of many of thow who drive it as what it is now.	1
	and drivers, roads, climate in korea are undoubtedly as diverse as any other country's.	1
	20,000+ genesis' and the same number of unique and diverse drivers have been  there.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2580#msg2580re: low volume [goodmove]         can you please clarify that                ?	1
	simple - hyundai vehicles are expected to sell for higher discounts, with more incentives and with better warranties than many of those cars they are competitive with.	1
	i would suggest you wait for your genesis if you can, a purchase price (or a lease cost) has nowhere to go but down.	1
	this would be true of almost any really new vehicle, honeymoons only last so long.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2581#msg2581re: low volume [captain2]        captain...you are right, after the feeding frenzy is over, the prices will drop due to a variety of reasons.	1
	which, when all is said and done...you might be able to get a base genesis for around $30k (if not below) and a fully loaded 4.6 for under $40k.	1
	i said this before and i still believe it to be true.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2582#msg2582re: low volume [allmet33]        yep think there is still a 'feeding' frenzy over at pontiac - see a few g8 gts on the road - a genuinely ugly car (are all pontiacs ugly?)	1
	imo if i ever saw one!	1
	another car you would think would end up getting discounted heavily.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2584#msg2584re: low volume [allmet33]        i just got done with our monthly hyundai regional conference call and i heard a couple of interesting things.	1
	the first thing was the regional g.m.	1
	asking dealers to remove the price adjustments from the genesis.	1
	not that he has any authority to demand it, but it was interesting that it was mentioned in the forum that it was.	1
	second, honda and toyota were both down in the month of july.	1
	toyota by 11% and honda at 2%.	1
	hyundai was down 6%.	1
	i think this is interesting in that honda and hyundai both took some share from toyota.	1
	i think that is a good sign for the brand overall.	1
	that in turn will make resale values better in the years to come.	1
	one last thought.	1
	i posted msrp and invoice data on the genesis some weeks ago.	1
	now, even with the genesis being produced at a low level, if there is a buildup of the cars on several lots, then one should be able to negotiate a pretty good price.	1
	allmet's pricing ideas are pretty realistic, and i think that one could probably make those deals in the near future if the genesis doesn't bust out of the gates.	1
	print off the msrp, invoice, and tmv values on the genesis that you want and ask the salesmanager to sell you your car at $500 over invoice.	1
	sure beats msrp, and maybe you'll get a sweet deal with a minimum amount of effort.	1
	the worst thing they can say is no.	1
	by the way, advertising starts in september.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2585#msg2585re: low volume [jeffreid]         second, honda and toyota were both down in the month of july.	1

	considering both honda and toyota are supposed to be tops in the fe arena and that doesn't seem to be helping them much if those figures are indeed correct.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2586#msg2586re: genesis and iphone [richard124]        try turning the iphone off and then back on while it's plugged into the port, then select ipod function to see if it'll recognize it that way.       	1

	the car still does not recognize the iphone.	1
	it won't allow you to select the ipod function.	1
	everything i have tried gives the same result:  the phone starts beeping and the message on the car's monitor says it is scanning the device.	1
	after 30 seconds or so it says that it does not recognize the device.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2588#msg2588re: low volume [jeffreid]        assuming you are talking about the entire country, both toyota and honda's declines were higher than 11% and 2% for the month of july (-18.7% and -9.2%,  adjusted for dsr),  hyundai's decline stands at 6.5% (didn't report via dsr).	1
	i do agree with you however, in terms of conquest sales and overall outlook on the brand.	1
	so hyundai sold 619 units of genesis in july, not bad, passed rl already                )  with the full product launch coming up, i would like to think it could garner a few more units        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2589#msg2589test drive        i test drove a premium plus 3.8 genesis today.	1
	i drive a lexus gs350.	1
	the dealer i went to in scottsdale, az had 4 genesis on the lot.	1
	three with premium plus one with premium.	1
	said they were getting 2 with tech within a week.	1
	the sales manager also specifically referred to the special lease rates.	1
	cannot really compare the premium plus version to the lexus.	1
	the version with the tech package would be close.	1
	tried the lexicon stereo.	1
	i definitely prefer the mark levinson system in the lexus.	1
	took the car for a short test drive.	1
	the car feels anemic compared to my lexus.	1
	from a standing start, just 10% throttle on the lexus makes it really scoot.	1
	not so on the genesis.	1
	definitely felt underpowered.	1
	the steering is very heavy.	1
	i know most luxury cars nowadays have light steering.	1
	maybe the heavy steering is supposed to make it feel sporty?	1
	did nothing for me.	1
	i definitely prefer the 09 maxima which is in the same price range (actually cheaper with the nav, etc).	1
	told the dealer to call me when they get the v8.	1
	maybe it will feel like the lexus and nissan v6's.	1
	i was really hoping for more, but the performance just did not measure up for me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2590#msg2590re: test drive [tom17]        completely agree.	1
	i am stunned that people are paying even close to msrp for the genesis.	1
	i had modest expectations and was underwhelmed with a 10 minute test drive of the 6 banger.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2591#msg2591re: test drive [mjameson]        hate to break it to you, you might well be given a gift if you were paying a genesis                 close                to msrp, especially in the east, where most units have been going at or above msrp.	1
	it's a supply and demand issue but if you are stunned people are paying this much for a hyundai, get used to it.	1
	this is certainly not the first (ie azera, veracruz), it is just the                 beginning                (genesis tie-in)        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2592#msg2592re: genesis and iphone [richard124]        there is a special iphone plug you have to get through your hyundai dealer for it to work.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2593#msg2593re: test drive [joe97]        go back in history and look at the people who bought a new, much trumpeted car, at msrp or above.	1
	most of them regretted it, and i doubt this will turn out much differently.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2597#msg2597genesis test drive        drove a genesis today purchased by a client who took me to lunch to show it off.	1
	he commented over and over that he couldn't believe he bought a hyundai.	1
	he owned a lexus.	1
	he commented that the genesis handled and was more powerful than his lexus.	1
	i asked him point-blank if it was better.	1
	he told me it was 'as good' but he needed more seat time to figure that one out.	1
	'so far i think so, which i can't believe', he said.	1
	the interior of the car (especially the leather dash) and the seats were very impressive.	1
	the car was extremely quiet and the 3.8 was very powerful.	1
	i disagree with the commenter above that says the genesis feels underpowered.	1
	i found the 6 very powerful and tons of low-end grunt.	1
	in fact, i found the accelerator a little too sensitive.	1
	the ride was far more firm than i expected but not at all uncomfortable.	1
	steering felt too light.	1
	i can't get why anyone would say it felt 'heavy'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2598#msg2598re: genesis test drive [prosource1]        maybe there was something wrong with the genesis that i test drove.	1
	it was 110+ (the car's display said 87), maybe they cannot handle the heat.	1
	i have driven the infiniti g35 which definately has an overly sensitive throttle.	1
	this genesis was definately underpowered and felt like it had manual steering.	1
	the leather was nice, but the dash seems like it was pulled from the azera (avalon clone) and does not measure up to lexus/infiniti/bmw.	1
	i really was hoping for more.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2599#msg2599re: genesis test drive [prosource1]        everyone who commented about the firm ride of the genesis has been ganged up on by most here.	1
	the ride is definitely much more firm than i expected.	1
	if i want a ultra firm ride, i'll buy something not claiming to be a 'luxury sedan.'	1
	here's a review that comments on the very firm ride and the too-light steering, two comments that members have been bashed for mentioning, with the mods apparently willing to slam down any discussion of negative reviews or traits of the genesis.	1
	maybe this guy who reviewed the car is lying.	1
	http://www.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?aff=nationalrevid=53556makeid=19model- id=9251year=2009revlogtype=20section=reviews                                suspension                                 along with this sporty performance comes a ride that's definitely more taut than most hyundais.	1
	the four-wheel independent suspension, which features a five-link setup in front and back,                   is sensitive to pavement imperfections, transmitting the pockmarks of the road up to the cabin.	1
	this was on mostly smooth california roads, too, which were in much better shape than the ones i normally drive in chicago.	1
	steering                                 where the genesis differs from a number of other performance sedans is that its steering effort is fairly light; it doesn't take much exertion to turn the wheel.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2600#msg2600re: test drive [mjameson]        why, because it's a hyundai?	1
	this is nothing new, by the way, if you want to talk history - demand and supply have always dictated pricing adjustments, especially at pre-sell periods (where genesis is now) and initial launches.	1
	yeah, those paying 3k+ above msrp on a honda fit and other small cars must have a sour taste in the mouth, right                                don't patronize those paying above msrp, espeically in the luxury segment.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2601#msg2601re: genesis test drive [mjameson]        on the same review, it says the following:                                 the superior dynamics afforded by rwd were eminently apparent on winding mountain roads.	1
	the genesis navigates tight corners like a much smaller car  body roll is well checked and the balanced chassis encourages you to push it harder.	1
	the azera, in comparison, offers softer responses when traveling on undulating roads; it's more of a cruiser, whereas the genesis is a carver.	1
	to me, the genesis is the first car in the segment i've found where it has a balanced ride (perfect solution); handling was superb and very engaging feedback.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2602#msg2602re: test drive [joe97]        i think the risk is greater because it's a hyundai trying to broach a new market segment for hyundai, and because we're just starting to see less than glowing reviews of certain aspects of the car, such as the (my opinion after testing one) harsh suspension and over boosted steering.	1
	i'd say the same thing about the prius as far as risk is concerned - if gas prices fall dramatically, people that paid msrp+ for a prius will suddenly see priuses selling for less than msrp, and feel burned.	1
	it's happened before.	1
	different cars and reasons, same outcome.	1
	but this discussion is about the genesis.	1
	the mods will find any excuse to shut down those that dare speak any way but glowingly of the genesis, so i better not fall into the trap of getting distracted by other cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2603#msg2603re: genesis test drive [joe97]        that's why i provided the link.	1
	that way, you can read the whole article.	1
	i pulled out the sections that spoke to the characteristics of the genesis i do not care for, and would prevent me from buying it; the overly firm suspension and overly boosted steering.	1
	by the way, car makers can do firm suspensions without it being 'harsh.'	1
	bmw is a shining example of this, as is audi.	1
	their suspensions are firm but supple.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2606#msg2606re: genesis test drive [mjameson]        yep, my test drive was exactly the opposite of yours.	1

	it is a little sad that this forum went from being pretty informative to somewhat immature in tone.	1
	while i think that there have been some obnoxious posts here lately, i also think there seems to be irrational intolerance for those voicing criticisms of the genesis, too.	1
	the question everyone will hopefully ask themselves is whether they want these forums to be open to all opinions and viewpoints, as long as they are respectfully worded, or just a place where people are going to be exposed to only to positive posts about the genesis.	1
	i belong to the lexus forums, and there is pretty much a policy of complete tolerance there for criticism of lexus vehicles, and it makes for much more productive discussion, especially for those in the market for a particular car, and needing to hear the cons, as well as the pros.	1

	let's ignore those who are trying to disrupt and just stick to the subject.	1
	that way we don't encourage those who are only here to rile people up and we can continue to talk reasonably about this fascinating new car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2617#msg2617re: some truth [moses6]        the mods can correct me but aside from bashing, trolling and personal attacks, everything else should be fair game.	1
	for example, when someone criticized the genesis for being too expensive, i had disagreed with my reasonings.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2621#msg2621re: genesis test drive [mjameson]        funny, here's an opposite opinion regarding the genesis suspension (comparison between the mercedes e550 and the genesis):                                 http://www.motivemag.com/pub/feature/versus/motive.shtml                                'the two cars are almost dynamic opposites  in the benz, every road irregularity, every crumbled bit of rock dropped from a cliff is transmitted to the driver.	1
	the hyundai erases those small details completely...'                                'the most surprising thing about the hyundai's suspension is that it's actually been stiffened significantly beyond the korean market car's.	1
	but it is still much softer than the benz, and biases the car toward cruising.	1
	it exhibits a level of insulation that'll appeal more to traditional luxury buyers than those expecting extreme road-carving performance.'	1
	btw, i prefer not to feel 'every crumbled bit of rock' on the road...                                for those getting confused about all the conflicting reviews, the best thing to do is go drive the genesis and its competitors (bmw 5, mercedes e, lexus gs, infinity m45).	1
	if you like the feel of the bmw 5, then the genesis is too soft for you.	1
	if you like the lexus gs, then the genesis is too firm.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2624#msg2624discover genesis yesterday        i took a test drive at the event yesterday in wilmington de.	1
	i bought an infiniti m45x a couple of months ago, and was interested in seeing how the genesis performed.	1
	the car looks fine from the outside.	1
	the interior is nice, but the simplicity of the design seems to be as much about economical manufacturing as an all out attempt at luxury.	1
	like the azera, the genesis interior looks a little empty.	1
	there's not a lot of detail, though what's there is nicely done.	1
	in contrast, the infiniti has a really interesting interior design, with  a combination of curved wood and aluminum surfaces that look and feel more luxurious.	1
	the design makes a statement, while the hyundai provides a generic sense of refinement.	1
	the quality of the leather in the genesis was a notch below the infiniti, as were the materials on the dash.	1
	comparing it to the infiniti was interesting.	1
	the genesis is quieter, with a softer but not too floaty ride.	1
	the steering in both cars is light, but the infiniti is definitely more sporty, and has that psychic handling that people talk about.	1
	i really liked the tech interface and control knob on the genesis.	1
	the navigation display, with the letters and numbers in a semi-circle was a perfact match when using the knob.	1
	it's a little more intuitive than the infiniti, though the m45 has a  touch-screen and voice command for some functions that the genesis doesn't have.	1
	the most important thing about the genesis is that it supplies most of the amenities that the infiniti has for $20,000 less.	1
	there are probably dozens of areas where hyundai used slightly less expensive materials, and designed the car for an ease of manufacturing that saved them money against other luxury cars.	1
	but in most respects they pulled it off.	1
	it looks like a luxury car and drives like one.	1
	it actually drives like a good luxury car.	1
	but as others have pointed out, mb, bmw, and infiniti have proven reputations in various technology, design and luxury areas that the genesis approaches but doesn't quite meet.	1
	that being said, the car is far nicer than a lexus es in every way, though it's no ls460.	1
	if i was in the market for any sedan costing around $40,000 the genesis would stand alone at the top of the list.	1
	that it even comes within shouting distance of much more expensive cars is remarkable.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2625#msg2625re: upcoming marketing efforts [dborth]         you consider yahoo korea 'marketing dollars'?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2626#msg2626genesis review        ok, folks, i've driven the car for a couple of days now so here is my owner biased review:                                the car is a 3.8 with tech package.	1
	first of all the car is replacing a 2005 chrysler 300 touring model.	1
	i also own a 1996 bmw 850ci (that's the 12 cylinder one).	1
	when you compare either the chrysler or bmw interior to the genesis there is no comparison.	1
	only the genesis truly looks like a luxury car.	1
	i read a review of the genesis on some other site yesterday where someone complained that her  base model genesis bounced all over the highway and was very noisy especially when being passed by another car or when passing.	1
	my car is not noisy and doesn't bounce on the highway.	1
	it is perfectly smooth and and comfortable.	1
	others have said that the car doesn't seem to have much power.	1
	i think it may be because the transmission is extremely smooth that one doesn't get the 'lurching' forward feel when accelerating.	1
	if you pay attention to the speedometer when accelerating you see that it moves forward at a very nice clip ( make that fast).	1
	you are entering the highway and up to speed in an instant.	1
	the scathing review of the base model said that the seats in her car had melted from the heat.	1
	my seats have not melted yet.	1
	i live in south florida where it is in the high 90s with bright sun.	1
	one feature that it does not have that the chrysler does have is movable foot pedals.	1
	i believe i can live without the movable pedals since it has about a hundred features that neither  the chrysler or the bmw have.	1
	i can't figure out where they put 17 speakers but my ears tell me they are there somewhere.	1
	there is no way you can crank up the sound system all the way.	1
	it will knock your teeth out without distortion.	1
	i still have not managed to get my iphone to play in ipod mode yet.	1
	hopefully it will work once i get the proper cord (i have ordered it).	1
	the scathing reviewer also complained that the headlights were too bright and made her eyes red.	1
	i have not driven mine at night yet but i can't imagine it is going to hurt my eyes.	1
	my guess is the scathing review was written by a sales person for some other car.	1
	when the car was first was being designed it was supposed to be a car with everything for $30,000.00.	1
	if one hasn't been living in a cave for the last several years they would know that the dollar has crashed against nearly every currency and thus the car had to cost more than $30,000.00 with everything.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2628#msg2628the genesis        i've been reading this forum for some time now and also have driven the genesis premium v6 and here are my thoughts..                                genesis is much more imposing when seen in person.	1
	it truly has a luxury look to it on the exterior etc.	1
	inside is luxurious and yet simple and clean.	1
	the leather on the dash is a great touch.	1
	the center dash console is eloquent.	1
	note: loved the floating instrument panel that floats (drove it at night).	1
	295hp has plenty of get up and go for your money.	1
	loved the beige leather with the dark carpet.	1
	best comfortable seats yet from hyundai.	1
	i've had 4 hyundai's since 96 and currently in the azera and will be upgrading to the genesis later this year.	1
	will likely buy at least the v6 tech or v8 tech.	1
	each new model that they come out is far superior to their last effort.        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2630#msg2630re: genesis review [joe97]        i'm sure that the manual shows where the speakers are.	1
	also if i look around the car, i'm sure i could locate them.	1
	the sound is truly awesome.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2631#msg2631        i went to the driver event in wilmington, de today, drove both the 6 and 8, then sat in back as my wife drove both.	1
	interesting that the 6 felt better going over the simulated broken pavement/expansion joints, maybe cause its lighter.	1
	the 6 seemed to 'get moving' quicker once you floored it, but the 8 was a rocket once it got into its torque curve.	1
	when i sat in back and my wife floored it, i could feel myself being pushed into the seat.	1
	at 6'3' and 310lbs, i was easily able to get a comfy drivers position.	1
	headroom was tight in back for me though.	1
	the controls for adjusting the side mirrors seemed a little cheesy, but everything else in dash was good.	1
	i don't remember seeing power outlets in back, could be an issue for those with kids.	1
	the exterior looks much nicer in person than in pics, i like the titanium finish.	1
	the interior is somewhat 'understated' as others have pointed out, not necessarily a bad thing, unless you need lots of buttons.	1
	the sound system rocks.	1
	it might not work with my zune, and the sales staff didn't know what a zune was, so no answer there.	1
	the leather seemed the same in both cars to me, but my wife commented that the 8 felt 'better' to her, and the staff acknowledged that the leather did differ between the 2 cars.	1
	all in all, i was favorably impressed with both models.       	1

	i came home excited and began doing some research and homework.	1
	i later decided to take my better half for a test drive.	1
	she loved the car...                                we began to talk seriously about the 3.8 fully loaded (premium w/ tech).	1
	my dealer experience was not what i would have expected.	1
	i was prepared to make the purchase that night, and, all they wanted to know was what payment i had in mind.	1
	i told them i already had financing and not to worry.	1
	they also were pushing the lease, and, i still do not know why.	1
	there were a number of tactics, delays, and mis-representations that took place.	1
	finally, i was told by the sales manager that they didn't need or want to sell the only fully-loaded car on the lot.	1
	my wife and i got up to leave after over two hours (including test drive with the saleman) and i was offered 2.5% over invoice as i walked out the door.	1
	it was the first offer that wasn't sticker price...                                this was at an import dealer that i had 12 years of recent service history with my last two cars.	1
	i expect that bmw, infinity, benz or even acura  honda will treat me a little better.	1
	if this company wants to compete with the luxury market then the dealers will need to step it up - imho.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2635#msg2635re: poor dealer experience - columbus, ohio [ricwhite]        the two closest two dealers have terrible reputations for sales and service.	1
	it was 7 years ago that i bought my last car.	1
	i have been locked into this import dealer for service with the past two purchases (12 years), and, it is getting worse every year.	1
	my wife owns a honda and the service is outstanding.	1
	it just gets better...  my concerns is that if i were to look past the initial experience and get this great car, only then be bitter about the service over the next few years.	1
	i am beginning to think that hyundai should have branded this car as a new company/line and given the dealers the same type of attention and market uplift.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2636#msg2636re: poor dealer experience - columbus, ohio [ricwhite]        our last hyundai shopping experience was quite an adventure, we went to our local dealer looking to trade in our sonata for an azera last august.	1
	they said they could locate a limited in one of our two desired color combos, they never called back.	1
	two days later we called them and they said 'they'd get right on it'.	1
	we were fully committted to buying this car and again, they never returned our call.	1
	this was from the same dealer that 1.5 yrs prior gave us a great deal and really were top-notch during the whole transaction (i heard they had a complete management changeover~and definately not for the better).	1
	giving up in disgust we then shot email inquiries to other dealers within 300 miles, only 2 got back to us.	1
	one dealer had what we wanted on the lot and we negotiated the best we could without actually being in person.	1
	we got the numbers into our comfort range and the day we were going to go there with our money in hand, the sales manager called us and said they were off by $2000, but if we were willing to give up $1000 off our offer they could do the deal.	1
	no thanks                we contacted a lot in vegas (since we go there often) and i must say they seem very comitted to getting deals done, and if we weren't so pleased w/ our current infinity g and we needed more back seat room we'd be looking them up for a closer look at the genesis.	1
	i'm still having a hard time thinking of hyundai as a premium brand although the veracruz, azera and especially the genesis are definately cars moving closer to the mark.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2643#msg2643re: question about lease deal at orange county [greensander]        well, i'm not an expert on leasing by any means, but some quick math says that your dealer is looking to get about $1100 over msrp for the car you are quoting.	1
	the lease deal that hma is 'offering' almost certainly has the dealer discounting the car down to around invoice.	1
	sounds like most dealers are not currently willing to discount the genesis much at all, and certainly not to an invoice deal.	1
	that should be where the difference is in the payment.	1
	not sure on the monthly lease charge.	1
	my state has something called a 'rental receipt tax' on leases.	1
	i think these taxes are designed to make up for some of the revenue lost on a lease versus a purchase.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2644#msg2644re: question about lease deal at orange county [greensander]        when i leased my azera in 06, very few hyundai dealerships would honor the advertised lease promotions.	1
	they 'pretended' to when they initially talked to me but then when the numbers were run, i noticed they were off -- sometimes way off.	1
	for example,  in 2006 hyundai was offering the azera for $299/mo.	1
	one dealership ended up with a number of around $525/mo.	1
	when i compared the numbers, the big difference was in the cap.	1
	cost.	1
	the 'lease deal' was subject to the dealership willing to substantially discount the price.	1
	most dealerships would not (they said 'could' not) do it for financial reasons.	1
	but i did finally find one dealership that would honor the advertised lease deal.	1
	so, i mostly view 'lease deals' as a bait and switch technique.	1
	if you call the dealership and mention it, they will always say 'yes' to the advertised lease programs.	1
	then when you get there, you find out that they really won't go that low.	1
	i was actually so disturbed by my experiences that i called hyundai corporate offices to complain and they reaffirmed to me that dealerships have full freedom to modify the lease terms as they see fit.	1
	the advertised 'lease deals' are really just a best case scenario that depends upon the dealership's willingness to discount the car to rock bottom pricing.	1
	in fact, with the 06 azera lease deal, the cap.	1
	cost was $1000 below invoice (via a hyundai rebate) and one dealership told me that they would actually lose money on the car short term since hyundai wouldn't reimburse them for quite a long time.	1
	most dealerships just aren't willing to do that -- especially the smaller low volume dealerships.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2645#msg2645re: question about lease deal at orange county [ricwhite]        then hyundai needs to stop advertising these 'ridiculous' leases.	1
	if the dealers won't honor them, it amounts to false advertising; if the dealer tells you one thing over the phone and then switches the story at the dealership, that's bait and switch.	1
	both tactics are illegal and both hyundai and the dealerships (and maybe the dealer personnel) can and should be sued in a federal court       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2647#msg2647re: poor dealer experience - columbus, ohio [northcoastohio]        if an accord meets your needs, then imo you were looking at the wrong hyundai.        	1

	my intent was not to debate the accord purchase or get off topic.	1
	i really only                 need                safe and reliable transporation.	1
	the genesis has the appeal to make me consider i                 wanted                more than the fully loaded accord - or other sedan in that class.	1
	the issue i had was with the dealer purchase experience and decline in past service from this dealer.	1
	any new car, regardless of make or model,  from this dealer would have resulted in a similar situation.	1
	so in a way the comfort level with the dealer is also a need (and not just a want) to feel good about the whole thing.	1
	that was the only point i am making.	1
	sorry if we are getting off topic.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2649#msg2649re: question about lease deal at orange county [genesis6]        all lease deals that are advertised on a national level are this way.	1
	the mfr throws a discount out there on a particular car.	1
	a dealer may or may not have the model in stock that is being advertised.	1
	also, the main issue is this, the mfr is giving away money that doesn't belong to them.	1
	it's like buying my lunch on your tab without your permission.	1
	in the end, the mfr gets off the hook by having the fine print say that the advertised lease rate is dependent on 'dealer contribution'.	1
	this 'problem' is not hyundai exclusive by any means, and really , this all boils down to reading the only part of any ad of any kind that matters, the tiny print at the bottom.	1
	that's where the details are.	1
	also, i would hesitate to say that the scenarios that i see here are 'bait and switch'.	1
	especially not to the dealer.	1
	the dealer did not advertise the lease and did not advertise the terms.	1
	if a person asks for a $xxx/mo lease, the dealer can say yes to that and set the money factor and final transaction price any way they like.	1
	you will have to make up the difference in cash to get to the payment that you want.	1
	as to suing the mfr, or the dealer.	1
	think about this.	1
	when the ad says in print that the retailer will set the final price, how can it then be illegal to do so?	1
	one should read all of the details before getting too far into something as complicated as a lease.	1
	if you come to terms on the price of the car first, and then decide on your method of financing (cash, installment loan, lease), you will probably save yourself a lot of headache.	1
	one last thing.	1
	most all of the lease deals you see on tv say in the fine print that they are examples.	1
	it doesn't matter if it's hyundai, m-b, lexus, or daewoo.	1

	toyota by 11% and honda at 2%.	1
	hyundai was down 6%.	1
	i think this is interesting in that honda and hyundai both took some share from toyota                                overall sales or just car sales???	1
	a strange assertion - toyota is the only one of the 3 mfgrs you mention that is really in the truck/large suv business.	1
	it is very difficult to sell a tundra or sequoia these days.	1
	and i would imagine that those sales are down a whole lot more than a mere 11%.	1
	depending on toyota's product mix they may actually have increased their car market share relative to hyundai (or honda).       	1

	look at hyundai's sales satisfaction ranking on jd power.	1
	premium car shoppers want a premium buying experience, not deceptive practices suited to .	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2655#msg2655re: low volume [captain2]        this is off-topic.	1
	but, sequoia was up quite a bit in july and are going strong ytd.	1
	also, relative to hyundai and honda, toyota did not advance higher in terms of market share, compared to other makers with smaller declines, that is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2656#msg2656re: question about lease deal at orange county [houdini1]        to be fair about the leases, i also had a similar negative experience looking into an acura tl lease.	1
	they had a $349/mo (i think that's right) advertised lease deal back in 06 and i also remember that after the numbers were run, it was over $500.	1
	so, i don't think the lease problems are exclusive to hyundai.	1
	i think the advertised lease deals are the 'best' possible scenario if everything comes together and the dealer is willing to discount the price substantially.	1
	it goes up from there depending upon the dealership and what they're willing to do.	1
	i think that's true for any auto maker, not just hyundai, although i only have experience with hyundai and acura.	1
	and whether you see the lease deals advertised in print or on tv, there's always that 500 word miniature print disclosure at the end which lays out all of those 'however' terms.       	1

	m/t threw some impressive numbers tested from the car and more than favorable commentary/impressions.	1
	interesting to note the residual values over 3 years, in particular, for the genesis has been predicted to be tops in the class, higher than bmw 550i, lexus gs460, infiniti m45, mercedes-benz e550 - this has been a weak spot for hyundai, but with the onslaught of quality products, the tide seems to be changing.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2658#msg2658hyundai genesis - when to buy?	1
	i test drove the v6 hyundai genesis yesterday and was impressed with the styling, confort, and performance for a car in this price range.	1
	all of the pre-advertisements and postings on the internet suggested that a loaded v6 would only run about $35,000, but the dealership i visited in central fl had several loaded 3.8 models going for $40,000.	1
	the cheapest base model genesis was stickered at $36,000.	1
	although these were the initial window sticker prices, they seemed to be about 3k to 4k higher than i expected.	1
	i left the dealership before engaging in any attempts at bargaining with the sales rep, so maybe there was some flexibility in the price.	1
	i am looking for some advice from this forum on whether anyone thinks the genesis prices may drop in a few months after the initial hype wears off and inventories increase.	1
	or does anyone forsee prices actually rising as a result of the market seeing this car as being undervalued?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2659#msg2659re: hyundai genesis - when to buy?	1
	[bman900]        the base genesis starts at $33,000.	1
	when you start adding the various packages it can go up to $40,000 [v8...$42000].	1
	in my area the dealers are all quoting msrp, but i did see a few sales were under sticker price.	1

	anyway...could be the way the iphone is set up as it's not a dedicated mp3 player the audio system sees the other functions and doesn't connect with the mp3 player portion of it.	1
	if that is the case, it's unfortunate.	1
	try one more thing.	1
	plug the iphone into the input while the audio system is off and make sure you have the mp3 player already playing, then turn the audio system on and see if it picks it up then.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2662#msg2662lease price  first impressions        i picked up a new 2009 hyundai genesis yesterday.	1
	since i have not seen a lease section for the genesis, i thought i would post how my lease deal came out, since i think it was a really great deal.	1
	the deal                -------------------------                                2009 hyundai genesis v6 - with premium package                msrp $35,000 (includes $750 destination charge)                                24 month lease                12k miles per year                $1500 total out of pocket (includes tax, title, everything)                $435.00 a month (includes tax and everything)                                i don't know about you, but that is a stellar deal.	1
	a few notes about how they got there.	1
	first, i was turning in my leased 2006 hyundai azera, so there was some lease loyalty customer cash available.	1
	the dealership had some kind of $500 coupon available that they allowed me to use.	1
	note also that they somehow rolled my last two payments on my azera into the lease ($427.00 a month for the azera).	1
	they said something about hyundai having some type of deal to help absorb those, i dont know if they were just talking about the loyality cash or what.	1
	i have been pricing out leases on cars for months, this is the best deal i have seen.	1
	driving impressions                ----------------------------                                i drove 80 miles to pick up this car.	1
	i had never even driven a genesis before, so this was a bit of a leap of faith.	1
	my genesis is the cabernet pearl red color.	1
	wow, what a color.	1
	i was a little worried about the color, since i had not seen it in person, and in pictures, it looked a little bit boring, but when i pulled up and saw it waiting for me out front, shinning in the sun, i would take this color over all the others, it just sparkles.	1
	in short, you can't go wrong with the red.	1
	the interior is what i call the 'football' brown color.	1
	the floor is black, the doors have black on them, and the dash and seats are wrapped in brown leather.	1
	my wife was hot for that lexus a few years ago that had the coach leather interior, this is what the brown reminded me of.	1
	the first thing i noticed is when i put my hand on the driver seat to lean in and look at the dash.	1
	this is leather you want to touch.	1
	i have owned a jag s-type, 300c, various toyota leather clad vehicles, and this leather is the nicest i have ever seen or touched, it is buttery smooth.	1
	wait a sec, i gotta go fondle my car, be right back.	1
	#61514;                                let me be frank, there is just no way this car should be $35,000, it should be more, or at least, i shouldn't be allowed to drive it for a measly $435 a month (though i am glad i am                .	1
	when you look at this thing, it looks like a $55,000 car to me.	1
	i drove this thing home, and to work, and honestly, i feel like i am driving a mercedes or a bmw, quite a step up from my azera.	1
	pfff, the local bmw dealership had a 2 year old bmw 5 series, with 46k miles, seats look worn and crappy, and they wanted $37,000 for it hahahah ya right seeeee ya.	1
	ok, lets talk about the drive.	1
	it's accelerates smooth, smoother than the azera.	1
	the v6 is a beast, and will embarrass throngs of other vehicles out there.	1
	some mag tested it at 6.3 seconds to 60, i'll take it.	1
	the car feels tight, put together well, a whole different ball game than the azera.	1
	the azera was nice, but this is niiiccceee.	1
	here are the only complaints i have so far.	1
	the first one is a weird one.	1
	there isn't any place for your sunglasses!	1
	strange omission, all i can assume is that they got the interior looking just great, and someone forgot along the way.	1
	also, the bluetooth module seems to take the space where the sunglasses would go.	1
	oh well, i am parking my sunglasses above the sun visor... no big deal, but it surprised me a little.	1
	the other thing i noticed however is a slightly bigger deal, on my drive to work, i travel 20 miles on a concrete highway.	1
	got to tell you, at least for my first run, that it was pretty bouncy.	1
	i am trying to be optimistic, and hope that since the car only has 100 miles on it, that things need to loosen up a little, and i need to get use to the car.	1
	however as far as this mornings commute is concerned, unfortunately, my azera was a smoother ride.	1
	if any other genesis owners have experienced this, and know if it changes, improves, or whatever, i would appreciate hearing from you.	1
	anyways, its an awesome car, i'm paying per month what i was for my azera, and it's much better.	1
	so go get one while they still have these crazy residuals and money factors.	1
	so what are you waiting for, you're still reading this arent you!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2663#msg2663re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        hey sthede,                                congratulations!	1
	would you mind posting the 'net cap cost' on the genesis lease deal?	1
	also, please post the money factor number and the residual percentage.	1
	i'd really be interested in those.	1
	i would assume that the money factor and residual numbers are all pretty standardized for all genesis leases.	1
	the net cap cost, however, is where the variations will probably occur.	1
	it is that variable that makes the difference in what the bottom line monthly payment will be.	1
	if you were able to negotiate a lower cap cost --- maybe $500 over invoice or even at or below invoice with rebates -- then you can probably get close to the 'advertised' lease deal numbers.	1
	if, on the other hand, the dealer wants more 'profit' and charges close to msrp for the net cap cost, then your monthly payment could skyrocket.	1
	i'm just curious to know what your specific numbers were.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2664#msg2664re: genesis review [richard124]        you could look around the car, but...in some locations there could be two drivers, but the grille can make it look like there may only be a singular driver behind it.	1
	the difference between the top (17 speaker) lexicon system and the regular (14-speaker) one is the addition of 2 mid-drivers in the front doors and the added tweeter for the center.	1
	you're right, the system does sound very, very good.	1
	personally, i would prefer a little more umph from the lower frequencies as you lose some of that when cruising at highway speed with the windows down.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2665#msg2665re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        just an 'oh, by the way': your thinking that the bluetooth interface takes up the space where the sunglasses overhead spot would be is correct.	1
	you can have one or the other, but not both.	1
	same thing in the '08 (or i assume '09) azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2666#msg2666re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        please explain the 'bouncy' ride.	1
	i mean...when i think of bouncy, i think of those cars where the springs were cut and no other upgrades were made to the suspension.	1
	i tested a 3.8 w/premium plus (18' wheels)...ride was very compliant, yet stiffer than that of my azera (which by the way...i don't have the suspension problems with my azera), anyway...  the suspension of the genesis soaked up road irregularities, dips and pot holes with a firm control that didn't translate much to the steering wheel.	1
	is the ride as soft as that of the azera, not at all.	1
	i think with the genesis, hyundai found a good balance between highway cruiser/and semi-sport tuning because you certainly don't get the body roll in turns and corners that you get with the azera.	1
	in short, while i do love the ride in my azera (especially on the highway), the genesis offers a much better all around suspension in my opinion.	1
	great review by the way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2667#msg2667re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        check the air pressure in your tires.	1
	cars are frequently shipped with over-inflated tires to prevent flat-spotting in transit.	1
	your dealer should have bled off the excess air while prepping the car for delivery, but he may have neglected to do this.	1
	over-inflated tires will contribute to a bouncy ride.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2668#msg2668re: genesis and iphone [allmet33]        allmet33                i'm pretty sure it's the cable.	1
	now that  i have actually read the manual, it specifically says not to use the cable that came with the phone to plug into a computer.	1
	i have ordered the cable over the internet which is made by hyundai specifically for several 2009 cars including the genesis.	1
	i know the dealer where i bought the car has the cable but they are some distance away so i figured it was easier to order it over the internet and have it delivered to the door.	1
	takes a little longer but easier.	1
	someone posted the location of the speakers.	1
	there is more than one under some of the covers.	1
	i can not critasise the sound system at all.	1
	i think it is awesome.	1
	i think the most i have ever had in a car before is eight speakers.	1
	we only have five in the house.	1
	i may park the car in the living room.	1
	thanks       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2669#msg2669re: lease price  first impressions [ricwhite]        here is a copy of the deal they emailed me originally.	1
	keep in mind that this was for the base genesis, the one i got was 2k more, since it had the premium package.	1
	to get the car with the premium package, i either had to put an additional $500 down (which is what i did), or my payment would go up to $458.00 a month (from $435.00 a month).	1
	here is the original deal on a $33,000 genesis v6 base (remember, i am getting some help since i am already a hyundai owner):                                genesis v6 msrp: $33,000, payment $ 425.10. no additional or hidden costs.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2671#msg2671re: lease price  first impressions [allmet33]        bouncy ride meaning, that you move in your seat 1 inch up and down.	1
	or to put it more colorfully, if your passenger was pamela anderson in a t-shirt, the ride would be noticably fun                .	1
	it's not jarring, but when its happening, by no means would someone call the ride 'smooth'.	1
	that's the way it is on the first half of the highway i drive, when i hit the newest cement part, it smooths out, and everything is very nice.	1
	obviously, how nicely you think the car rides, will be based on the road you are on.	1
	i would chalk it up to the road being funny, except for a year i have driven this exact highway with the azera, and never bounced like that, with the genesis i do.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2672#msg2672re: lease price  first impressions [jimbres]        thanks for the tip on the tires being over inflated, i will check into it.	1
	the only thing that makes me think that may not be it, is the car has a tire pressure monitoring system, so you would think fudging with the tire pressure by anyone would set the system off.	1
	i know in our other car, i let the air out by about 8 pounds on one tire, and the system started complaining.	1
	i'll check into it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2673#msg2673re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...i do understand what you mean now.	1
	as far as the ride in the azera...it's cushy soft (buick-like) and the genesis has more of an all around sport tuning as compared to the azera.	1
	sorta like going from a caddy to a bmw.	1
	the caddy soaks everything up and the bmw makes you notice more due to a firmer tuning.	1
	you know...another thing too...the seats.	1
	while the seats in the genesis are soft to the touch and comfortable to sit in, they are quite a bit firmer than those in the azera.	1
	i know in my azera...i sink in a bit so that also contributes to the 'soft' ride you feel.	1
	just a thought.	1
	i mean...after driving the azera and getting used to it, something that's got a firmer suspension could take some getting used to.	1
	the tpms won't make too much fuss unless it falls below a certain point.	1
	you could very well be suffering from too much air in the tires.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2674#msg2674re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        i think i read in the manual that the tire monitoring system only tells you when the tires are low.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2675#msg2675genesis 3.8 engine        does anyone expect the current 3.8 liter 290 hp engine in the genesis sedan to be tuned for more horsepower in a mid-cycle year change, for example for the 2011 model year?	1
	if the horsepower per litre in the v6 were equivalent to the current 4.6 liter output, then the 3.8 could potentially produce 310 hp.	1
	if i knew this was probable i may hold off for a couple years.	1
	i believe the genesis coupe may already offer specs similiar to this for its v6.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2676#msg2676re: review from m/t v8 genesis [jeffreid]        i've read the cd, mt and newspaper reviews, as well as those at 4 websites.	1
	i want to see what they say after having driven one for over 5,000 miles.	1
	i agree that most car magazine ads and some websites are too positive on most reviews-don't anger the advertisers.	1
	i recall that the early reviews of the azera made it sound like the next best thing to a lexus, acura, infiniti, bmw, etc.	1
	and no problems.	1
	that's what led me to it, as i had never even noticed hyundai before.	1
	many of us later learned, it's a good car, but not without a few problems.	1
	perhaps hyundai has some qualtiy control problems internally or with it suppliers.	1
	this has been a killer for several american makes over the years.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2677#msg2677re: genesis 3.8 engine [bman900]        i don't think it'll change for at least the first 3 years of production.	1
	the v-6 on the coupe will be producing 309 hp and the turbo-charged 4-banger that will kick out 223 hp.	1
	what would really be sweet is the coupe being offered with the v-8...whoa!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2678#msg2678re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        can you pl.	1
	provide me the dealer details.	1
	i know the advertized lease on this vehicle is $419+ttl.	1
	i am just wondering about the down payment.	1
	the dealer i spoke to here in detroit mentioned about $2200 as the down payment.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2679#msg2679re: genesis 3.8 engine [bman900]        the 290hp rating on the v6 is with regular unleaded.	1
	if you run premium, the engine is rated at a few more horses.	1
	this may get it closer to 300hp.	1
	it seems a little odd that hma would advertise the v8 with premium fuel and then leave the v6 with regular, but it is what it is.	1
	matter of fact, the books on the genesis do not even offer a premium fuel rating on the v6.	1
	just seems odd.	1
	one other note.	1
	on the leases, the money factor is something that can vary.	1
	just like a dealer can mark up a finance rate to make some back end money, they can mark up the money factor also.	1
	additionally, the mf will vary based on credit quality.	1
	just thought you would like to know.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2680#msg2680re: genesis 3.8 engine [jeffreid]        if i remember correctly, there was a posting one time that indicated the hp rating on the v-8 with regular gas would be 368 hp.	1
	i've usually heard of a 4-5 hp increase between regular and unleaded, but this is 7.  if that is the case and using the same math, the power on the v-6 using premium fuel would be 297 hp.	1
	i guess with the v-6, it's not so much about the power, but bang for the buck and with the v-8, well...it's about the power, but even at 368 hp...that's still a damn good number!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2683#msg2683re: genesis 3.8 engine [jeffreid]        hi jeff,                                i've been reading your very knowledgeable comments on this forum and so i thought i should direct my question straight to you -                i'm currently driving a acura mdx and the lease on which runs through jan 09. i've decided that the genesis 4.6 will be my next car.	1
	now do you think the current lease special on the genesis will last until then?	1
	or do you think that by then the dust might have settled and i could possibly buy the car at an even more bargain price (somewhere between invoice and msrp) ?	1
	i know you don't have a crystal ball but to answer my question i give you the authority to assume you have one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2685#msg2685re: genesis 3.8 engine [allmet33]        i'm with allmet33                                reportedly, hyundai has been manipulating or upgrading v8 tau engine(super charge or turbo charge or expanded displacement or whatever) for vi project or another version of the genesis(just guessing).	1
	but has no plan to do that on v6.	1
	for the genesis coupe,  its v6 may get some tunned but not for the genesis sedan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2686#msg2686genesis - will price rise or fall?	1
	will the genesis prices will go up, down, or remain flat?	1
	i personally think this vehicle is underpriced for what you get.	1
	i am hoping that the mainstream consumers do not figure this out, increase the demand - therefore force the price to go up.	1
	that being said maybe now is the time to grab one of these vehicles.	1
	on the flipside as supplies increase and more dealerships gain inventory it could be easier to bargain a better price in several months.	1
	the dealership i visited 2 days ago only had 4 models in inventory so they were probably less inclined to bargain.	1
	what do you think?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2687#msg2687re: genesis - will price rise or fall?	1
	[bman900]        the transformation of the hyundai brand won't happen over night.	1
	plus supplies will increase while the car market (except for small cars) remains depressed for some time.	1
	so i'm betting the price will go down before it goes up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2688#msg2688re: genesis 3.8 engine [bman900]        as part of the hyundai array of engines, the lambda v6 engine family (3.3l  3.8l) is one of the jewels.	1
	the flexiblity of the engine is vast, as one of hyundai execs neatly noted its full potential, which the engine certainly has not reached in the current form, and with good reasons.	1
	i would have no reason to doubt the full power what this engine could ouput.	1
	in the days of 'mpg', however, consideration of optimizing both fuel economy and power is in, even for a car like the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2689#msg2689re: genesis 3.8 engine [allthatblue]        exactly.	1
	hyundai's plan, at least this point in time, is to spawn the tau into a full family of engines, with the existing 4.6l already in production, plus 5.0l, 5.5l, along with the addition of superchargers and cyclinder deactivation technologies.	1
	the larger engines will probably be housed in the vi (equus replacement, i believe), and not the genesis - so it is presumed the vi won't arrive to this side of the shore anytime soon.	1
	that said, other markets (outside of the domestic market) such as russia or china are both good candidates, along with a luxury brand to boot, especially considering hyundai is the #1 foreign brand in the russian market, and in china, hyundai has  historically done well there.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2690#msg2690re: lease price  first impressions [sthede]        in my mind the red over brown is the color combination that i would like.	1
	they don't clash?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2691#msg2691can genesis owner answer?	1
	i found the following article and the author says that the genesis 'is a fine sedan that's more refined than the sonata and more comfortable  if less engaging  than the genesis.'	1
	http://ask.cars.com/2008/08/hyundai-azera.html                                they are claiming that the azera is a more comfortable car than the genesis?	1
	those of you that have bought the genesis, what have been your impressions so far?	1
	the city i live in has terrible roads, and i wonder if the azera is a better choice for ride comfort than the genesis for my husband and i.                                thank you                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2692#msg2692re: suspension [ksmigel]        i have not checked my tire pressure yet.	1
	but concerning the bouncyness i have experienced on certain roads, i have some thoughts.	1
	first, roads you think would give the genesis trouble, it glides over.	1
	however, only certain types of road anomalies seem to cause the bounce.	1
	second, my genesis 3.8 only has 120 miles on it, and i have only had it two days now.	1
	i guess i should really give myself time to get use to the car, and to let the car break in a little.	1
	someone mentioned the seats being a little different between the azera and the genesis, i agree with that.	1
	this bouncy ride issue i have experienced may very well subside once the seats get broken in.	1
	hey, i would imagine the seats have some type of spring, coil or something in them, and that could cause a bounce when they are brand-new.	1
	i took it for a spin just for fun again tonight, and i didn't notice the bounce very much.	1
	but i will watch for it again tomorrow going to work (my test track), and see if it returns.	1
	more driving impressions                ------------------------------------                                as i mentioned above, i took out my genesis 3.8 for a spin, just for fun.	1
	i came away with a smile on my face.	1
	let me tell you, this car is fast.	1
	man, i punched it getting on the highway, and i was at 80 so fast, scary.	1
	i have had so many cars, mustang gts, jags, 300c, even a stealth twin turbo, and this is as fast as any of them.	1
	i am sure that the v8 is a beast, but if anyone out there is on the fence about the v6, that the 290 hp isn't enough... then maybe you should be looking at sports cars instead of luxury 4 door sedans.	1
	my wife drove it tonight, to run an errand, her biggest complaint was no sunglass holder, and she thought a general lack of storage space.	1
	i don't think i agree about the storage space, theres enough.	1
	but i do agree about the sunglass holder.	1
	she also thought the steering wheel should telescope out a little further, on that i agree, another inch would be perfect, but otherwise it fits me really well, these are nit picks only.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2693#msg2693re: lease price  first impressions [milan13]        i bought/leased my genesis from rosedale hyundai in mn.	1
	just google their name to get to their site if you want.	1
	my sales guy was alan, so you could give him a call and get the straight facts on the deal, hes a nice guy, im sure he would love to sell another genesis.	1
	no one is selling hundreds of genesis cars, so i am sure you can mention the red genesis he sold at the beginning of august, and he will know which deal you are talking about.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2694#msg2694remote start for hyundai genesis        one of the big things i wanted on my next car was remote start.	1
	i live in mn, and in the winter, its the way to go.	1
	so anyways, i have been dreaming about remote start for a year.	1
	well today i started my odyssey to put a remote start into my genesis.	1
	the big road block here is the push button start, and the proximity key system.	1
	in my small town, we have most dealerships, and a few after market shops, but no one even knows what a hyundai genesis is, much less how to handle a complex problem like putting a remote start into a push button car.	1
	the first few places said they couldn't do it, cause they don't know anything about a genesis.	1
	then i spoke to a service manager at a hyundai dealership who said that during training on the genesis, the engineers told everyone they recommended not adding a remote start, since it may mess up the proximity key system.	1
	so in desperation i called the dealership i got my genesis from (they are far away, which is why i didn't call them first), and they had not heard of any warning like that, but they felt very confident they could add one, and had a big after market shop they thought could handle it.	1
	should hear back tomorrow as to what they find out from their uber installer.	1
	i have read that with other models, like the prius, or the infiniti m, and so on, that some people say that you must sacrifice one of your smart keys, and have it permanentely mounted in the car.	1
	and from what i understand, this kills the whole proximity system.	1
	well, in my opinion, that sucks.	1
	i then read some people claiming that if done correctly, you can indeed add a remote start to push button start cars, but you had better use someone who knows what they are doing.	1
	so if anything, a small warning about adding remote start, that it may wind up being a larger than normal headache.	1
	ill keep you posted as to how this comes out.	1
	meanwhile, if anyone else knows anything about this, i would love to know.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2695#msg2695re: lease price  first impressions [mnjasper]        thanks!!!	1
	no the colors don't clash.	1
	i was a little worried about it myself, but when i saw it in person, it looked great, better than any pictures.	1
	the red and brown seem to go together, the black just sinks into the background.	1
	by contrast, i personally thought the all black interior looks nice, but was a little boring in comparison.	1
	btw a good source for real world car pics for any model is cars.com                                they are selling a red genesis on there right now that has the exact same interior as mine.	1
	the only difference is my car has the smaller wheels.	1
	just search all used cars, hyundai, genesis, lol, there are only like 15 of them nationwide, so not to hard to find.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2696#msg2696re: suspension [sthede]        sthede,                                if i am not mistaken the 3.8 has three possible option packages: premium , premium plus, and technology.	1
	which package(s) did you order with your genesis, and how much did these bump the price up?	1
	my budget is $35,000 but i do not want to skimp on options if they are truly worth it.	1
	which options do you recommend and why?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2697#msg2697re: suspension [bman900]        the premium and premium plus packages vary only by tire/wheel size (18' with the premium plus versus 17' for the premium).	1
	i test drove one with the 18' wheels and had the dealer locate one with the 17' wheels, because (1) i don't particularly care for the chrome accents on the 18' wheels, and (2) because i prefer the slightly softer ride that the 55-aspect tires provide compared to the 50-aspect -- 18' -- ones.	1
	the technology package provides the nav.	1
	system, which is fine but for $4000 i can buy a lot of maps and several garmin nuvi's.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2698#msg2698navigation system        i am looking at the maxima and genesis and wonder if anyone can tell me about the nav system on the genesis.	1
	i read where the voice commands are limited and dont operate other things like the hvac like others do.	1
	is this correct.	1
	is anyone else between the maximaand the genesis.	1
	i like the looks of the max better and it may come down to who has the better technology for me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2699#msg2699re: suspension [bman900]        actually...the 3.8 has 4 options, base, premium, premium plus and technology.	1
	base model is $33k                                premium is $35k                                premium plus is $36k (18' wheel upgrade from premium package)                                technology is $40k                                in my opinion, the best bang for buck is the 3.8 w/premium plus.	1
	if you want the tech package, you're better off ponying up the extra $2k and getting the 4.6 w/tech package...you get way more and you don't take a hit in the fe department.	1
	however, this is just my opinion.       	1

	considering i can get a similalry equipped lexus es 350 stickered at $40k for around $35, and which will still be worth 80% of what i paid for it in two years (vs. current hyundai resale values of 50% or less) this approach potentially makes a genesis a poor financial proposition.	1

	one area hyundai skimped on a little is with the whole bluetooth thing.	1
	when you connect with your phone, using bluetooth (which is what 95% of people will be doing with it), it connects to a module above the rear view mirror.	1
	that unit has its own speakers.	1
	when you talk to someone, the sound comes out of those smallish speakers above the mirror, not the sound system.	1
	my toyota sienna mini-van has bluetooth, my 300c had bluetooth, all those systems go through the stereo system.	1
	one plus, is it has voice recognition in it, so all you have to do is push a button on the module, and say 'call home' (or whatever you want), and it will call home, no gps or fancy tech package required.	1
	but the bluetooth speakers were not meant for music...                                maybe you can find somekind of bluetooth adapter to go in the arm rest console, plug it into the jacks, and get the same result.       	1

	as many have already mentioned, the 'premium plus' package is the same as the premium package, just fancier wheels.	1

	i was worried about getting the smaller wheels, simply because i think wheels make or brake a car, and seldom do the smaller wheels look better than the bigger wheels.	1
	but i have to say, the base wheels look very nice, they look more 'classic' to me.	1
	the bigger wheels are very nice also, but they have a 'new design' look to them, and i personally did not find them compelling.	1
	honestly, the base wheels make the genesis look more like a bmw with bbs wheels, at least that's what comes to mind when i look at my car.	1
	the upgraded wheels make the genesis look like something you have never seen before.	1
	one note about the packages, keep in mind that the $4000 for the tech package requires that you have the premium plus package in addition.	1
	that means $3000 + $4000 for the tech.	1
	so if you want gps, and all the goodies, you are looking at $7000 from base sticker... i just couldn't afford it personally, not to mention they are very rare right now (tech packages).       	1

	the dealership i went to in orlando, fl had loaded 3.8s which included every possible option for $40,000.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2717#msg2717re: price gouging [hoopla1991]        in general i agree with your reasoning.	1
	there's no way you, or anyone else, should pay more than sticker for this car in this economy.	1
	the only cars that will bring over msrp are hybrids right now.	1
	i'll guarantee that in 2-3 weeks that dealer will be offering deals below msrp, not because the genesis is a bad car but because it is not such a phenomenal car to drive that kind of demand.	1
	however, you are kidding yourself if you think the lexus will retain 80% of its value after two years, unless you are going to sell it yourself.	1
	maybe you'll get 60% or 65% if you take really good care of it and keep the mileage down, but that is about it.	1
	a friend of mine just traded in a 3 year old es with only 23,000 miles on it and got 22k for it and was very happy.	1
	that was a loaded version he paid about 38k for new.       	1

	as matter of fact, in the snow belt, fwd cars actually have the advantage over rwd counterparts.	1
	i don't have the data to back me up but i'll make a bold statement saying that the majority of the buyers purchase their cars based on price, quality of the product and overall dealer experience.	1

	how much nicer can the buttons push?	1
	yeah, the ls has real wood, ill give them that one.	1
	let's see what you get for an extra $30,000 with the lexus.	1

	back to reality for a minute, i don't know about you, but i think ill put my $30,000 back in my pocket.	1
	the real question is this:  if you went to hyundai with an extra $30,000 to spend on your already awesome genesis, what do you think they would give you?	1
	i bet that is what keeps lexus up at night.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2723#msg2723re: price gouging [dueho]        the genesis 4.6 w/tech package may not be in the same league as the ls460 in some ways, it's the fact taht you can get what you get with the genesis for half of what you would pay for the ls.	1
	heck...the genesis turns out the power it turns out using regular gas and the ls has to run on premium, the genesis gets better gas mileage and uses less gears to accomplish it.	1
	then there's the driving dynamic, which some are saying is pretty close to being on par with that of the ls as well (subjectively arguable).	1
	with hyundai not using the same quality materials that lexus uses, hyundai still managed to put together a very solid vehicle that actually raises the argument of how well it can stack up against the japanese  german offerings in the same vehicle class.       	1

	i'll just throw a few things out there off the top of my head...                                - radar cruise control                - pre-collision system                - knee airbags                - driver and passenger heated/cooled seats                - rear heated/cooled seats with separate a/c and massage                - air ride suspension                - power door close                - power trunk                                as for subjective stuff like leather, wood, materials, fit  finish, etc, you need to hop in an ls and then see how they compare.	1
	and don't forget lexus legendary (ls) reliability and top-notch dealer service.	1
	we've heard how the genesis saw 800k miles of testing.	1
	try at least double that when toyota tested the (original) ls.	1
	are they worth 30k?	1
	let's put those features/technologies into the genesis first and see how much hyundai charges for them.	1
	my point is: bring the genesis to the same level of refinement and technology as the ls, and then you can compare the price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2734#msg2734re: price gouging [captain2]         you should be losing sleep over that last one!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2735#msg2735re: price gouging [dueho]        agree with what you're saying here but you really only skirted the whole dealer service part - because it is largely what made lexus so successful in the 80s/90s and did create a problem at the time for bmw/mb.	1
	is being treated in the 'lexus' manner worth $30k?	1
	-of course not- but it is a very important part of what a lexus really is.	1
	for the ls (and some of the  other lexus models) to be able to maintain its sterling reliabilities despite all those advanced technologies is an accomplishment in itself -  witness what has happened to the german makes lately       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2736#msg2736re: price gouging [dueho]        here's the funny thing...present the genesis without hyundai badging and never tell anyone it's made by hyundai...folks would easily be willing to pay more for it as already witnessed by some of the feedback.	1
	is it what the ls is, clearly not and i don't think anyone is trying to say it is.	1
	however, the fact that a hyundai is being compared in any light to a lexus, infiniti or other premium make says a lot for hyundai.	1
	from a price point, the genesis can be compared to the gs350, but from what you get in  on the car...the gs doesn't stack up, so what's the next model in the lexus stable...the ls.	1
	you've got folks out here that will be willing to foregoe the lexus fineries that the ls offers, save about $20k and still have a very nice, solid car in the genesis.	1
	on the flip side, you will have plenty that will pay the $20k premium just to say they have an ls...it's what makes the world go 'round.	1
	if folks that are shopping infinity m's, benz e's,  bmw 5's are already taking looks a the genesis, what makes you think that someone shopping an ls won't either?	1

	while the ls460 is putting out 380 on premium.	1
	the gs 350 is pumping out 303 hp on premium fuel and the genesis 3.8 is pumping out 290 on regular fuel (speculation of close to 300 on premium fuel).	1
	the gs while it is a luxury make, it's more a luxury sport sedan as opposed to just a luxury car which is what the ls is and the argument on the genesis is all about.	1
	so...do you compare a luxury sport sedan to a luxury sedan or do you compare a luxury sedan to a luxury sedan?	1
	i never said everyone would cross shop, you'll find some that will.	1
	i will probably be less cross shopping as opposed to those tired of paying the premium dollar for gas and maintenance and trading in for something like the genesis...know what i mean?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2742#msg2742re: price gouging [dueho]        i would hope for an extra $30 grand you better get those things.	1
	i think the point all of this lexus vs genesis comparison is trying to demonstrate, is that you can get a car that is nearly equal to the pinnacle of modern luxury sedans, for half the price.	1
	that's good news isn't it?	1
	for years, lexus has dangled their products in front of the world, and they are indeed an object of desire.	1
	sad truth is that the majority of people can't afford their cars.	1
	but they can afford a hyundai!!!!!	1
	woo who!!!	1
	hallelujah!!!	1
	so i think there's a bit of satisfaction knowing that you got practically the same thing, without having to lop your right arm off.	1
	so don't rain on my satisfaction.	1
	just do a side by side comparison on any comparison site, and admit that a majority of the features are the same, but the price certainly is not.       	1

	i said it when talk the genesis first started...this will be the car that will make everyone re-think hyundai.	1
	the fact that it's still in its infancy and being compared to the likes of the japenese and european premium sedans is nothing short of amazing.	1
	the fact that the car causes the debates that it has...is a statement in itself.	1

	now that one actually exists...naysayers still don't want to give props where props are due.	1

	the 4.6l v8 in the gs is tuned down (and w/o di i think) from the same engine in the ls.	1
	i guess lexus doesn't want the gs to steal the thunder from its flagship.	1
	based on the numbers, the hyundai tau v8 is very impressive and neck to neck with lexus' 4.6l.	1
	as for the v6 i think the 2gr still has a slight advantage over the hyundai 3.8l v6.	1
	however, that gap is really virtually unexist in real world driving, moothness, on the other hand is another story.	1
	since i haven't tried the v6 genesis myself i really couldn't comment on that but so far i haven't seen a single review about any other v6 that has yet to out-smooth the toyota 2gr-fse.	1
	so...do you compare a luxury sport sedan to a luxury sedan or do you compare a luxury sedan to a luxury sedan?	1
	trust me, the gs is about as 'sporty' as the genesis... i think we can safely say that it is an apple-to-apple comparison.	1

	that's the wrong question to ask.	1
	i'd love to buy a lexus for all the obvious reasons, but there's no way i'll pay what they're asking.	1
	on the other hand, to get a genesis that is so close in quality for significantly less, that's a no brainer.	1
	so the question in my mind is not who will go from a lexus to a genesis, but who is a first time luxury car buyer comparing the two.	1
	that's what lexus needs to worry about.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2753#msg2753re: price gouging [koury]         that's what lexus needs to worry about.	1
	not really, because from what you've said:                                ' i'd love to buy a lexus for all the obvious reasons, but there's no way i'll pay what they're asking.'	1
	it doesn't look like you'll be buying a lexus with or without the genesis, so to lexus you are not even one of its 'potential first time customer'.	1
	however, it's another story if a buyer who has his heart set dead on the gs but once he found out about the genesis he quickly jumped ship.	1
	that's what lexus has to worry about.	1
	lexus also has to worry about how many of its current owners are willing to trade in their gs/es/ls for a genesis.	1
	like i boldly stated, i personally don't think that number will be anywhere close being significant.	1
	the potential genesis buyers, imo, are more of the 'upgrade customers'.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2755#msg2755re: price gouging [louiswei]        it is short-sided to only look at the purchase cost of a car when considering the overall economics of ownership.	1
	you also have to look at the disposal cost.	1
	historically - and according to edmund's own data - lexus, for example, retains a much higher percentage of it's original cost when it comes to to sell or trade compared to hyundai.	1
	no one really knows how well the value of the genesis will hold up over time.	1
	hopefully, it will be better than hyundai in general.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2760#msg2760great review - but how are the dealers?	1
	the new genesis sounds like a really wonderful car.	1
	however i keep thinking of the vw phaeton.	1
	it too was a wonderful car.	1
	while the genesis doesn't aim as high in the luxury stratosphere as the phaeton did, i think that they are going to share the two of the same problems:                                1. hyundai doesn't have a reputation of making luxury cars.	1
	i know this is obvious, but it's going to be a problem for them in attracting buyers who view themselves as upwardly mobile.	1
	the huyndai is a thrifty man's luxury car; a car for the guy who prefers buffets to cafes.	1
	it's going to be hard to impress your friends more with a hyundai than with a mercedes, no matter how nice the hyundai leather is.	1
	2. the japanese had to build separate dealerships (acura/lexus/infiniti) to allow them to give luxury-level customer service.	1
	vw didn't do that, and thus didn't manage to give its luxury customers the service they expect.	1
	bmw  has personal service advisors who greet their clients by name.	1
	the advisors give free bmw loaners during service; and offer pastries and coffee to waiting patrons.	1
	every car is washed before it's returned to the customer.	1
	is hyundai going to be able to pamper its new customers enough to keep any conquests from the current luxury brands?	1
	i don't believe that they can.	1
	a great steak taken from the buffet may be just as delicious as the one delivered to your table by your french waiter, but once you're used to being waited on, you stop being willing to wait in the line at the buffet just to save a few bucks.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2761#msg2761re: price gouging [hoopla1991]         which will still be worth 80% of what i paid for it in two years                                perhaps with the exception of exotics, which actually appreciates in value, the mass vehicles are depreciating assets, especially in the luxury segement, where they'd drop like rocks.	1
	if you can find a luxury mainstream car that somehow retains 80% of its value after two years, i am writing a check right now                                maybe this headline may have you re-think about your statement/theory: alg has predicted the genesis v8 with higher residual value than bmw 550i, lexus gs460, infiniti m45, mercedes-benz e550 after three years; similarly on the v6, although slightly better.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2762#msg2762re: great review - but how are the dealers?	1
	[lokki]        funny you should bring up the phaeton, and interestingly enough, the genesis has already sold, in a little over a month, 1/5 of the total phaetons sold during the entire us run.	1
	remember, all this with just a little over a month, no full supply, no advertising (with the exception of the tour), etc etc  it also has eclipsed the rl, for example, during the month of july.	1
	if the genesis becomes a failed product in the us, then, and if nothing else, it would have no doubt solidified the rest of the vehicle lineup and overall image.	1
	actually, it has already.	1
	the intangible benefits of the genesis (and forthcoming genesis coupe) is something hyundai can count on for years to come.	1
	by the way, if steak at both locations taste the same, then i would pick the steak from the buffet line.	1
	i've found generally it takes longer waiting for someone to service your hungry stomach, than getting it yourself                to be fair, however, it's not like many buffet lines have steak in the first place        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2763#msg2763re: great review - but how are the dealers?	1
	[lokki]        i don't understand why people bring up the phaeton case while talking about the genesis.	1
	i know the genesis has in common with the phaeton in some aspects-rwd, full-sized, newly-launched luxurious car.	1
	but that's all.	1
	a huge gap between the two still exists- price tag and the value each bears.	1
	simply speaking, the phaeton was overpriced and the genesis is underpriced.	1
	thus the value each brings to you is significantly different.	1
	the phaeton buyers shoud pay as much as mb or bimmer buyers to get no bmw or mb-ish luxo image car.	1
	on the other hand, the gunesis buyers pay 10k~30k less for less luxo image and the same level of driving performance.	1
	then, the genesis buyers can justify their purchase being 'fair' not like the phaeton buyers.	1
	in result, imo, the genesis is likely to sell (way)better than the phaeton       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2764#msg2764re: new full edmunds review of genesis [viking967]        can anyone explain why 0-60 mph test figures slightly vary from reviewer to reviewer?	1
	edmunds claimed 5.9 while motor trend did 5.5 (both for v8).	1
	i think 0.4s difference is not small enough to be negligible.	1
	they have the same results for the v6, though.	1
	any ideas?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2765#msg2765re: new full edmunds review of genesis [yohanc]        several factors that may affect the result of the test are as below...                                - driver's skill (not that much for manual transmission..)                - tires                - the road condition (wet or dry.. )                - the direction and the velocity of the wind while testing (against or before)                - car condition (new or substantial mileage before testing)                                and more to add ?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2766#msg2766re: great review - but how are the dealers?	1
	[allthatblue]        it's a way for them to justify the failure of the genesis, in their predictions, after only a little over a month of retail sale.	1
	one small correction - the phaeton is/was fwd  4wd but i do agree with you on your points.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2767#msg2767re: new full edmunds review of genesis [yohanc]        i've also heard that some reviewers use a '1 foot rolling start' while others use a standing start for their tests.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2768#msg2768re: price gouging [louiswei]        tuned down, tuned up...it doesn't matter...my point is that the genesis 4.6 is better matched against the ls460 rather than the gs460.	1
	that was the point of my comparison.	1
	the 2gr is truly a better engine, no doubt about that and no argument there, but hyundai's 3.8 isn't too far behind.	1
	the gs is much more sporty than the genesis, trust me...the handling is a bit tighter in the gs as compared to that of the sl.	1

	[lokki]        the problem with the phaeton was the huge price gap between it and the passat.	1
	top of the line, fully loaded passat was going for under $40k, the phaeton started                $65k.	1
	at least with the genesis, you don't have that huge price gap that doesn't make sense.	1
	actually...vw does have a luxury brand, it's called audi.	1

	well, you have two questions here really.	1
	one is easy to answer, the other will be a little tougher.	1
	#1, i think that you can buy the genesis right now for under msrp.	1
	of course it depends on where you are and how the supply chain is running, but i think that if you walk into a dealership and make them an offer that is $500-$1000 over invoice (which would be $1200-$1700 off msrp) on a genesis that most dealers will strongly consider selling at that.	1
	i know i would.	1
	now, that is not to say that every store will be that way.	1
	it's a free country.	1
	but, i think you can make that deal whenever you get ready without too much trouble.	1
	question #2. i would be really shooting in the dark as far as the lease situation goes.	1
	you have a few factors here that make the crystal ball get a little cloudy.	1
	when the new year rolls around hma and hmfc will need to be looking at how genesis sales are going.	1
	if things are strong, then the lease residulas will remain high and you will still be able to get a great lease rate.	1
	however, if there are hundreds or thousands or genesi sitting on the ground and collecting dust, then there may be a thought of lowering the residual and you may have a higher rate.	1
	also, of course, interest rates in general make this a gamble.	1
	lastly, who knows how much of this lease special is part of the car's launch?	1
	when things get settled, if there is a good turn rate on this car, hma may not see any need to subsidize it's sales.	1
	it's a crap shoot.	1
	by the way, the v6 test posted yesterday was really awesome!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2778#msg2778re: price gouging [allmet33]         my point is that the genesis 4.6 is better matched against the ls460 rather than the gs460.	1
	you can't compare the engine without comparing the car...                                 the gs is much more sporty than the genesis, trust me...                                i couldn't find the test numbers for the gs350 so i'll use edmund's gs450h numbers just to make a point:                                slalom (mph): 63.5                                also from edmunds for the genesis:                                slalom (mph): 62.8                                sure the gs350 is a bit lighter than the gs450h so another mph or so on the slalom number is expected.	1
	but still, i wouldn't say the gs is 'much' more sportier than the genesis with a merely 2 mph advantage.	1
	maybe you were thinking the is?	1
	leasing a 3-series still ties them to premium gas.	1
	exactly!	1
	so those who 'leased' the 3-series are more likely to feel the rising gas price than those who 'bought' a ls/s/7.	1
	also, in my neighborhood the difference between premium and regular is 16 cents per gallon.	1
	to me that's $2.24 per fill up and since i fill up about once a week that's about $120 per year.	1
	really a moot point in my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2779#msg2779re: price gouging [louiswei]         you can't compare the engine without comparing the car...                                okay...the gs doesn't have the luxury appointments on the interior like the ls and the genesis do...again, i say the gs is geared more toward luxury sport.	1
	in all honesty if you want to compare options and amenities...the genesis compares more favorably to the ls.	1
	i'm sorry if you don't care to believe it, but it's the truth.	1
	don't get me wrong, the ls has a few things the genesis doesn't, but not too many.	1
	no...the is really is a full out sport sedan.	1
	as far as the last statement...you truly missed my point.	1
	you have quite a few folks out here that want to get away from having to put premium fuel in their tanks.	1
	i think it would affect those that spend more time on the road...like me.	1
	i fill up on avarage, about 2 times a week and maybe 2 more times during the weekend (depending on what's going on), so my savings on fuel is quite a bit more significant than yours.	1
	as the difference between regular and premium is 40 cents.	1
	we've got a few stations pumping regular out at $3.79 and premium at $4.19.       	1

	maybe the genesis will sell better in your neck of woods than mine then...                                you might be right, however...i think the better selling model will be the 3.8 w/premium plus to be honest.	1
	i think the 4.6 will sell for those that just feel they need to be able to say they have a car with 368/375 hp (depending on fuel type).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2784#msg2784re: price gouging [allmet33]         however, even at almost identical offerings, the gs w/v-6 starts where the genesis v-8 ends in pricing.	1
	you are not going to get an argument from me on that.	1

	maybe i am spoiled by my is...                                i will go test drive a genesis one of these days and i'll get back to you on that one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2787#msg2787re: price gouging [louiswei]        well...if the genesis can keep up with the gs, that's still a damn good feat considering we are talking hyundai.	1
	i think your is being lighter is much more fun to throw into corners and such, so you could be right.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2789#msg2789re: price gouging [dueho]        the biggest advantage the genesis has over the gs...interior volume.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2790#msg2790re: price gouging [allmet33]        'it was said ealier...ls size, gs handling  ride (open for debate) all at an is price.'	1
	no argument from this corner either!	1
	this is how i look at it: if i were on the market for a gs, i would pause and give the genesis a look.	1
	if i were on the market for an ls, i would drive right by a hyundai dealership not knowing it's there.	1
	let's keep this in perspective:  hyundai created the genesis to compete in the entry-mid level luxury market (and to raise brand awareness).	1
	i'd say they did a good job at it, though you can tell they cut corners here and there (to keep cost down).	1
	the genesis was not meant to compete in the ls, s, 7 class.	1
	that job falls to the vi (if, let's hope, they decide to bring it here).	1
	let's focus on genesis vs gs, m, 5, and e.  that's where the fight is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2791#msg2791re: price gouging [allmet33]        in terms of handling, i would rate the following:                                gs  genesis  5 series    5er is fhe firmest of all, the genesis is somewhere in between (balanced), and the gs is the softest.	1
	before anyone gang up on me, i just would like to point out that there is othing wrong with any of the three in terms of the handling.	1
	certain individuals like the feel one way, while others like it another way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2792#msg2792re: price gouging [dueho]        i can't argue at all with your posting dueho, not at all.	1
	like i've said all along, the fact that hyundai has a car that can be mentioned with the premium makes at all...says a lot for the brand.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2793#msg2793re: price gouging [louiswei]        lou, you really should drive the genesis.	1
	i did and i was impressed by it.	1
	it is not a lexus ls,  but i would certainly take one over an es and it would be nip and tuck with the gs.	1
	an amazing car and i might actually buy one some day.	1
	i would be very curious as to your impressions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2794#msg2794re: finally test drove genesis [ljf]        after driving my new genesis v6 with the 17 inch wheels since monday, i can say that it has a refined ride, however it is not 'soft'.	1
	if you want to ooze down the highway (btw, nothing wrong with that), then the genesis isn't for you.	1
	if the genesis was a pair of shoes, it would be a really nice pair of nike air jordons (that you can get for 50% off).	1
	they are comfy, but they definitely have a sport flavor to them.	1

	let's not drag the es into this.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2798#msg2798re: great review - but how are the dealers?	1
	[allmet33]        have had hyundai's since 2002, now in 2007 azera ltd.  my dealer, arapahoe hyundai, has always washed the car upon its return, even if just changing the synthetic oil, which i brought to the shop.	1
	and, although it was only necessary once for a 1/2 a day, they gave me a hyundai loaner (new santa fe).	1
	sorry  no cookies, but they did have coffee.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2799#msg2799iphone        well, i got the special cable to connect an ipod to the genesis with the tech package a little while ago.	1
	the best i can figure it is for an ipod not the iphone.	1
	when i plug it in i get a message on the phone that the cable is not to be used with the phone.	1
	has anyone gotten either an iphone or an ipod, for that matter, to work successfully with their genesis?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2800#msg2800genesis - longterm reliability?	1
	hyundai has in the past several years scored high in short-term reliability for many of its vehicles.	1
	probably my biggest concern would be long-term reliability since i keep cars for at least the length of the loan (which would be 6 years in this case).	1
	unfortunately there is no long-term data out on the genesis yet, so i suppose there is some risk purchasing this early in the production cycle.	1
	my experience with my an 06 sonata has been good so far as i've had no problems, but that vehicle only has 30k miles on it.	1
	most auto manufacturers can make a vehicle reliable for the first couple years, but what about 5 years down the road at 75,000+ miles?	1
	hyundai's 10yr/100,000 powertrain warranty sounds good, but it is advertised as a 'limited' warranty, so i would guess the coverage is at the dearships discretion.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2801#msg2801re: genesis - longterm reliability?	1
	[bman900]        if i were to keep a car that long for a car without prior history, i'd get extended warranty.	1

	[tom17]        i just visited a hyundai dealership in orlando, fl tonight and asked the same question.... according to the sales manager i talked to their dealership wouldn't be getting a pearl white genesis until nov/dec 2008.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2805#msg2805re: pearl white color ???	1
	[tom17]         is this the first model that hyundai has ever offered with pearl white?	1
	no, but it's a different paint process if that's where you are thinking.	1

	at least not by my standard, or from hyundai models and alike.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2806#msg2806re: finally test drove genesis [sthede]        sthede, thank you for your update on how your genesis feels after a week.	1
	when i said i wanted a soft ride, i don't want to 'float' in undulating waves down the  road, but i like the way the cadillac takes the bone jarring out of road joints, etc.	1
	if the genesis does that, it would be fine for me.	1
	on my short 15 min ride, i did not feel that the genesis rode harsh or had any jarring action on pavement joints.	1
	what i don't want is a transfer of all the little imperfections of the road transmitted thru the steering wheel or the body/seat.	1
	i want some sort of damping to the road, but not neccessarily complete isolation.	1
	if i do buy or lease,  i think that i can live with the premium package.	1
	when i need gps, i have a garmin i can use, and i don't think the parking sensors and turning headlights are worth all that extra money.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2807#msg2807re: pearl white color ???	1
	[bman900]        pearl white genesi should be arriving within the month.	1
	at least that is what i have been told by my factory rep.                                november or december?	1
	lets hope that was just another 'please buy something today' speech.	1
	as far as the 'limited' in the limited warranty is concerned, the comment earlier was a little off base.	1
	the dealership itself actually has almost no say as to whether something is covered by the factory warranty.	1
	hma (or any other mfr) would be the one that would write the guidelines as to what is covered and what is not.	1
	all hyundai models also come with a 'warranty handbook' that is located within the owener's manual packet.	1
	if you have any questions as what what is or isn't covered, be sure to take a close look at this material.	1
	it actually lists all of the parts that are covered in both the powertrain warranty and the other coverages, including the b-b warranty.	1
	the 'limited' notation is to limit the mfrs exposure to defects only.	1
	they do not want to be on the hook for replacing an engine when you didn't change the oil for 50,000 miles.	1
	hma does offer a 120mo/100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper coverage for all models, including genesis.	1
	prices will be set by each dealer, but if you are concerned about long term relaibility (which i think/hope is becoming less and less of an issue) then it may be a worthy investment if for no other reason than a good night's sleep.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2808#msg2808re: finally test drove genesis [ljf]        i can speak to your ride concern, since i had the same prior to buying my genesis.	1
	i had driven an '08 cts and an '07 sts.	1
	the sts is closer to the ride than the cts, which is much firmer and did indeed 'transfer.	1
	.	1
	.all the little imperfections in the road' to some degree.	1
	the sts masks most of those minor imperfections, but really thumps on the big ones.	1
	my genesis absorbs all the little ones, and really only significant pavement separations are felt to any noticeable degree.	1
	i have the premium pkg.	1
	(17' wheels) and the ride is just about perfect for my 55 year-old bones.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2809#msg2809re: finally test drove genesis [lakerunner4h]        lakerunner4h, thanks for your input on the genesis ride vs the cts  sts.	1
	i think i will go back and try to get a longer ride to verify what i felt on the first short ride and what you have also experienced longer term.	1
	did you pay sticker price?	1
	i am in no hurry to buy the genesis or any other car at this time, so i may wait till there is more supply to allow a lower price.	1
	but i think a month or two might be a good time.       	1

	all 4 said the base was 399 monthly but 619 to 629 monthly for the tech.	1
	2 dealers finally came down to the 499, but one dealer did not have a color i liked.	1
	when i settled on my car, i decided to go with 15k miles/year, so that changed the numbers.	1
	i thought it should have been in the 515 to 520 range, but i settled for 525 + tax.	1
	the residual for 15k is 65%.	1
	there are lots of great cars one can lease for 525, but for now, i am quite happy with the genesis.	1
	the nav can be adjusted while driving, something i liked in my 2006 rl.	1
	i am inclined to rate the acura and the genesis nav systems close, with the edge going to the genesis due to a nicer interface and quicker response time.	1
	my company car is a camry hybrid with a smooth/soft ride.	1
	the genesis has a firmer ride, but it is quite acceptable.	1
	the steering feels quite good, and although i cannot compare directly to the audi a6 i drive when in germany due to substantial differences in the roads there as compared to south florida, i bet the genesis would do quite well on the autobahn.	1

	now that i have played a bit more with the nav, the voice recognition is amazingly accurate compared to the 2006 rl.	1
	the ipod cable gives the best level of integration for $29.95 (:except rick case charges $35 for it, did not ask if there was a dealer prep fee on the cable;) i have seen.	1
	i have an iphone 3g, and when you first plug the cable in, it says that this device is not compatible and wants you to turn airplane mode.	1
	i just ignore that message and start using the ipod part of my iphone through the tech package interface.	1
	the bluetooth interface takes care of the phone part of the iphone.	1
	one nice touch is that the steering wheel buttons give you an additional level of control when you keep them pressed for over a second.	1
	such as you can go to the next song by pressing the  button, but if you keep it pressed, it will fast forward the song.	1
	this is great for audio books.	1
	as far as the xm radio goes, the genesis is one of the best out there (the best i've seen).	1
	the tech package button, allows you to quickly tune into any channel, there are 16 presets that you can control from the steering wheel with the  button, and you can step through channels by keeping that button pressed about a second (0.8 as per the manual).	1
	i did have a problem with my windows fogging up on a warm, humid florida night and was a bit concerned.	1
	the reason this happened was that the battery had become discharged at the dealer.	1
	the manual says on page 7-28 that if this happens, a lot of the systems need to be reset, amongst them, the auto defogging logic system.	1
	i followed the procedure in the manual and it works great.	1
	the rain sensing wipers work very good, as do the hid turning lamps.	1
	one thing i really like is that you have the option of allowing both side mirrors tilt down when in reverse.	1
	that, combined with the camera and the proximity warning system sound (you must activate it by pushing in a switch on the left side of the dashboard), makes it a breeze to squeeze into any tight spots.	1
	other than having to deal with the dealers, the genesis is so far, the best car overall i've had.       	1

	one rick case manager at a store told me about the 499 on the tech as i was leaving the dealership.	1
	the other rick case store in davie says there is no such lease.	1
	at doral hyundai, i have a personal friend in the internet department.	1
	his manager would not go below 619 on the lease.	1
	the next day, as i am signing the lease at coconut creek hyundai, i get a call from that manager, telling me he is ready to do the deal (i had driven an hour the day before to get to his store) because he had talked to my friend and he did not realize i was serious about buying a car.	1
	i am serious about not buying a car from  him!       	1

	this is my second lease ever, and the finance guy at coconut creek, managed to scam me, by charging 399 for gap, which is included in hfmc leases.	1
	what happened is that the lease they make you sign has king (the owner of coconut creek) written on the papers, and the fine print on the back says that if you do not purchase gap and it is not spelled out in item 11 on the front, you have no gap coverage.	1
	then, he made my wife sign an anti-theft protection paper, with the cost amount blank.	1
	i went back, had him fill in the amount ($399) and i will now cancel that coverage, as it turns out, the lease is through hmfc.	1
	for that particular finance manager, i would call the place coconut crook, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt (yeah, right... he lied to my face!)	1
	and forgive his mistake as being 'new'.	1
	the rest of the staff were where professional though, and you should simply deal with caution, but by no means avoid them, you can get a deal there maybe.	1
	just beware of the finance guy if he is 'new'...       	1

	does the genesis display the entire artist  song name like the xm only receivers?	1

	'that, combined with the camera and the proximity warning system sound (you must activate it by pushing in a switch on the left side of the dashboard), makes it a breeze to squeeze into any tight spots.'	1

	there's also a visual cue that shows front, back and the 4 corners of the car with 1,2 or 3 lines that match the audible beeps.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2826#msg2826re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [readyformyrl]        based on my time with the navigation system in the genesis, i thought it was intuitive and very user-friendly.	1
	the comparison has been drawn to bmw's idrive, and i would say just like to say this is what the idrive should have been in the first place; audi's mmi comes to mind as to how good i thought the system in the genesis was.       	1

	since the v8's haven't landed yet, do any of you v6 owners wish you had waited for the 4.6?	1
	in my case, being in south florida where the highest elevation is less than 20 feet above sea level and the top speed limit is around 75 mph, i would have chosen the 3.8 anyway.	1
	but for only 2k more, you get a lot of extra features for a small compromise on mpgs.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2829#msg2829audi  a6        watching the opening of the olympics the other evening i say a great commercial by audi on the a4.	1
	(its on the audi web site) my wife and two boys went to a audi dealer, drove the a6 and found the salesperson to be very knowledgeable and professional.	1
	they loved the car and with $2,500 cash back and .9% interest we are seriously considering.	1
	so i just thought i would get my 2 cents in since i have see no discussions about the audi a6.	1
	sure wish the genesis v8 would get here       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2830#msg2830re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [mn778]        the only regret i have about getting the v6 (and its a small one), is that i already had this engine in my azera.	1
	so i kind of feel like i have experienced it already.	1
	this engine does have more hp, and the transmission is better, so it's almost not an issue.	1
	when driving the v6, i don't think you will ever encounter a moment when you wish you had more power.	1
	the v6 is quick, quick, quick.	1
	my desire to have the v8 would be more physiological, in it always bugs me a little to not be driving the top end example of a particular model.	1
	the other thing about the v8 is that the engine is suppose to be so advanced.	1
	so it would be cool to have it, just because it's such a jewel.	1
	but hey, the v8 burns more fuel, cost 2k more, and isn't even here yet.	1
	did i mention it's just barely faster?	1
	and almost all the magazines say they would take the v6 over the v8.	1
	the v6 even has a better weight ratio.	1
	heck, even hyundai thinks 80% of people will take the v6 instead of the v8.	1
	the v8 is more about how big your gun is, not really about if you need it... still it would be nice                ...something to upgrade to in a few years...                                yeah, like my sales guy said, in a few years, this car will probably drive itself.	1
	who knows what cool things will come down the pike... how about a blown v8 with awd and laser cruise control?	1
	now we are talkin...  look out merc s55       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2831#msg2831worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	this is not a knock on the genesis because i really do think it has a lot to offer for the price.	1
	so i go to 'glendale hyundai' in southern california to see the car in person.	1
	they have 2, a red one in the showroom and a silver one with black interior outside that has the premium pkg with a msrp of 35k.	1
	also they have an addendum sticker jus to the right with a '10k dealer mark up' yes you read that correctly exactly $9,995 to make the new price $44,995.	1
	so to the test drive, we get in and the salesman says to take a right at the 1st street than a right at the next and than a right at the next.	1
	you got it we got the car up to a speed of maybe 30 mph to go around a small block.	1
	i pull back in and tell the saleman that's it?	1
	he responds that the manager/owner doesn't want a lot of miles on his oh so precious mass produced luxury car.	1
	he than asks me how i liked the car and i told him that i will pass.	1
	now this dealership is also surrounded by bmw, lexus, infiniti, mercedes, nissan all were together.	1
	and there was no one else even on their lot as 3pm this afternoon.	1
	this is going to be hyundai's big issue with trying to markee a luxury car.	1
	their service and dealership experience is at the bottom end for lower end cars which is what they are used to.	1
	hyundai are you 'listening' you cannot enter a luxury car market with dealers that have no or little concept of service or customer experience.	1
	you will never compete with lexus, bmw, mercedes or audi for that matter.	1
	but i guess that is why their car is the price that it is.	1
	still a great great product hyundai and i still may pursue with a different dealer but right now i am so turned off that i may not.	1
	hyundai really should have opened new dealers like nissan and toyota did to brand their luxury brands infiniti and lexus.	1
	the genesis is truly a really nice car its too bad their lower end dealership experiences are going to really hurt their sales and yes in a few months this car will be close to invoice price versus the 10k over msrp that this idiot dealer had his at!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2832#msg2832re: just leased a sapphire blue... [sthede]        does the tire monitoring system in the genesis only provide a warning light if a tire is low or does it provide a psi display for all four tires as the                 pontiac g8                does?	1

	that's one way to get their attention!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2835#msg2835re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [sthede]        you may have had the same v-6 in your azera, but it's tuned differently and acts differently as well.	1
	the plus side to already having dealt with the engine is you know it's reliability record, right?	1
	the fuel economy of the v-8 as compared to the v-6 is negligible...we're talking a 1 mpg difference and considering you're talking v-6 vs. v-8...  you can get a 1-2 mpg difference between different v-6's alone.	1
	however, with the $2k more you pay for the fully loaded 4.6...to me it's worth it over the $40k for the 3.8 w/tech package.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2836#msg2836re: finally test drove genesis [lakerunner4h]        lakerunner4h, thanks for the info on what you paid.	1

	the cabin is well done with a nice lux feel to it.	1
	car handles very nice and imho the v6 engine is plenty of power, i never felt like i needed more power.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2838#msg2838re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[tjones39]        tjones39,                                was the $44,995 price tag for a 3.8 with only the premium package?	1
	that seems very high.	1
	i visited several dealers in the orlando, fl area and each one had loaded 3.8 genesis models with all option packages (premium, premium plus, and technology package) for $40,000 as the final sticker price.	1
	i assume the '10k dealer mark up' you saw is similiar to 'adjusted market value' which dealers tend to add to vehicles in more affluent areas of the country, which im sure southern ca is no excpetion.	1
	i recall this tactic that dealers used when i lived in the wash dc area.	1
	of course the first thing i would do during negotiations was cross that line item right off the price, then start from there                .	1
	i am actually considering waiting several months until the initial hype slows down and dealerships get more inventory.	1
	hopefully the increased suply will lower demand and give consumers more leverage.	1
	good luck.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2839#msg2839re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [allmet33]        on paper, the fuel economy of the v6 vs. the v8 was very close -- within a mile per gallon.	1
	however, on reviews i have read, the the difference was much more pronounced -- up to 4 mpg difference.	1
	if i remember correctly, one reviewer who drove the v6 on the loop got a little over 20 mpg average but only 16 mpg average with the v8.	1
	so, i think we'll need to get some 'real world' figures before we can really make a determination of gas mileage.	1
	i drive the v6 (azera version) and i get a very good 30 mpg on the highway but a very poor 15 mpg in the city.	1
	in fact in stop and go traffic i will even get down to 12 to 13 mpg.	1
	my vw passat v6 never dropped below about 18 mpg city.	1
	i was somewhat disappointed in the azera's city mpg.	1
	the genesis has the same engine as my azera -- only finer tuned, so i would predict similar -- maybe sightly better -- results.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2840#msg2840re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [ricwhite]        i just filled up for the first time.	1
	had 378 miles and topped off at 15.6 gallons.	1
	that is 24.2 mpg with about 70% hwy driving, the rest in stop and go traffic.	1
	my 06 rl averaged 21 mpg for this kind of driving.	1
	my wife's 07 camry hybrid does 33 mpg on a tankful...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2841#msg2841re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[tjones39]        i test drove one and had it out on the highway and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the genesis.	1
	however, my dealer(i own an 06 sonata lx6 and an 06 azera limited) has also added a dealer markup of $ 5,995. i told the sales manager that it is out and out gouging.	1
	spoke to my service manager and he agreed.	1
	in about a year or so the car will be discounted because i do not see a marketing effort and in any case when they jack the price up to around $40,000.	1
	and higher the 'red carpet' customers will pass.	1

	[drdonrs]        hello all,                yes the $44,995 price was the 'adjusted market value of $9,995' hilarious.	1
	and yes it was for the 3.8 v6 with premium pkg only that carries a $35,000 msrp exactly.	1
	i will post in the section our host suggested also for dealers.	1
	i would 'strongly' suggest anyone in southern california not deal with glendale hyundai!!!	1

	anyone else concerned about driving rwd genesis in the northeast, or is the concern minute, unless i'm in snow?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2844#msg2844re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [readyformyrl]        i do not have any concerns about driving the genesis in snow.	1
	i have driven a jaguar s-type v8 in snow for 3 years, and a chysler 300c hemi rear-wheel drive in snow for 2 years, both did just fine because of stability control.	1
	without it, the s-type would be useless.	1
	btw, i live in minnesota... so i have had plenty of experiences driving rear-wheel drive in snow.	1
	if you go to the hyundai genesis website, and watch all the little animations, they specifically mention that they believe rear-wheel drive is better in snow than front wheel drive.	1
	with a nearly perfect 52/48 front to back weight ratio, latest gen stability control, and quality all-season tires, the genesis should be able to get through a snowy day no problem.	1
	by the way, i looked up the tires for the v6, they were rated as 'good' in the snow by customers at the tirerack.com website.	1
	the genesis v6 comes with dunlop sp sport 5000 sport symmetrical tires (#15 on the list), here is a link to the comparison page:                                 http://www.tirerack.com/tires/surveyresults/surveydisplay.jsp?type=uhpas        	1

	that's one reason why i won't lease.	1
	when i go into the market, it's at a time of my choosing.	1
	you'll almost certainly pay more for this car now than you will next winter.	1
	anyway, i wouldn't worry about driving the genesis in this part of the country.	1
	i live on long island, just east of nyc, and i can recall only one day this past winter when traction was problematic.	1
	even then, a rwd car equipped with good snow tires would have had no trouble getting around.	1
	and as a bmw owner, i can tell you that rwd is the most satisfying drive train configuration on dry roads.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2846#msg2846re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [sthede]        the dunlop tire used on the v6 is the sp sport 5000 'm' which is not a highly rated tire on any surface, let alone snow.	1
	they are #19 on a list of 21. in the tire world they are considered crap!	1
	does anyone know what tire is stock on the v8?	1
	i certainly hope they are not dunlop's.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2847#msg2847re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [ricwhite]        ricwhite...even if the difference is 4 mpg, that's not a huge difference considering it's a v-6 vs. v-8.	1
	the differences that folks are posting are going to vary since everyone drives differently and under varying conditions.	1
	like you, i see close to the same numbers in fe with my azera as well.	1
	the 15 mpg city i average is really because i'm heavy footed.	1
	i made an effort to drive 'gently' for a week and saw the fe actually go up to almost 17 mpg.	1
	i won't say the azera is the perfect city car, but it's better than the the the suv we own.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2848#msg2848re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [allmet33]        i know people are freaked out about gas, but, if you step back for a minute, we're not talking about a substantial amount of money here....if you drive 12k miles per year, that's 600 gallons of gas at 24 mpg and 500 gallons of gas at 20 mpg...                                so... we're talking 100 more gallons of gas a year which is $500 (~$40 / month).	1
	not a big deal to someone buying a $40k car....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2849#msg2849re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [ahah]        those numbers work for those that simply drive 12k miles a year, but i am one that drives on average between 25-30k per year.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2850#msg2850re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [ahah]        all fuel economy estimates and results are now suspect due to ethanol.	1
	10% ethanol/90%gasoline lowers mpg by 5-10% depending upon who did the research and report.	1
	e85 lowers it as much as 25%.	1
	if i use cruise on relatively level roads and drive 55, i can get 32 mpg in my azera.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2851#msg2851re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[drdonrs]        my dealer has been pretty good re: my azera, but the only issue has been the shocks and that is above their level.	1
	they show one genesis on the lot asking msrp.	1
	another dealer in this area called me last thursday and said he had a genesis on the lot, but it would probably be gone by saturday.	1
	today is tuesday and it is still there asking msrp.	1
	the first one they got did sell in one day and the 5 lincoln mks' all sold within a week.	1
	per salesman all sold at msrp.	1
	with the econonmy and other issues, i expect we will see genesis v6's with $2,000 discounts by early 2009.                hyundai does not need another dealer network, just improve the ones it has, upgrade service, etc.	1
	adding another dealer network to market genesis would cost billions which would be passed on to the customers, even if you add azera and veracruz to the 'make.'	1
	the lexus dealer charges $70.00 for an oil and filter change and provides you with a  loaner.	1
	the toyota dealer charges 29.95 for the same service.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2852#msg2852re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [carolinabob]        the hit from ethanol is closer to 10% with my 300c hemi and 330i (based on long trips down i-95).	1
	it's hard to tell, but i think the ethanol prevents the 300c from switching to 4 cylinders around 70 mph.	1
	this may also affect the genesis v8 cylinder deactivation.	1
	the whole state of florida is switching to 10%/90% and i can no longer find real gas in my county.	1
	(note that ethanol can also dissolve the fuel lines in 2-cycle yard equipment, and can destroy built-in fuel tanks of older boats.)	1

	[tjones39]        not to excuse your socal dealer - but to be fair - any and all car dealers are not generally required to sell any car for any given price - they will get what they can get for any car.	1
	perhaps you remember the mini cooper when it first came out - similar 'market adjustments' to what you are talking about here the honda fit carries a $1500.00 'adjustment' here in houston right now - on a $15000.00 car!.	1
	i remember the infiniti m selling at $5k over sticker a few years back.	1
	any dealer will do the same thing as this hyundai dealer is doing - if they can get it - and if they can that would be a good thing for not only genesis buyers (resale values) but also hyundai (maybe they have finally have a car that doesn't have to discounted heavily to be sold).	1
	i would bet you that other hyundai dealers in your area are doing the same thing - such is the nature of competition (and supply/demand).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2854#msg2854re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[captain2]         i would bet you that other hyundai dealers in your area are doing the same thing                                i don't know.... the dealer i went to in southern nj seemed willing to deal if i was.	1
	(i explained i wouldn't be buying until my current lease was up)  there were no market adjustments on the sticker and they had four units and had only sold 1 so far.	1
	now, maybe 'willing to deal' was msrp but that didn't seem to be the case.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2855#msg2855re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[tjc78]        one of the oddities of car shopping - the same car can (and will) be priced differently in different parts of the country.	1
	i do find it hard to believe that any dealer thinks they are going to get $45k for a hyundai of any sort ( think hyundai made a good decision in not identifying the car as what it is)  - never mind the $35k that's actually on the window sticker  - but socal is the land of the $5k house payment                so maybe not that surprising.	1
	judging by your report as well as several others here, this buyer would be well served to look elsewhere                remember too many years ago (mid 70s) when i wanted to buy the hot car at the time (something called an 'accord') - dealers were getting several hundred  over sticker - i was poed and even went so far as 'reporting' it to honda hdqtrs.	1
	in calif.. to no avail, of course ,and ended up in something else.	1
	it's really the principal of the whole thing and especially hard to accept on a car that you would expect a big discount on but it does happen all the time....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2856#msg2856re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[captain2]        one dealer in mn has discounts posted right on the window (about $1000.00).	1
	i've not heard of anyone around here seeking over sticker.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2863#msg2863re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [goodmove]        i just got off the phone with the dealer who is willing to offer the lease promo deal but mentioned that the total amount due at signing will be 1800+first month (prem.	1
	plus package) + title + tax + document fees ($180).	1
	i am in detroit and not sure why the tax + doc fees are included since i will be paying tax on my monthly lease rentals also.	1

	anyone can help?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2864#msg2864re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [milan13]        i think there's a misunderstanding on the lease terms.	1
	taxes are added to the monthly payment within the lease and are usually not paid in a lump sum up front.	1
	other than that, i think the other terms appear about right.	1
	i'm not that knowledgeable about the advertised lease deal, but i think it included down payment around the $1500 point (you stated $1800) plus the first month's lease (which is typical) plus title and document fees (although i usually figure anything over $150 is gouging).	1
	so, it appears like it's legit.	1
	you just need to make sure the residual amount is correct and the money factor is right.	1
	with taxes, you would probably end up paying about $35/month more than the advertised amount:  so a $349/mo lease, for example, will probably end up around $385/mo after taxes.	1
	anything more than that and there's something fishy gone and you'll have to dig through the numbers and paperwork to figure out where.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2865#msg2865lease numbers on tech package        i was given these lease numbers for 40k tech v6:                                $39500 price                $2000 cap reduction                $595 acquisition                lease factor 0.00080                tax $895.44                mv fees $170                doc fees $ 398.50                66% residual                                $3267 down w/24 mos at $548.72                                they said they would be willing to deal, i knew i wouldn't become serious about this car until i looked at some others but i questioned the numbers.	1
	the national program has $2100 + fees and it would be about $499 w/o tax.	1
	does anyone know the purchase price of the car w/the national program for the tech model v6 and what is the invoice on this car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2866#msg2866re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [ricwhite]        that varies by state.	1
	in mn now, for example, sales tax is paid up front for the entire lease term.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2867#msg2867re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [milan13]        leased my 3.8 with premium package a week and a half ago.	1
	i posted the entire deal on this forum, in case you want to compare.	1
	if you are looking at a 3.8 with tech package, obviously that will be more.	1
	but unless something has changed in the last week or so, there is no reason anyone couldn't get a deal close to what i got, which i think was great.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2883#msg2883re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [readyformyrl]        honestly i don't know.	1
	i think it was almost at invoice, maybe a few hundred bucks,                                i had been pricing out leases on all kinds of cars for months.	1
	chysler 300cs, jeep grand cherokees, nissan muranos, subaru legacy limited gts, ford edge limited, lincoln mkz... so i had a pretty good feel on what a lease on a $35,000 car would be.	1
	not to mention this dealership got me a monthly payment $65.00 a month less than their sister store, and with $500 less down, and absorbing two $435 payments i had left on my azera the sister store didn't even consider.	1
	i tossed them the keys to my azera and my credit card for $1500, and they tossed me the keys to my new genesis.	1
	done.	1
	my monthly payments stayed the same as i had been paying for 2 years.	1
	ok, maybe it wasn't that fast, but you get the idea.	1
	i guess i didn't care what the final sale price was, it was a great monthly lease payment compared to everything else i had priced out, they could take my azera off my hands right now, and besides, i had had car fever for months, and it was driving me crazy.	1
	it was time to put me out of my misery, and pull the trigger!	1
	and judging by what other folks have been getting quoted, i actually feel somewhat lucky i got the deal i did.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2884#msg2884re: just leased a sapphire blue/tan tech pack v6 [readyformyrl]         do you feel the genesis is just as responsive upon acceleration as the acura rl and does it handle like the rl when taking corners from your standpoint?	1
	for all practical purposes, i prefer the genesis to the rl.	1
	yes the rl was  a great performer and the awd was reassuring, but here in south florida, i do not see the need for myself to even try to approach the handling limits of the genesis.	1
	the acceleration on the genesis is way smoother than the rl's.	1
	i am really getting to enjoy the lexicon audio system and it's getting to the point that i am looking for any excuse to get into the car and drive somewhere.	1
	the car feels surefooted when i push it on the on and off ramps.	1
	i saw a video on youtube that had the genesis outcornering and outbraking bmw and mb.	1
	what we need to keep in mind is that this is a hyundai, and although not as sophisticated as cars costing 10-20k more, for 90% of driving conditions it's just as good as any car out there.	1
	if an audi a6, the rl and the genesis cost exactly the same, i would pick the a6 first by a tiny margin, genesis second and rl last.	1
	but since the cost is not the same, the genesis wins by a longshot in my book.	1
	now, if i was asked for my choice in germany -if the genesis was available there-  i would easily pay 10k more for the a6, as it really is an amazing car to drive on the autobahn...       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2893#msg2893what's up with these dealers?	1
	today i test drove the genesis 6v for the first time and was totaly impressed.	1
	i would rank the vehicle up there with any of the cars in the class.	1
	unfortunately, there were no cars available to drive with the navi option.	1
	upon returning to the dealership ( brad benson, new jersey) i had a chance to look more carefully at the window sticker and was amazed to find a ' price adjustment' of $ 5,000.  the salesman seemed not to find this unusual, and even told me i should be grateful, since he had heard that other dealers were charging even more !	1
	the 35k sticker was now 40k ( that's without navi, which i am told would add 5k to the car).	1
	i walked out after being told that the lease would be in the $ 650 range.	1
	hyundai had better rein in these dealers or they will miss a golden chance...... ed       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2894#msg2894re: what's up with these dealers?	1
	[bluechip1954]        i agree.	1
	i've been saying that all along.	1
	of course, someone's going to complain about what we're saying but i think marking up the price like that is going to turn people off.	1
	it doesn't make since to me to try to enter a luxury market by raising the price of your car by another $5,000.	1
	of course if it was mb, bmw, infiniti, lexus, and audi it may not matter because they are already in the luxury division and people may not mind paying extra for one.	1
	but hyundai is not established in the luxury division yet so raising your price above msrp is not the way to get a foothold into the division.	1
	i think they are too overconfident with the genesis.	1
	then again maybe they are trying to see how many people are foolish enough to pay $5000 over msrp.	1
	of course they know they can always lower the price later.	1
	toyota did the same thing when they launched the tundra.	1
	consequently, many people including me decided to buy other vehicles because they were pricing their tundras too high.	1
	i think they have a winnner with the genesis but their marketing ploy is going to hurt them.	1
	just my opinion.        	1

	not really.	1
	this is not anything new.	1
	in fact, the honda fit, for example, has been selling 20% over its msrp in some areas.	1
	bottom line, if you don't like market adjustments, find another dealer (or wait); if you don't like the dealer, go to another one.	1
	just to be fair,                 every                automaker has sour apples (dealers) on its hands..                                on a completely different subject, it's interesting to note how some people are actually shocked about the fact you can't get much discounts on the genesis (yet), while glow about the amount of discounts one can get on a m35/45, for example.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2898#msg2898maybe hyundai dealerships are getting the message        i visited a hyundai dealership today (in metro atlanta) and saw that the genesis they had previously marked-up $4000 was now selling at msrp not inluding the $399 special paint coating that they added.	1
	i have also noticed that this dealership has not sold any of the 3 genesi it had on the lot.	1
	(two of them are inside the showroom).	1
	maybe they now realize that marking up the price $4000 over msrp is not the way to sell a car.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2899#msg2899hyundai dealerships.	1
	hyundai doesnt have a patent on deception.	1
	its quite rampant in the auto industry.	1
	many dealerships bait their hooks with great deals and when they reel in the customers, the deals suddenly disappear or are drastically changed.	1
	its typical of many dealerships  not just hyundai.	1
	however, i do have to admit that hyundai seems to have a higher percentage of dealerships that are  what i consider to be  all foam and no beer.	1
	im not meaning to offend, but ive been to hyundai, acura, vw and buick dealerships and i would say that it appears to me that those who work at hyundai dealerships are a little lower on the food chain than personnel from other dealerships.	1
	it doesnt give a good first impression to walk into the hyundai dealership and hear the secretary on the phone shouting about an ex-husband and see a sales rep  standing in the corner shoving a burrito into his mouth and the other one sitting on the worn couch with his feet up on the coffee table laughing at something oprah just said on the old television set in the corner.	1
	and the clientele that hyundai attracts aren't much better.	1
	walking into some hyundai dealerships is like walking into a kmart where most of the people seem to have lumbered in from the local homeless shelter.	1
	it seems like everybody there including the employees mustve had a huge celebration when they passed fourth grade.	1
	and then you get to talking to some of the sales reps and you find that they have a few lug nuts rattlin in the hubcaps, if you know what i mean.	1
	one guy i talked to  a very old gentleman  couldnt answer any of my questions and just sat glassy-eyed while another sales rep in the corner answered the questions for him like some kind of weird ventriloquist act from the local circus.	1
	even the best hyundai dealership i found  which had excellent service  felt a little like walking into a wal-mart store.	1
	i think the genesis sounds like an excellent upscale automobile and im certainly considering upgrading my azera; but, i just dread having to drive several hours past all of the awful hyundai dealerships in order to find that one that seems to have their heads screwed on straight and doesn't play the deception games.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2900#msg2900re: maybe hyundai dealerships are getting the message [zone4]        it appears that many hyundai dealerships understand the 'supply' part (which is very low right now), but they don't understand the 'demand' part (which is also fairly low).	1
	marking cars above msrp only makes sense when there is low supply and high demand.	1
	i guess they are realizing that now.	1
	the worry is that hyundai dealerships have sabotaged their one big advantage with the genesis -- price, and have now driven away potential customers.	1
	with the economy the way it is, they need to take any little advantage they can get.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised if in a few months they are discounting the genesis by $2000 off msrp.	1
	we'll see if the advertising blitz planned for this fall increases demand or not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2901#msg2901re: hyundai dealerships.	1
	[ricwhite]        i have an idea:  let's all chip in and pay more for hyundais so dealerships can afford to attract top talent.	1
	maybe they could add a $2000 'recruiting adjustment' to each car, more on the higher-priced cars like the genesis.	1

	this morning when i visited the hyundai dealership there was another customer on the lot but he never looked at the genesis.	1
	i was a little surprised because usually when i look at a genesis other customers do also.	1
	this guy was only looking at accents and sonatas.	1
	maybe he decided not to purchase a genesis because of the mark-ups.	1
	even if he couldn't afford one it seemed strange to me that he wouldn't even look at one considering that the genesis is the best looking hyundai car in my opinion.	1
	heck, everyone has looked at cars on lots that they couldn't or ones that were too pricey.	1
	then again maybe he has seen, driven, sat in, etc.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2906#msg2906re: worst dealer experience ever!!!	1
	[mnjasper]        this is exactly what happens when you have dealers who are used to dealing with people that don't expect a level of service/attitude that comes with a $40,000.00 purchase decision.	1
	please don't take offense at this statement.	1
	but hyundai (generally) sells to people who don't expect this level of service.	1

	i leased a titanium gray w/black interior v-6 tech package from bruce at morrie's hyundai in brookly park.	1
	we agreed on all lease terms over the phone/email and there were no surprises when i picked it up last tuesday.	1
	they even had it trailered up here from cedar rapids at no additional cost since that was the closest dealer with that color (they had to send a black one down there in return).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2910#msg2910houston discover genesis event        i attended the discover genesis event here in houston  got a chance to compare the v8 genesis with a cadillac cts.	1
	gotta say, looks stunning in person  the interior is fantastic.	1
	the fit  finish is miles above the cts or the mb they had on hand.	1
	hyundai has hit a home-run with genesis.	1
	although the v8 had more oomph, personally, i don't think i would go for a v8 as v6 is more than plenty for me.	1
	one thing in which the genesis clearly outshone the cts was in the wet track test.	1
	i knew the technical aspect of traction control system  i knew what it is supposed to do.	1
	but i had never experienced it in action.	1
	the hyundai rep riding shotgun asked me to flood the pedal on the wet track.	1
	i was kinda hesitant as i expected to be forced to control the car with difficulty.	1
	but man, never lost traction for a second!	1
	even when i was flooring it, it moved steadily  maintained traction.	1
	and when i hit the brakes, the abs feedback came on, but never did i feel out of control.	1
	the cts's traction control also came on during the wet track test, but man, it was violent!	1
	cts maintained traction but it told me in no uncertain terms that something dangerous was happening.	1
	genesis traction control  abs wins this hands-down  for not scaring the bejeebers out of drivers when tcs comes on.	1
	to this day i had not realized how much realworld impact these alphabet safety features have in adverse conditions.	1
	i knew what tcs, ebd, esc do, but experiencing them in real world situations was an eye opener.	1
	i would not buy any car without tcs  esc.	1
	no car i or my wife drives would be lacking in these features.	1
	kudos to hyundai for making these features standard on even entry level cars while other manufacturers still say they're 'optional'.	1
	it looks like genesis is going to be on our very very short list when the wifey needs a new car next year!       	1

	[zone4]        regarding my genesis experience at brad benson's hyundai in n.j. , i also had the opportunity to check out the m35x, lexus g and other cars of that class.	1
	i have to say that my time at these dealerships, by and large, was enjoyable and informative.	1
	they were, except audi, prepared to do anything to make a deal and move their metal.	1
	their loan rates were as low as 0.9% for 72 mos... each and every salesperson was knowledgeable about the vehicle i was looking at.	1
	the sales manager at hyundai did not even know the grade of gas the genesis uses !	1
	he was helpful, however, in admitting that hyundai's rate was very high and suggested i take a home equity line  instead... he really said that !	1
	i love the car, but i keep thinking i will have to put up with the hyundai dealer network if i get it....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2916#msg2916money in pocket or pay more for dealer experience        i get the point about how nice it is to have a good slaes experience.	1
	but for me, if it means a 3k lower car price, then so be it.	1
	i 'll complain on the way to costco to buy me 60 inch plasma in my new 3k cheaper genesis.	1
	how much more would the bottom line price for the car be if  hyundai rolled out an extensive training course for all salesmen on service slaesmanship strategy, increased commissions, required better showrooms,  etc, jsut so i can point my pinkie finger up while i drink exotic tea sitting in the luxurius showroom, as my paperwork is prepared and put in a leather holding case?	1
	my recommendation is if a dealer is marking up, negotiate.	1
	if they won't give you a good price, go to the next dealership.	1
	if they have a good price, but the ambiance is poor, and the attitude is poor, just reward yourself later with all the money you save!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2917#msg2917hyundai genesis review        houdini, this one is for you.	1
	the hyundai genesis is without a question one of the most high profile new cars, if not the highest, of the year.	1
	before even getting a chance to drive it and reading the reviews i was positive that this car will bring the hyundai brand to a different level but i still had doubts in my mind.	1
	when the positive reviews starting to come in i was convinced that this car is good, very good as matter of fact, but i was still not a believer.	1
	however, that had all been changed after my test drive today and all i can say is wow!!	1
	this car is so good that in my opinion it deserves nothing short of its own brand, own badge and own dealership network.	1
	followings are my impressions about the car.	1
	exterior:                sleek, inoffensive, and simple.	1
	its not difficult for one to realize that hyundai had incorporated a lot of elements from the competing brands such as lexus, bmw and infiniti when designing the genesis but overall it looks very well executed.	1
	the paint job is top notch with minimal orange peels and all the panels lined up nicely with minimal and luxury car standard gaps.	1
	i still do not like the klingon grille and would prefer the optional 18 wheel to come without the chrome-like finish but those are just nit-picking to be perfectly honest.	1
	interior:                this is really where this car shines, the materials used and fit-and-finish is all top notch and the center stack ergonomics is excellent in my opinion.	1
	the navigation system that comes with the tech package is very user friendly and the interface response time is fast.	1
	personally i still prefer touch-screen over the knob/joystick type of setup but the one in the genesis is definitely something i can live with.	1
	i was pleasantly surprised that the majority of the interior surfaces are rubberized thus provide a high quality, soft-touch feels.	1
	the only part that felt cheap is the top of the center console which is covered with hard plastic material.	1
	the biggest complaint i have about the car is the seats.	1
	first of all the leather quality isnt really up to the luxury car standard and the seats are way too soft with a spongy and bouncy kind of feel.	1
	also, the front seats are very flat, lacking both the side bolster and thigh support.	1
	driving:                overall the car felt confident with a balance ride quality between comfort and performance.	1
	it is no bmw in terms of road feel and handling but it can certainly hold it own against its major competitors.	1
	the steering weight is on the heavy side and that is good for this car.	1
	the only time that the weakness of the chassis shows is when the car is getting pushed to the limitation, for example, during high speed turns.	1
	under those conditions the steering becomes very light and the road feel becomes vague.	1
	in my opinion this is the only time that one will be able to tell why its luxury brand competitors like the 5er, e-class and gs cost at least $10k more.	1
	however, for 95% of the drivers the genesis will serve them just as good as its more expensive foes.	1
	bottom line:                again, wow!!	1
	i am sold.	1
	hyundai is coming, toyota and lexus, you better watch out.	1
	if i am in the market for a large sedan there is no doubt in my mind that this will be the car.	1
	period.       	1

	the mistake was telling me that gap was not included in my lease and i would have to pay $399 for gap coverage.	1
	as it was pointed out by pegasus17 on this forum, gap is supposed to be included.	1
	when i went back, the new guy told me the $399 was for something better than gap, it was for some sort of theft protection coverage i did not request nor wanted.	1
	so, i felt scammed.	1
	typical i thought for car dealers in south florida.	1
	to my surprise, one of the sales managers, anthony morris, offered to correct this, and today, had my wife and i sign new lease papers with the right numbers and cut us a check to refund the $399 i was overcharged.	1
	this to me is significant, because anthony and coconut creek hyundai, did not have to do this, as they already had my signature on the papers with the additional charge.	1
	there are some honest people in this business after all.	1
	both anthony and my salesperson, edeline, have my greatest respect for going the extra mile and making things right.	1
	if you are in south florida and are looking for a place to buy a genesis, give edeline or anthony a call.	1
	you should not miss out on one of the best values for your money.	1
	i do not want to make this sound as a commercial for them, but i believe in the power of word of mouth, and just as i recommend people they  try the macintosh, the iphone, and make my living recommending an promoting nutritional cleansing, i highly recommend the genesis as the premium value car of a lifetime.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2928#msg2928just deliver the car, not a show.	1
	i don't want or need to be pampered.	1
	i don't need to be served a latte`or have my fanny patted.	1
	i don't care if the showroom is adorned in premium trim or if my salesperson is smoother.	1
	when they're smoother they're just more competent at getting their meathooks deeper into my wallet.	1
	frankly, i don't want to have a 'relationship' with my dealer, my salesperson or my service dept.	1
	i'd rather have a relationship with people that aren't just there to make money off me.	1
	let's keep this business and business is just a transaction so let's keep it that way.	1
	and who really wants to hang around a car dealership so what's it matter which one i spend my 2 hours in every 5-7 years?	1
	just get my docs done, my car prep'd and get me out.	1
	if you can't do it in 2 hours, with my own financing, i'll go to the one who can.	1
	don't try make me feel like 'the experience' justifies the overpricing of your brand, just get me the car i have researched and put on your show for the others who need it.	1
	i am just not into the whole prestige and brand thing because it's an intangible that does nothing for my family or me.	1
	i've figured out it's a car and it's  depreciating faster than the washing machine.	1
	and i definitely won't won't even keep it as long anyway.	1
	as far as service, well, i'll only buy a car that's built well enough an only requires fluid changes, brakes and minor stuff the first 100,000, so i don't need your back-end which wants to do all kinds of work on my car that doesn't need to be done at a higher price(you really don't think that latte' is free do ya?)	1
	i've never once had to use a dealerships service dept.	1
	so that won't change.	1
	so, it's really all about the car                .	1
	and the genesis is perfect.	1
	it's solid, well-built, getting rave reviews, modern, attractive, conservatively styled and loaded with the stuff i need.	1
	it's reliable and durable, it's affordable, it mocks the shallowness of materialistic brand snobbery and saves me enough money to buy a good used car for my 16 year old.	1
	just deliver the car, not a show.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2933#msg2933lexus is soooo much sexier        i'm not saying the hyundai isn't a decent car, and maybe it's because most people here are men, but i drove both the genesis and and the lexus gs, and the lexus was much more to my liking.	1
	the interior was dolcegabbana pampering, and the exterior design of the car was very svelte, while the genesis was just generic.	1
	both cars have suspensions that are too firm, imo, though.	1
	that's why we passed on both.	1
	i don't get everyone racing to build firmer and firmer suspension settings.	1
	if we had german quality roads, i could understand.	1
	but we don't.	1
	and we probably never will.	1
	plush rides will prevail again.	1
	big margins to the luxury coach maker that manages to re-realize this.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2934#msg2934re: lexus is soooo much sexier [ksmigel]        which one did you end up choosing, if you don't mind me asking?	1
	i don't think the gs or the genesis was too firm.	1
	looking for firmness?	1
	look no further but the 5 series.	1
	anyway, the setup of the genesis was very balanced, i thought (and many others, including industry professionals has agreed on this); the gs was a little too soft for my likes, but nevertheless a fantastic ride also.	1
	i had the similar feelings on the interior, where i felt the genesis outshined the gs, not by a big margin, however.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2935#msg2935re: lexus is soooo much sexier [joe97]        we haven't yet, joe.	1
	right now, i'm favoring a cadillac sts while my husband is favoring an infiniti g37.	1
	the infiniti g37 is too firm for my tastes, to be honest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2936#msg2936genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease        i suppose i am in a market where there aren't lines of eager genesis buyers, huge mark ups and 15 minute test drive appointments necessary.	1
	to tell you the truth 4 days ago i had never heard of the genesis and tonight i own one!	1
	after casually passing by the dealer i happened to notice a really sharp looking sedan so i stopped, looked, took a short test drive an was very impressed so i did what any other semi interested buyer might do (i guess?)	1
	i asked if i could take for the weekend and try it out.	1
	they agreed.	1
	driving 40 miles home i became more impressed, but skeptical.	1
	after 2 more days i didn't really want to take it back!!	1
	this is an incredible vehicle!	1
	the quietest car i have ever driven (lexus, volvo, infiniti, mb).	1
	exceptional, quick speed, the best v6 i have ever driven.	1
	seat comfort - one of the best again.	1
	very nice quality design on the inside.	1
	i understand the strong urges many in this board may have to compare this sedan with other 'luxury' sedans with a critical eye, but notice even the skeptics suggest this car might not measure up to the lexus, which by itself suggests the genesis is a huge step up from the maxima, avalon and even acura and for the same or a better price.	1
	for those who can't get over the fact that hyundai has built a car out of its league (at least so far) and are concerned by the flying h on the tailgate and conspicuously absent from the nose consider this - there is no other 24 lease out there that even come close!!!	1
	my deal:                genesis 3.8                premium plus package                sterling blue w/cashmere (this color is amazing and unique)                msrp $36,000                sales price $34,438                rebate $500                24 month/12,000 miles                66% residual                .0008 money factor                $299 doc fee's                $595 acquisition                $0 security deposit                $2,199 total out of pocket                $451 + taxes                                a note to all prospective buyers, don't buy, why would you ever buy.	1
	lease this vehicle.	1
	for prospective leasors.	1
	here are the answers many have asked about the lease terms for clarification.	1
	if you are like me and hate to hear answers, from some on this forum, that begin with 'well what my salesman told me is'... hopefully this will bring some clarity.	1
	realize that hyundai is really new to the leasing game (see the numbers above).	1
	when your best selling product is $15,000 you don't need leasing programs.	1
	the sales manager of the dealership i worked with was a very competent guy who had been with the dealership for 10 years and yet really knew nothing about the genesis lease as i was there first genesis lease.	1
	i asked questions that many of us have mused about here - gap insurance, disposition fee, etc.	1
	wanting to be sure to answer accurately he retrieved the dealer flyer from hyundai exclusively for the dealers.	1
	yes i said the spec sheet for the dealers eye's only.	1
	he left it with me as he ran the numbers.	1
	i had about 15 minutes to peruse and here' the straight scoop:                gap is included, do not buy gap                $2,199 minimum out of pocket is required.	1
	as a savvy leasor i always try to lease with $0 down.	1
	this lease does not allow this.	1
	i bet some dealerships may find a way around this but mine stuck right to the details.	1
	$400 lease disposition fee (this is the cost to return the vehicle, even if it is in perfect condition)                24 month/12,000 miles money factor .0008, residual 66% (these hold true whether nav is included or not)                the 36 month lease is no good.	1
	mf .0012 residual 51% (payments were nearly identical to the 24 month term)                dealer makes $150 for selling this lease (good to know during negotiations)                some here have mentioned the dealer adding a theft deterrent system for $379 or $399.	1
	this is a phony dealer markup and my dealer removed it without argument.	1
	without remembering the exact language, there was a particular paragraph that suggested that there was some certain number of leases hyundai would offer then the lease would go away.	1
	it may be just till sept 2, who knows, but don't expect a better lease and you really should not expect another lease of any kind.	1
	hope this helps.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2937#msg2937white genesi        hello gentlemen.	1
	and ladies.	1
	the official word is that white genesi have started production as of last week.	1
	the cars will be on the ground in september.	1
	by the way, i finally got a genesis in stock.	1
	beige with premium package.	1
	i must say that the longer that i look over the car, the more impressed i am .	1
	the interior was very impressive to me from the beginning, but the exterior had to grow on me, i guess.	1
	the one thing the surprised me though was the power that the v6 has out on the road.	1
	the first time i drove a genesis it was on a short closed course.	1
	once i got a car on the ground i, of course, had to get it out on the highway and see what it would do.	1
	i was taking the car up a fairly large incline at 110mph+ and there was nothing but smooth, quiet acceleration.	1
	even going uphill at triple digits the car was strong and composed.	1
	i was very impressed with that.	1
	i am now officially in the 'wow, it's only $35,000!!'camp!	1

	what dealership would allow you to take a brand new car home for the weekend                and drive it untold miles not knowing whether or not you would buy or lease it?	1
	i don't know about you, but i take                 it all                with a grain of salt!                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2940#msg2940re: white genesi [jeffreid]        jeffreid,                                since you are a salesperson, maybe you can answer this question that came up in another forum.	1
	does the genesis actually have real wood trim in it at all?	1
	it was posted that the woodgrain on the dash was real, but that on the doors was faux.	1
	now, the only trim that has it on the dash is the base 3.8.  i know the 4.6 has the leather dash, but it gets a woodgrain steering wheel, which i could see being real wood.	1
	what's the real deal??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2941#msg2941re: white genesi [allmet33]        i do not think that there is any real wood in the genesis cabin at all.	1
	from what i have seen, all of it is the faux stuff.	1
	any of the models with the leather dash have pretty good 'wood' on the center console and on the gear shifter, but the 'wood' on the doors is not that great imo.	1
	i know that it is nitpicking, but the stuff on the doors is just so flat and has no character to it.	1
	no, it is not worth $5000-$25000 to get the real stuff to me, but i am just trying to be as critical as possible.	1
	i had my first sales training this morning with my new genesis.	1
	i was so pi**ed.	1
	my two best sales people looked at me like i was speaking russian when i started to ask them was what new and innovative with the genesis motor, tranny, interior, whatever!!	1
	one of them, a former engineer, told me that the v8 was a 4.3 liter and he had no clue as to why the car would be rear drive.	1
	no advantages he was aware of.	1
	i literally fell in the floor and asked them to shoot me now.	1
	both of these guys went with me to the genesis training!!	1
	i now see why you guys have had so many problems at other dealers.	1
	i assumed that when i told them to know the car from front to back that they would.	1
	uh, no.	1
	if there is not anyone in any of these other dealers that is taking the time to be sure that their people know their stuff, then it seems that there is no hope.	1
	my guys will be getting the thorough walk through with me today.	1
	they will know how to present this car front to back and side to side.	1
	it was so embarassing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2942#msg2942re: white genesi [jeffreid]        that's what i was thinking.	1
	i do like the way the faux ebony wood looks with the black interiors.	1
	i understand where you're coming from.	1
	it's no wonder customers end up coming in knowing more about the cars that are beign sold than most of the sales-people.	1
	i'm glad to know that you're making sure yours don't fall into that category.	1
	good job!	1

	yes i joined and posted the same day.	1
	gosh i'll just bet that's what most 'posters' do.	1
	what possible reason would someone join and just read for 2 months.	1
	no need to join if you don't have anything (of value) to post.	1
	it's actually funny that there are people who will post and repost some of the most ridiculous unimportant and uninformed comments.	1
	not that i need to prove anything, but i do occassionally scan the edmunds forums to get opinions, prices and reviews just to read.	1
	having such a great leasing experience and so impressed with the car i thought there may be some serious genesis seekers that would find my insight valuable.	1
	if you don't, then by all means keep popping into forums and sharing your 'valuable' stories....                                why would a dealer send a car out for a test drive for a weekend?	1
	well guess what, that's how smart dealerships (and high end dealerships)sell cars and particularly during rough sales times.	1
	i have had volvo, inifiniti and landrover all offer me a weekend.	1
	but perhaps this would be puzzling to a typical hyundai buyer.	1
	obviously sanglepus you haven't been a client of any of these manufacturers.	1
	hence the reason i suggested the genesis is not your typical hyundai.	1
	i also happen to have a family member who works for the dealership who conveyed, i'm sure, to the sales manager that i wasn't an internet junkie just looking for a free ride for the weekend.	1
	remember i leased one, so i would say this was a good move on the dealers part.	1
	deal was legit                car is awesome with a fabulous value lease                a large utah dealer                                you can take it with a grain of salt and go pay your dealer $4,000 over msrp pay triple on your money factor and buy gap insurance, that's fine with me,.... or you can just dream about it...       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2953#msg2953re: genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease [dueho]        i think it depends on the mentality of the dealership really.	1
	i mean, i bought a hyundai sonata and they didn't hesitate to give me the keys and told me to get lost with it.	1
	i was used to the usual cruise around the block and when i said i'll be right back, the salesman said...go pick up your wife, go pick up the kids...drive the car and find out what you think.	1
	when it came time for me to get my azera...they did the same thing.	1
	did i have it for the weekend, no, but i'm sure i could have if i asked.	1
	however, the fact they allowed me to have an extended test drive till i was ready to come back with it showed me they were serious about getting my money.       	1

	pray tell then, what does this and any other dealer do with a                 'used'                vehicle when it is returned to the dealership after having been                 'used'                and perhaps                 'abused'                over a couple of days and shows                several hundred miles on its odometer?	1
	as a customer, would you buy that vehicle even if it was exactly what you wanted as far as the colors and equipment are concerned                 or                would you pass on it and demand a                 'new'                not                 'used'                vehicle instead.	1
	it has been my experience that only the dealers who would do such a ridiculously risky thing are those dealers that were trying                 desperately                to                 unload                some                 hard to sell                vehicles.	1
	as some examples, the peugeot diesels or the mbz 240ds back in the seventies when you could not give them away.	1
	i caught holy h... when i brought back a brand new 240d with 175 miles on it.	1
	i got 'what are we supposed to do with that car now?'	1
	i did not buy it, but bought another car from them that was the exact color i wanted.	1
	btw, i lived in westlake village ca at that time, a rather high-end community even then,                so there was no question that i should be qualified.	1
	are the genesises already in such                   high                  supply that some dealers                  are resorting to these tatics to unload these v6 models?	1
	please field that question for us.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2960#msg2960re: genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease [snaglepus]        i'll preface by saying i haven't experienced a weekend test drive either, but i know that they occur and are offered depending on dealer (and maybe geographic location).	1
	gm even had their program advertised a while back; google for 'gm overnight test drive' (though that would fit into your 'trying to unload' argument).	1
	cars that are used like that likely end up being put out as service loaners, etc.	1
	i'm sure they don't let you pick any color, etc.	1
	that you want, just choose from their set aside cars.	1
	while i didn't know if the first guy is shilling for the car, he's not making up that degree of service, as i've seen many a reference to dealers allowing that.	1
	heck, i was surprised when my local ford dealer in iowa gave me the keys to a car and had me take it out for test drive by myself.	1
	that never would have happened in california; which is why i say it might be locale as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2961#msg2961re: genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease [snaglepus]        a car is new until it has been titled.	1
	that's the legal definition.	1
	at one dealership back in the 80's i saw - but never drove - a two year old new car with over 6000 miles on it.	1
	overnight/weekend test drives are not a big risk to the dealership.	1
	for one thing they will generally only have one or two vehicles of each model that they'll let go home.	1
	that way if miles are piled on they'll be isolated to just a few vehicles.	1
	and if the customer becomes a buyer there's a high probability that they'll take the car they were just driving.	1
	even if the customer does not become a buyer that day, they have presented a positive experience that can serve to draw the customer back and to make recommendations to others.       	1

	yes indeed, those are the ones sold as demo cars.	1
	and if the customer becomes a buyer there's a high probability that they'll take the car they were just driving.	1
	which is why they ask you exactly what you're looking for.	1
	if they have it, they put you in it to make you fall in love with it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2963#msg2963my impressions after 1,200 miles        i am new to blogging so i hope i am not jumping in the middle of another discussion that my comments will interrupt.	1
	i assume that someone will tell me to get lost if i am and/or if they think my impressions are bogus.	1
	here goes:                                vehicle:  genesis 3.8 with all options                                pros                1.  very smooth and powerful for a v6.	1
	lots of usable torque.	1
	2.  most intuitive 6-speed automatic transmission i have driven.	1
	3.  classy and well appointed interior.	1
	4.  good knockoff of i-drive toggle control.	1
	much better than bmw's own i-drive.	1
	5.  great torsional rigidity.	1
	very solid feel.	1
	9.  whisper-quiet!	1
	great isolation from wind noise.	1
	10.  good heated/cooled driver's seat.	1
	comfortable and supportive.	1
	11.  good navigation system.	1
	not as good as acura/honda's.	1
	12.  same with voice acitivated controls.	1
	acura's is much better.	1
	13.  very flat cornering.	1
	14.  good fuel mileage on highway.	1
	30 mpg at 65 mph;  28.5 at 80 mph.	1
	cons:                1.  steering is a pleasure on 'perfect' roads but not close to bmw-like on undulating surfaces.	1
	2.  overdone suspension stiffness without the finesse of a bmw.	1
	good, but not quite right.	1
	corner's great but does not think for itself (again ... like a bmw does).	1
	lexus quietness but with a more harsh, 'jiggly' ride on imperfect roads.	1
	3.  speedometer reads approximately 3% faster than you are actually traveling.	1
	(checked many times using gps speedometer).	1
	i have reported this to hyundai and they say it is 'within tolerance'.	1
	not the answer i would have hoped for!	1
	4.  they took the cheap way out with the front passenger seat.	1
	heated but not cooled.	1
	only slides forward and backward and reclines.	1
	no other adjustments.	1
	5.  the jury is still out of the brown leather accent trim on the dash and doors.	1
	not bad but i would have rather it was all black (my car is black on black).	1
	my bet is that the v8 will forgo the brown contrasting leather.	1
	bottom-line:                you should not read into the 'cons' above that i do not like this car.	1
	to the contrary, i am really impressed overall.	1
	like many of you, i am a car nut and consider myself to be very perceptive when comparing upscale cars.	1
	i have owned several lexus, mercedes, bmw and acuras.	1
	in many ways, the genesis stacks up better than most of those.	1
	it is just that they still have not quite achieved the intuitive handling of a bmw nor the ride of a mercedes or lexus.	1
	one last comment:  if the 4.6 engine is much of a step up from this 3.8, it will be one heck of a machine.	1
	this is the best six cylinder that i have ever owned.	1
	i think the 'perfect' six-speed transmission has a lot to do with it.	1
	i never thought i would own a hyundai but i am impressed!	1
	now, you can go ahead and tell me to butt out!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2964#msg2964re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [colegar]        good review and very similar to my feelings.	1
	i would add one more pro when comparing to lexus or mercedes:                                1.  a big sack with about $15,000.	1
	inside stuffed under the front seat!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2965#msg2965re: good deal?	1
	[tom17]        yup, 2k under invoice ($35,613 for pp and nav v6).	1
	$540/mo (incl nj taxes) 24 mos.	1
	good on dealer stock, and another dealer will do a swap for the color i'd prefer (blk/blk) for a few more out of pocket $$ up front (negotiating).	1
	hope to finalize this weekend.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2966#msg2966re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [houdini1]        wow!	1
	how did i forget the sack with $15k.	1
	you are correct.	1
	after i posted my pros and cons, i thought of one more nitpicking 'con' that bugs me.	1
	my last car (acura tl) had a much better tire pressure monitor.	1
	it showed the exact psi in each tire (by location).	1
	i am so anal that i really like being able to know exactly how much pressure each tire has.	1
	with the genesis, it will tell you that one of your tires has low pressure, but not how much pressure is in each tire.	1
	therefore, i now have to manually check my tire pressure each week.	1
	i was surprised that they invested so much into very sophisticated electronics and took a short cut on the tire pressure monitor.       	1

	i paid extra for a dealer 2 miles from my house.	1
	i was tired of saving a couple of hundred dollars then driving 30 or 45 minutes to the dealer to get service.	1
	yes i like to service the vehicle where i bought it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2976#msg2976re: prices paid genesis w/ pre plus package [mikey110890]        i understand your desire to have your car serviced where you purchased it.	1
	but any dealer will be more than happy to service your car regardless of where it was purchased since the service centers are typically run as seperate profit centers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2977#msg2977re: prices paid genesis w/ pre plus package [lucky4me2]        of course, if the pricing is within just a few dollars, the added convenience of a dealer provided loaner car may be worth the difference.	1
	not to mention the convenience of being 2 miles from home.	1
	my dealership provides a loaner for any overnight repair for our customers, something that can be quite valuable if a person doesn't have family handy or only has one car.	1
	just throwing that out there.	1
	i would think that this is something along the lines of the original poster's thought process.       	1

	[readyformyrl]        maxon in union.	1
	global in plainfield was willing to do a similar deal.	1
	i had misinterpreted deal...it was better than i thought.	1
	$540/mo was with no money down and included all inception fees.	1
	so no money to change hands.	1
	but i ended up not liking the biege color and they would only do a swap with another dealer at invoice, not below.	1
	so i will keep the $540/mo, but will pay the equivalent of inception fees...$2,000.	1
	a lot to pay for color i know...but you have to love your car and i think the blk/blk is more my style.	1
	by the way, i am 6'5' and fit really well.	1
	and my road bike, which is huge, fits in the trunk once i take the wheels off.	1
	that is really unusual and means no bike rack for me.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2979#msg2979re: genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease [speedbump47]        i just finished up test driving the genesis (with tech pkg) at my local dealership.	1
	very pleasant experience, for any car dealer, moreso since it was beyond my expectations for hyundai.	1
	they even offered to set me up with an overnight if i desired, even though i had made it clear early on i wasn't buying today since i was waiting to try the v8.	1
	salesman said only 3 people in the dealership were allowed to sell the genesis, since they had attended the training.	1
	very knowledgeable about the car and had clearly played with the toys inside.	1
	my impressions of the car:                                1)  smooth power delivery                2)  ride a bit cushy; hope the v8 will be more taut                3)  nice fit and finish; better than i expected (one thing to read about it, another to sit in it)                4)  great interior room (front and back)                5)  cool backup camera                                nitpicks                1)  voice activation system needs work; way too slow and inaccurate                2)  only driver seat cooled                3)  uncovered speaker in trunk does detract a bit; passthrough hole is likely only big enough for skis or a few 2x4s.	1
	i think they have a winner on their hands, assuming people can get over the 'stigma' of owning a hyundai.	1
	even the salesman's wife was a 'car snob'.	1
	my dealer is getting 1 v8 at the end of september, but it's already sold.	1
	said they'd probably get a total of 4 for the remainder of the year.	1
	they're declining anything but the tech package v6's from corporate, since that's all that are selling for them.	1
	have sold 8 so far, 4 others sitting on the lot.	1
	said they hadn't seen much 'halo effect' from the car yet, but hoped as the advertising campaign started that people would realize if the $35k hyundai was good, maybe the $20k hyundais were good too.	1
	they said they had a $399 lease deal on the base car, but i didn't inquire much further since i wasn't buying.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2981#msg2981re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        why are you comparing the a6 v6 to the genesis v8?	1
	wouldn't a more fair comparison be v6s or v8s on both cars?	1
	also, why do you assume best case for the a6 and worst case ($5k markup over sticker) for the genesis?	1
	why not compare the a6 to a loaded genesis v6 at $35,613 (see post about a page back)?	1
	looks like you want the a6, so go buy it and enjoy it!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2982#msg2982re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [backy]        ok backy, since you seem to be hung up on v6 to v6 comparisons  here ya go                                genesis v6 with technology package                msrp=$40,000                invoice=$37,363                lets say average selling price=$38,500                5 yr, $38,500, 0 down, 5.24% apr=$741 month                                audi a6                msrp=$58,515                invoice=$54,429                selling price=$46,704                5 yr, $46,704, 0 down, .9% apr =$808 month                                so for an additional $67 more a month, one can drive a audi a6 vs genesis v6                so for an additional $97 more a month one can drive a genesis v8 vs a audi v6                                lastly its not all about 0-60 and 2 more cylinders.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2983#msg2983re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        since you seem like you're buying vs. leasing, one thing to consider is long-term maintenance and reliability.	1
	the hyundai has a longer warranty and, anecdotally speaking, the audi is likely to have more issues down the road and cost more to fix when it does break.	1
	also, while i haven't seen the new a6, i think the genesis is likely a bigger car inside, so they may be different 'size' categories.	1
	one other unknown, if you plan on selling at some point, is the depreciation on the cars.	1
	neither is particularly known for its long-term value retention, but who knows which will be worse.	1
	though, looking at the msrp for the audi, it looks like you're getting a steal of a purchase price at an almost free interest rate.	1
	i'm a bit jealous                                tough choices, but hopefully consideration of these points will make your decision less worrisome.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2984#msg2984re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        the bose sound system ruins the audi for me.	1
	why put a third rate sound system in an expensive car?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2985#msg2985re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        an additional $97/mo for the v8 genesis?	1
	even at msrp you would be paying a lower payment than you would on the a6, and in parts of the country you can get 1.90% for 60mo on a genesis.	1
	that would reduce the payment to $734 which is $74/mo less than the a6.	1
	also, if one considers the possibility of finding $1000-$2000 off msrp, that would reduce your payment $17-$35 per month further.	1
	oh yeah, and the $38,500 v6 then becomes $673/mo, a savings of $135/mo.	1
	that's $8100 over 5 years!!	1
	i just thought that these additional facts might be worth consideration.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2988#msg2988re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [dueho]        i believe that honda actually agreed to a settlement in a class-action suit a few years ago because their speedometers and/or odometers were allegedly registering incorrectly, allegedly overstating the miles traveled.	1
	this would have the effect of using up the warranty mileage too early.	1
	in the interest of fairness, i do realize that some companies decide to settle class action suits even when they believe the case to be without merit.	1
	i also believe honda/acura to be one of the best automobile companies in the industry.	1
	when i reported my concern to my local hyundai dealer, i was pleased that they immediately passed it upstream to their district representatives.	1
	the answer came back that two or three mph difference at 50 to 60 mph was well within tolerance.	1
	when i pointed out that 3% of 60,000 miles would amount to an 1,800 mile short change of the warranty, i was told that the speedometer and the odometer are completely separate and that i could rest assured that the odometer is accurate.	1
	i confess to being skeptical but i do not plan to make an issue out of it.	1
	unless the odometer is completely mechanical and the speedometer is electronic, i don't understand why one could be so accurate and the other 3% to 4% off.	1
	the next time i am on an interstate trip, i will check the odometer against the mile posts on the interstate over a long enough distance to make it a reasonably valid comparison.	1
	again, unless i find a significant and expensive descrepancy, i do not plan to get all worked up over it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2989#msg2989re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        why in the world would you buy?	1
	the lease is so amazing on the genesis, i bet you could save at least $150 a month leasing as opposed to buying.	1
	so let's say you buy the car, and i lease the car.	1
	4 years down the road, you are driving a 4 year old car, and you are still paying $741 per month.	1
	at that point, you have paid in $35568.	1
	4 years down the road, i am driving a car that is 2 years old (because when my 2 year lease was up on the first one, i got another one).	1
	for the last 4 years, i have been paying $591 a month.	1
	at that point, i have paid a total of $28368, or $7200 less than you, and i am driving a newer nicer car.	1
	and did i mention that in that scenario, at the end of year 4, you are still stuck with your car, and i am just then picking up my 3rd new car, still paying the same thing.	1
	how will that feel when we meet at the stop light, and i am in my new 2014 genesis, and you are in your 2009 audi?	1
	you paid all this extra money to drive an older car, what in the world did you gain at that point?	1
	i know what your saying though, at the end of all your payments you own it.	1
	you own what?	1
	a 5 year old used car.	1
	if you are driving these kinds of cars, you are not the type that is shooting for a 'no payment' situation.	1
	after 5 years, you are going to want a new car.	1
	now you have to sell your car.	1
	if you can find a buyer, you may be able to get approximately twice the amount that i saved over those same 5 years leasing as opposed to buying.	1
	so let's say you have at the end of 5 years, $20,000 in your pocket (after you sold your 5 year old car), and i have $10,000 in my pocket from the savings i had leasing over buying.	1
	i came out the loser right?	1
	no, i got something for my money, i drove a newer car for 3 out of those 5 years.	1
	not to mention i was covered by my warranty the entire time.	1
	and, i knew exactly what was going to happen with my car.	1
	when you own, you cannot predict how much you will be able to sell your car for, or if you can sell it at all.	1
	personally, at the end of the day, i would rather save money in the short term, with a known outcome, than 'try' to save more money in the long term, and be unsure as to what exactly will happen.	1
	a leased car drives the same, looks the same, smells the same, and feels the same, as a bought car.	1
	not to mention leasing gets you a newer nicer car along the way, for less money.	1
	just my opinion.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/2991#msg2991gps lost data        there seems to be a problem with the gps system on at least three cars with the tech package.	1
	there is another forum 'genesis owners' forum where three of us have experienced a problem of loosing data that has been entered into the gps system when the gas tank is filled.	1
	it has happened to me on two occasions and yesterday it happened to two others.	1
	i have not seen this problem posted on this forum.	1
	perhaps those that own the tech package should make a point of checking that they have at least one address entered into their gps address book and then checking to see if it is still there after the next fill up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2992#msg2992re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [fdesign]        as a counterpoint, buying does make sense to certain people as well.	1
	bear in mind, i know you're talking about leasing a genesis vs. buying an audi, but i'll assume we're talking about leasing vs. buying a genesis.	1
	first, i think you're being a bit generous in the assumption that 4-5 years from now you'd be able to pay the same on a lease and get a similar caliber car every time.	1
	that being said, having a car that you know the history of in order to hand down, etc.	1
	(vs. buying a used car) is something that provides value to people; it's the way things were done in my family.	1
	also, in this case, 5 years down the road, you'd still be in warranty for the vehicle, so the 2 year switch wouldn't be giving that much extra value.	1
	not to mention that some people worry about going over mileage limits and/or repairing scratches/dings before returning the vehicle.	1
	not trying to pick apart your argument; financially it makes sense for the type of person who really likes having the newest stuff and who'd like to save money on the monthly payments.	1
	i just didn't want the flip side to be mis-represented; namely that people who can afford to buy these things aren't always looking at short term or having a fresh new ride.	1
	especially since body styles shift at a 4-5 year rate anyway.	1
	the 2011 genesis likely won't look a whole lot different than a 2009 one to most people.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2993#msg2993re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [colegar]        i agree with both of you.	1

	the speedometer on my santa fe said i was going 35 mph.	1
	( maybe the electronic speedometer was wrong) this is no major issue with me but one would hope that a $40,000 car would have an acurate speedometer.	1

	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/2995#msg2995re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [fdesign]        generally, the more expensive the car, the more leasing makes sense.	1
	if you buy, the hit in depreciation may not be excessive percentage wise, but the actual dollar figure may be high.	1
	the less expensive cars, say the camry or accord might make relatively good purchases because the depreciation will not be severe and you'll be able to recoup a substantial portion of your 'investment' when trading it.	1
	also, there is a psychological stigma to 'owning' a car as opposed to just 'renting' it.	1
	but, most cars should be treated as depreciating assets and not as investments.	1
	cars are a money-losing deal 99.999% of the time.	1
	there are unknowns, such as the price of fuel.	1
	the people that leased their suvs in 2006 or 2007 will be in much better shape when their leases expire than those who bought and are depending on the trade-in value to fund the down payment of their next vehicle.       	1

	that's catchy, but if you're after the lowest possible cost per mile, you'll buy  hold.	1
	ever notice that almost no recognized authority on personal finance has anything good to say about personal leases?	1
	(business leases are another matter.)	1
	still, leasing might make sense for this particular car.	1
	the genesis is an unknown quantity - we don't know how well it will hold up or what it will be worth in 5 or 6 years - so a short-term lease might be a sensible way to limit your risk.	1
	but whether you buy or lease, what's the rush?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3004#msg3004re: genesis: excellent vehicle, exceptional lease [kanaka77]        thanks for the great review of the lease deal.	1
	to be clear, when you say $2199 out of pocket, do you mean a down payment of $2199 plus the acquisition and doc fees?	1
	... which would be total out of pocket of $3097 at signing.	1
	or, does the $2199 include those fees as well as the 1st months payment?	1
	my soon to expire '06 saab 9-5 lease with gmac had a sales price of $34,200, 0 down payment and out of pocket at signing of $1380 which was made up of 670 acq fee, 275 doc fee and first months payment of 434. the $434 included state sls tx.	1
	and it was for 15,000 miles/yr.	1
	so, without the $2000 down, the saab/gmac lease is 'better' than the current genesis lease.	1
	of course, gm is no longer interested in lease deals and has priced them accordingly.	1
	i shopped a cts today and leasing prices are out of the question and purchase is the only realstic option.	1
	so yes, you are correct, the genesis lease in today's market is a good one by current standards.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3005#msg3005genesis test drive        i finally had my opportunity to test drive the genesis, a v6 and v8 at hyundai's sponsored ride  drive event which was held at gulfstream park in hallandale beach, florida.for competitive comparisons, they featured the cadillac cts and the mercedes e550.	1
	first up, was the cts, a 3.6l di v6                304 hp.	1
	the first test on this course was the wet test; this was designed to see how well the traction control technology was implemented in the cts.	1
	although it seemed to work well, it sounded as if there was a lot of commotion occurring underneath the car.	1
	it certainly didn't sound smooth or behave as if it was well balanced but it got the job done.	1
	throttle response was good however, but the handling was not as agile, neither was there any spare room in the cabin.	1
	talk about tight interior space!	1
	after the cts, i drove a genesis v6 with tech package, its 3.8l v6                290 hp was under foot.	1
	it passed the wet test with nary a hint of protest as the traction control kicked in almost immediately and any wheel slippage was instantly buffeted and controlled, so much so, that it was barely perceptible!	1
	the handling felt very well balanced and much tighter than the cts throughout the course!	1
	certainly, the caddy shouldve been able to manage this much better than the genesis, since its msrp is at least $10k more.	1
	next up was the mercedes e550, a 5.5 v8 with 382 hp and like the genesis does not offer direct injection.	1
	it aced the wet test, just as smoothly as the genesis.	1
	the throttle response was excellent and the handling felt superb, especially when throwing it through the angled curves of the course.	1
	this car made me smile.	1
	however, although it displayed tight and nimble handling, once again because of the relatively tight confines, it left me wanting, as in more room especially for the extra $30k!	1
	ok, so now, up comes, the genesis v8, tech package, featuring its 4.6l and 375 hp.	1
	save the best for last right?	1
	well apart from the wet test, which it once again traversed with hardly a murmur, the throttle was almost equal to the e550, the handling did not feel as tight, but it certainly never felt as if it would slip from under me and wherever i pushed it in the course, especially on the turns, it obeyed, giving me more confidence as it accelerated out of the turns.	1
	the brakes on all were very good, but extra credit goes to both the e550 and the genesis.	1
	i rated the genesis quiet ride and handling to be exceptional.	1
	given the price point of both the cts and e550, i somehow expected these cars to outdo the genesis because that is exactly what anyone would expect.	1
	somehow that didnt happen and that is what the biggest surprise for me is about my experience with the genesis.	1
	it gives you all this room, tight fit and finish, excellent handling, a luxury ride and yet still delivers value-over-badge.	1
	comparing it to vehicles in the same class, i think the genesis succeeds at delivering.	1
	if i had any doubts about this vehicle it was erased after my test drive experience.	1
	anyone looking for more than what the genesis has to offer will need to spend even more.	1
	the question is why?       	1

	also, some of the automotive publications have noted that the v6 with a slightly better front/rear weight balance actually handles better than the heavier v8.	1
	could you notice any difference when you test drove them?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3009#msg3009re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [dave174]        depends on how much car you actually want too.	1
	the a6 is a mid-sized sedan and the genesis is a full sized sedan with much more room.	1
	if the a6 fits your needs, then go for it, but another cost you're not putting in there is maintenance, then on top of that, hyundai's 10yr/100k mile warranty to boot.	1
	also, you're taking $46k for the 3.6 v-6 cranking out 255 hp, hardly comparable to the 290 hp the 3.8 in the genesis puts out.	1
	you wanna jump up to the a6 4.2 for just over $50k?	1
	well...that's a better comparison power-wise to the genesis 4.6, but at a cost of $10k or more (depending on what kinda deals folks can get when the v-8 genesis finally drops).                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3010#msg3010re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [mn778]         leasing is the only way to go if you have pride in your ride!	1
	"\                                                i don't lease and i have pride in my ride, that's why i keep it up by keeping it clean and taking care of the preventive maintenance."	1
	leasing has nothing to do with pride in a vehicle, it has to do with someone that wants to save money and be able to get a new car every couple/few years without much loss.	1
	however, there are those of us that buy a car and drive it till the wheels fall off.	1
	in cases like that, a lease makes no sense at all.	1
	the flip side, i buy a car and pay $530 over 5 years for a total of $31,800, right?	1
	that means in 5 years, i'll have a car that's in great shape (if its been taken care of), still under warranty (depending on the miles driven) and no car note.	1
	so...while you'll be going on your 3rd lease by that time, you'll have a new car and end up having spent more money in the process.	1
	there's always 2 sides to every coin my friend and not every situation fits everybody.	1
	what may work great for you, may not be worth a hill of beans to me.	1
	leases mean you have to worry about mileage, personally...i pay a car note to not have to worry about how many miles i drive.	1

	not sure how you might take care of a car, but it can be done.	1
	yes, those that know wheels can pick the tell-tale signs of which model year you have and be quite impressed that it looks as good as it does.	1
	you're right some folks must be seen in the latest greatest to stroke their egos.	1
	as far as technology goes...with all the aftermarket stuff that's out there, any car can be just as up-to-date as the newest tech loaded model and there are plenty that are.	1
	do i knock folks for wanting to upgrade vehicles every couple years, heck no...let them take the hit on vehicle price and after they turn it in, the person that buys it afterwards gets a huge break.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3013#msg3013another advantage to leasing        another advantage to leasing is that it allows you to 'experiment' with vehicles such as the genesis, without worry.	1
	you know up front what it's going to cost you to own this vehicle.	1
	if the vehicle is a success (as it looks like it's going to be) you can buy it - probably for less than the later models will cost.	1
	that was the pattern with lexus.	1
	if the model is a failure, you're not stuck with depreciation - how'd you like to have been a phaeton buyer, and taken the hit on the resale?	1
	same with the land rover discovery after the problems started to crop up there.	1
	buyers took a hit; leasers walked away.	1
	the second generation of the genesis will be the one to buy - or the first generation when it comes off lease.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3014#msg3014re: another advantage to leasing [lokki]        agreed...very good point.	1
	it seems that some of us that bought the 1st generation (early production) azera's fared better than those up until the new '09 (jury is still out on that though).	1

	i too was a little disappointed in the cts, but you must take into account that the cts can now be bought very well loaded for the same price or less than the genesis.	1
	you can get about $10,000- off msrp right now.	1

	i think it's been well stated, hyundai shot for benz, but landed at about infiniti in terms of quality...that's still not bad at all on their first shot of making a luxury sedan.	1

	i don't care how much you take care of your ride, it won't look new                                i completely disagree, i  do have a 2000 black trasam that still turn heads and looks less than a year old, granted it has only 26000 miles and used mostly for weekend pleasure driving.	1
	other than regular maintenance, upgraded brake pads, summer tire change and a simple professional tune chip mod (ops did i say that?!)	1
	nothing has been  done to  this old bird                                last year on atlanta motor speedway, i did not have the bottle to take this baby beyond 150 with a measured 4.8 seconds 0-60, but let me tell you i had plenty of pride when my instructor red lined her at 168 miles per hour (speed trapped with my blessing of course).	1

	[joe97]        sphotani,                                yes, you can get the genesis winged emblems (front and back), as well as the official kdm center wheel cap wing emblem and also the crome door strips (found on the v-8) -- all at korean auto imports.	1
	i have ordered and istalled the front and rear emblems on my genesis and the center wheel caps too.	1
	the chrome strips are on order too.	1
	kai can get the original oem parts from hyundai, but so can some ebay sellers if you are willing to wait a little longer (they charge less).	1
	here is the link for koreanautoimports:                                 http://www.koreanautoimports.com/store/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=genes- isoscsid=ae6cf320cbf206be4426f227a9114464                                here is the link for the ebay seller that also sells these parts:                                 http://search.ebay.com/hyundai-genesis-emblem_w0qq_trksidzm37q2el1313qqfromzr40                                here is a description of how to install the front winged emblem.	1
	the rear one does not require any modification but the front one - which is formefit the hood - requires you to trim off the pegs on the badge (the korean genesis version has two holes in the hood where the front emblem connects).	1
	it was pretty easy to do this:                                 http://genesisowners.com/hyundai-genesis-forum/showthread.php?t=278                                ** note that this thread was started before we knew that they sold a separate rear badge that does not require sanding..       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3035#msg3035re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [speedbump47]        yeah, but how much sense does it make to trade a car in to cover a lease???	1
	i mean...we're talking a car that he'll be giving back!!!	1
	smart money would be trade it in on a buy, finance what's left over (easily a $200/mo.	1
	note), pay it off in half the time (which means less interest paid) and now the car is more of an asset because it's paid for.       	1

	you may recall from one my older posts, i also have a free car note on low millage v6 suv (probably with a small down payment may eliminate finance altogether), however some of my issues are;                                - i have 20 miles daily trip                - not to sure how gennisis value will hold up in couple of years.	1
	- my job may take me overseas in couple of years.	1
	- the current lease offer appears to be very attractive..                                as it has been mentioned before, 'leasing is not for everyone but may work for some!'	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3038#msg3038re: audi a6 vs gennesis v8 [allmet33]         using a vehicle as trade on a lease is just the same as throwing money away.	1
	not to mention the fact that you would most likely get two to three times as much money for a car like that firebird if you sold it to a transam lover than if you traded it to a dealer that sees the car as nothing more than another unit on the floorplan.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3039#msg3039almost bought it        we have come so close to purchasing the genesis, but a few things are causing us to hold back.	1

	2. why wouldn't they put lumbar support in the passenger seat?	1
	there is also no cooling in the passenger seat.	1
	3. reclining seats in the rear would have been nice.	1
	4. we and our friends sat in the rear seats for a lengthy period of time and found them to be very hard.	1
	we all agreed that travelling a long distance with four people would result in the two in back becoming very uncomfortable.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3042#msg3042re: almost bought it [allmet33]        i think the whole point of non-reclining rear seats is to keep the noise levels extremely low.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3043#msg3043re: almost bought it [moocow1]        absolutely right if he meant fold down rear seats rather than reclining seats.	1

	also, some of the automotive publications have noted that the v6 with a slightly better front/rear weight balance actually handles better than the heavier v8.	1
	could you notice any difference when you test drove them?'	1
	the power difference between the 3.8 v6 and 4.6 v8 is better explained like this: the v6 seemed to be more responsive in that the power comes on right away, where as the v8's power builds gradually but once it gets going it really takes off.	1
	as far as handling i will give the edge to the 3.8. i suspect the weight ratio difference helps in that respect.	1

	you can get about $10,000- off msrp right now.	1
	as far as the mercedes goes, it was substatially better than the genesis.	1
	before you think i am bashing the genesis, i am not.	1
	i liked it, and i am seriously thinking of leasing one.	1
	however, if the price of all 3 vehicles were the same, i would take the mercedes in a heartbeat.'	1
	i'm not sure there is any disagreement.	1
	the purpose of the test drive was to compare and contrast the competitive class that the genesis is entering.	1
	in that regard, the genesis compares quite favorably with the cts and e550.	1
	i think we both agreed that the e550 handles better than the genesis in terms of handling finesse, which i have already stated.	1
	however, the fact is, the genesis is competitive in that it offers far more room, refinement, quality fit-and-finish, and is rationally priced, compared to the e550s $40k price difference.	1
	this makes up for any short comings and makes it a much more compelling proposition.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3056#msg3056re: almost bought it [houdini1]        you could be right, but...how many luxury cars have fold down rear seats???	1
	i don't hear anyone buying a benz, lexus, bmw or infinity wishing the rear seat folded down.	1
	it's just funny, folks are praising the genesis for it's luxury attributes, but wish it had something found in non-luxury sedans.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3057#msg3057re: almost bought it [dueho]        i remember the first few years of the 1st gen g35 sedan had reclining seats.	1
	anyone remember why that option was done away with?	1
	was it purely cost savings or something to do with interior volume/rigidity/weight, etc?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3058#msg3058re: almost bought it [allmet33]        it could be because a certain segment of the target demographic is 'moving up' from front-wheel drive cars and not understanding that lack of fold down rears is common in the rwd luxury segment.	1
	i think it has less to do with being more harsh on genesis and more to do with it being the first car of that class they've investigated.	1
	or maybe the 'pass-through' option is highlighting the fact that the seats don't fold down; i don't believe the 1st gen ls400 we owned had fold downs (or a passthrough) and it wasn't apparent until we tried to do it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3059#msg3059re: almost bought it [speedbump47]        i see and any luxury car that may have had a fold down rear seat was very short lived because it's not something you hear about at all.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3062#msg3062re: deal?	1
	[tjc78]        i don't know why they didn't give me the price, but the lease terms were the lowest i could get from any dealer and seems lower than the national push.	1
	the lease calculator says i should be paying 421 a month, but the payments that are scheduled are 321 a month.	1
	could it be that they just used the 33000 price to figure the residual but actually base the payments on the 28900 price?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3063#msg3063why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	i don't understand why this is not an issue with anyone here.	1
	this car, like many today, has very poor rear visability.	1
	a rear back-up sensor, not a camera, should be standard on any car with limited visability.	1
	this is not just a genesis problem.	1
	i have shopped the cts and the new a4 and both of them require you to buy the maximum packages inorder to get a rear sensor or camera.	1
	this is being packaged as a luxury item by all of these manufacturers, when in fact it is a basic safety item.	1
	for those of you who have a genesis or will be driving one soon, put the car in reverse, back-up, and tell if if you would be able to see a small child or other object.	1
	we should all be raising a stink about this, or they will keep on designing cars for style over function, and then charging us max dollars for a simple safety device.	1
	i would like to lease this car, but i don't want to be forced to buy the tech package.	1
	and i don't want to have to pay to have this installed after-market on a leased car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3064#msg3064re: why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	[traderj]        well...like the cts and a4 (don't know why you would shop an a4 if you're looking at cts and genesis) anyway...if you get the fully loaded version of any genesis (tech package) you get the back up camera.	1
	however, on all models below the tech package (base, premium and premium plus), i do think back-up sensors should be standard.	1
	did hyundai get everything right in their first roll with a luxury car, no...not quite.	1
	you're right, if enough folks raise cain about this issue...it could very well find it's way into upcoming refreshes.	1
	however, there are very inexpensive back up cameras that are easy to install and can be removed without any damage to the vehicle when the lease is up and you can use it on your next vehicle as well.	1
	you know, the camera that attaches to the license plate frame.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3065#msg3065re: why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	[traderj]        not to be argumentative, but is the visibility really that much worse than most other cars?	1
	unless you're driving a hatchback or something (with a low window right above the bumper), the rear visibility is always going to be obscured by the trunk or be too high (as in an suv or minivan).	1
	by your test criteria, i don't think any of my cars would enable me to see an object or person right behind the vehicle; which is why i was always taught to walk around the back of a car to get in the driver's door or to back into spaces.	1
	while i agree that having an active mechanism reduces accident potential even more (things rolling/running behind after you get in the car), are these cars that inherently bad/unsafe visibility-wise or is it more that something vying in this 'luxury' marketspace should have it?	1
	simpler said, if the corolla had this genesis body, would you be up in arms mandating that they have a cheap backup indicator?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3066#msg3066re: why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	[traderj]        to my knowledge, and correct me if i am mistaken, most cars in this class and above, even one or two below come either with backup sensors or camera but not both.	1
	this is true of a lot of vehicles i've seen, and the case for hyundai vehicles (those with sensors don't have cameras, those with cameras don't have sensors).	1
	as for the limited visibility, i don't think the genesis is any more or less than other large sedans.	1
	the blind spot behind the car is something every vehicle has, obviously, and some less than others; but i'm pretty sure all sedans are about the same in this area.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3067#msg3067re: why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	[speedbump47]        two wrongs don't make a right.	1
	you can't justify the lack of a back-up sensor in the genesis by saying that other cars don't have it.	1
	the rear back-up sensor would not only help prevent accidents, but it will save your rear bumper when backing into a parking spot or when you must give your car to a valet to park.	1
	perhaps i am just older than most of you, but i can remember when i would turn around and look backwards to back-up, i would be able to see my trunk.	1
	these days cars are designed with smaller, more angled rear windows and you cannot see the trunk at all.	1
	the reason car manufacturers are not making an item like this standard is simply because we are not demanding it.	1
	if they thought sales were affected  by the omition of this, they would include it.	1
	this happens to be a very inexpensive item.	1
	if the base genesis was $33,100- or $33,200-, but included the rear sensor, would anyone here not buy it.	1
	on the contrary, i think they might even get a few more sales.       	1

	2009 hyundai genesis delivers nhtsa five-star safety ratings                                fountain valley, calif., 08/27/2008 the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) awarded five-star crash test ratings, the highest government rankings under the agencys new car assessment program, to the all-new 2009 hyundai genesis for both frontal and side-impact crash tests.	1
	genesis was engineered with a lightweight but strong body shell, featuring ultra-high tensile steel, laser welding, and advanced adhesive bonding, said john krafcik, vice president of strategic planning and product development, hyundai motor america.	1
	add eight airbags and electronic active head restraints and you can see the focus we placed on designing genesis for occupant safety.	1
	these five-star results are just one indication of the dedication hyundai engineers place on safety.	1
	maintaining hyundai's emphasis on delivering leading safety technology, genesis boasts world-class active and passive safety features that both prevent accidents and maximize the well-being of its occupants in the event of a collision.	1
	the genesis continues the hyundai tradition of standardizing key life-saving safety technology, with features such as electronic stability control (esc), eight airbags and electronic active head restraints.	1
	esc compares the drivers intended course with the vehicles actual response.	1
	it then brakes individual front or rear wheels and/or reduces engine power as needed in certain driving circumstances to help correct understeer or oversteer.	1
	genesis' eight airbags include advanced dual front airbags, front and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags, and roof-mounted side curtain airbags for both front and rear outboard seat occupants.	1
	hyundai is the first popular brand to offer electronic active front head restraints, a standard feature on the 2009 genesis, which are an improvement over mechanically-based active head restraint systems.	1
	until now, electronic active head restraints could only be found on select mercedes-benz, bmw and lexus models.	1
	active front head restraints have been proven by the insurance institute for highway safety to help prevent whiplash.	1
	genesis is brought to a halt by large four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes with brake assist and electronic brake distribution (ebd).	1
	the v6 models feature 12.6-inch front rotors with single-piston floating calipers, while the v8 models feature 13-inch front rotors with four-piston calipers.	1
	all models are equipped with 12.4-inch rear rotors.       	1

	i understand your viewpoint a bit better now.	1
	being 6'0' and having a high seating position preference, i haven't yet driven something that i couldn't either a) see the trunk at least somewhat or b) guesstimate the trunk position after driving it for a bit.	1
	that, plus the fact that i don't need to valet or parallel park probably makes it so that i would be unaware/unaffected by the difficulties presented by the shape of these vehicles.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3073#msg3073re: why no rear back-up sensor?	1
	[traderj]        to a degree, you have a valid argument, but...with rearward visibility being consistent among various cars (narrow windows, high/short trunks) it would be an argument lost in the wind.	1
	also, folks would demand more trunk space vs. bigger, lower rear windows.	1
	thus, the availability of back-up cameras.	1
	either they can come factory installed with packages for certain trims of various models, or...you can look on-line or go to an automotive store and see if they carry an aftermarket back-up camera unit that's easily installed to increase your rearward visibility.	1
	they even sell the back up sensors that can be installed in your rear bumper for a very good price.	1
	6 air bags are great, but not an industry standard...do you think that'll change?	1
	as far as the base genesis goes...when folks see how much more you get by paying $2k more for the premium package, the base model becomes an afterthought.       	1

	[pghsteelers412]        no deal!	1
	putiing money down, or 'cap cost reduction' as dealers like to call it, flies in the face of leasing.	1
	in effect, all you are doing is prepaying part of your lease payments.	1
	just take the $4000- and divide it by 24, then add that to your monthly payment.	1
	what you get is your actual monthly payment.	1
	no one should ever put money down on a lease.	1
	it is simply a marketing ploy, so that dealers can advertise a lower monthly payment, which is what attracts customers.	1
	i could advertise a 24 month lease for $5-/mo.	1
	oh yeah, you have to read the small print which says you have to put down $20,000-.	1
	when you start negotiating a lease, the very first thing you tell the dealer is 'no money down'.	1
	then let him calculate a monthly payment.	1
	of course i am not referring to your first month's payment, tax tag and titile, which should be paid up front.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3075#msg3075re: new to leasing...am i getting a good deal???	1
	[traderj]        ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...the whole idea of putting money down whether you buy or lease to to lower your monthly payments, isn't it???	1
	if you put the money down, then your monthly payment is lowered, if you don't put the money down, then you make up for that in your monthly payments.	1
	it's all a matter of which # the customer is happier with.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3076#msg3076re: new to leasing...am i getting a good deal???	1
	[pghsteelers412]        bottom line here is the dealer only took $500 off the price of a $40k car.	1
	i certainly wouldn't buy the car outright with so little of a discount.....so i would have to say that isn't a great deal.	1
	as for putting money down on a lease, if you drive that car off the lot and total it you just lost $4000.	1
	roll that money into the lease and put the cash into an interest bearing account in case you need it.	1
	putting a lot of money down on a lease is not a very smart thing.	1
	just read any of the leasing forums here on edmunds, you will see this come up often       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3077#msg3077bought a saphire blue / black premium package        hi all,                                i have been looking at this car and have been posting and getting information from you all in this forum.	1
	i finally found one that i wanted and at a reasonable price.	1
	though i have to driven 800 miles to take it home!!!	1
	yes, i bought my genesis in kansas city and drove back to detroit - sounds crazy.	1
	now some info on the deal i got and the dealer i worked with.	1
	i was looking at the lease option from the beginning unless i get something really good on the sale price which i doubted from the post here where most of the dealers were marking up few thousand dollars above msrp.	1
	mccarthy olathe - (chuck is the sales guy and wies is the manager)                                msrp - 35,000                sale price - 32,200                invoice - 32,963 (including $150 advertising fees that hyundai is recovering from each car sold)                fees - $300                                my impressions on the car after driving 1000 miles in just one day!	1
	pros:  very comfortable, control on the road is very good even when i was cutting corners at 100mph in the night i never felt unsecured that car will do something wrong, never left the lane, i do not feel any back pain and leg pain after driving for 15 hours in a day, never felt this in my other long trips in the suv i drive!	1
	the acceleration is too good though it is not as quick when you start, music system is just awesome, i haven't heard this clarity even in acura or lexus.	1
	smaller tyres and i mean it, i test drove both the 18' wheels and 17' wheels which i bought - the ride is definitely more comfortable with 17', 18' is definitely more firm and passes on more road irregularities to the driver.	1
	also, like others i liked how the 17' look compared to 18'.	1
	and now biggest of all - mpg economy                i purposely did something different during my trip to understand the mpg you get from this car, here is my observation:                                -  if you drive the car with cruise on - the mpg is better, yes it is true.	1
	something to do with how the engine is tuned for cruise driving probably.	1
	- when i drove below 70 mpg on highway without cruise on - i got around 28.1 mpg                - when i drove below 70 mpg on highway with cruise on - i got around 27.3 mpg                - when i drove on streets i got around 21 mpg (no cruise)                - when i drove above 70 mpg on highway without cruise on - i got around 25.6 mpg                - when i drove above 70 mpg on highway with cruise on - i got around 26.2 mpg                                so i think the published mpg of 18 and 27 will hold good if you drive the car below 70 mpg on freeway and streets.	1
	cons: nothing that i think of right now - the car is still growing on me.	1
	only thing i wished if i had a back up camera and the passenger seat with 8 way settings for my wife to also feel comfortable on such long drives!	1
	i will be happy to give more details on the deal if anyone wants it.       	1

	just curious if any genesis shoppers have cross-shopped the pontiac g8?	1
	i recently tested the gen along w/ the new cts and the g8, and must say the genesis  g8 were both alot of 'bang for the buck'.	1
	the g8 really accelerates and has nice interior appointments, and is so much more a performer than the cts (that car imo is the most over-rated vehicle i've driven lately).	1
	the genesis seems a bit more refined, but also a bit more reserved.	1
	i think from a true drivers standpoint the g8 wins, although gm may not even be around in a few years                both cars have spacious interiors, nice styling and alot of features for the money.	1
	just wondering why the g8 isn't mentioned in any of these threads.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3081#msg3081re: any gen buyers test the g8?	1
	[blnewto]        i think you hit the nail on the head.	1
	the reason you haven't seen these cars cross shopped here is because they attract a different audience.	1
	the g8 is more of a driver's car and the genesis  is a more relaxed comfort vehicle.	1
	the cts is also not really a good comparison, as that was designed to be a much firmer ride in the mode of bmw.	1
	the genesis would be better compared to the sts, a big vehicle with a softer ride.	1

	[pghsteelers412]        as a non-lesee and all the time purchaser- i know nothing about lesses as well.	1
	but here i am pondering getting a 2009 genesis 'v6 technology package' which                you are all aware msrp's at $40,000.00                                and i have at least two dealerships (in the los angeles area) after major negotiations (helps that the manager's are friends of mine at these dealerships)                willing to sell any 2009 genesis v6 technology package for $40,000.00 'otd'-                and most people say if you can get a car 'otd' for what it msrp's at- you have                a very good deal.	1
	so yes- both of these dealerships are going into their 2% holdback- big time!	1
	but i don't know if i want the v6 or according to the local la hyundai rep- the v8's aren't expected to arrive till late october.	1
	i just wish hyundai announces that they will treat genesis buyers differently- since i am spoiled being a lexus owner and getting treated overall- great- if anything breaks or doesn't work- usually replace it if possible- no questions asked.	1

	[kenbt]        i have the same concerns as you about customer service from the dealer.	1
	i have also been spoiled by my current dealer, in my case it is cadillac.	1
	their service has been great.	1
	always providing loaner cars, calling with progress, friendly, etc.	1
	in july, i planned a trip from miami to western north carolina.	1
	we packed our car, got ready to leave, and then the car wouldn't start.	1
	i called the service manager at cadillac and told him what happened.	1
	in 20 minutes he had a tech at my house.	1
	they installed a new battery.	1
	i got into my car and as i left on vacation i looked at my watch.	1
	it was only 30 minutes since i made the call.	1
	now, i know if i get the hyundai and that happens, i'm screwed.	1
	but since gm doesn't want to lease anymore, i guess i am going to take my chances.	1
	i'll just hope that i have no need for service.	1
	i've been to 2 hyundai dealerships and both are terrible.	1
	of course, my other concern is the resale value of the genesis which is why i will only lease.	1
	i hope it is a good car and that it holds up over time, but at this point we just don't know.	1
	that is why i would only lease this at this time.       	1

	[traderj]        i know my predicament is not just mine...                                one time i had to bring my lexus in because one of the small buttons on my stereo system would not go in all the way- basically it didn't align evenly with the other buttons.	1
	so i told the service rep about it- said they would fix it.	1
	they said it might be a day or so- didn't worry since rental car was given.	1
	then about two days later i was called to pick it up.	1
	i looked at the warranty receipt when i picked the car up- said malfunctioning button- ordered new cd head unit- i think it was $1k plus- was shocked- so knew lexus rocks!	1
	another time i went in to check my tire pressure on one tire-  they checked the tire pressure on all tires- then i saw my car leave- i said what is going on- they said-                sorry- now we have to wash it....                                it will be hard to see what hyundai does- they have great reviews on the genesis- but when you bring it in for service- it is going to a hyundai dealership- the mass market.	1
	like i said i think basically both of the dealers will make less than a ben franklin if that- since besides selling it for $40,000.00 otd- they are giving me a full tank of gas (since if you are aware because of gas prices- most dealers are only giving $20.00 of gas), ct- cargo tray and wl- wheel locks- all pio.	1
	so if i knew how the customer service will be handled- i would buy now- but even                with this 'extremely great deal'- i just wait and see.       	1

	other thing is the moment you fill the tank, the mpg goes up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3087#msg3087gas mileage        so i have 1200 miles on my genesis v6.	1
	i don't know how you guys are getting the mpg you are showing.	1
	i am reading the average mpg the car is giving me.	1
	i keep resetting it, and checking it after about 100 miles.	1
	i checked it today, i am averaging 17.8 mpg.	1
	i drive 19 miles to work on a highway, with 1 stoplight in between, then i drive 19 miles home with 1 stoplight, same route.	1
	i do not do jack-rabbit starts, and i am not constantly flooring it.	1
	i would say i am drive fairly normal, but of course i goose it here and there, after all, i should be able to enjoy my car yes?	1
	the last time i filled up, i even used 92 octane fuel, just to see if it would help.	1
	now, here is where i may be being a bad boy, i have to admit, i do cruise to work at an average speed of about 85 miles per hour, with no cruise control.	1
	i am having a hard time believing however, that the extra mph would dent the mpg that much.	1
	maybe its me, maybe its the gas here in mn, because my azera got crappy mpg also, about the same, average about 18 mpg, same route.	1
	no way in hell however, i can see getting close to 28 mpg even on a flat road, no wind, and the cruise control on 60.  i tried it, best i could see was maybe 24.5 in perfect conditions.	1
	oh well, thats my experience so far.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3088#msg3088re: gas mileage [sthede]        the new epa mileage estimates are actually very accurate.	1
	their method of calculation changed in 2008. driving at 85mph will affect the mileage but probably no more than 10%.	1
	but, the first 1200 miles is probably not indicative of what you will get in the long run.	1
	i have had my cadillac sts for 2 years and i am getting better mileage now than i was after 1 year, which was better than i was getting  when it was new.	1
	it even exceeds the epa ratings.	1
	now, i also live in florida where the roads are all flat, the weather is nice all year, and we are at sea level.	1
	those things will make your mileage vary too.	1
	and, putting premium fuel in your car will do nothing to improve mileage.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3089#msg3089re: gas mileage [sthede]        i have about 2000 miles on my genesis.	1
	we completed an 1087 mile round-trip to our vacation home about 2 weeks ago.	1
	of that 1087 miles, about 900 was highway driving at a relatively constant 75 mph with cruise control.	1
	the remainder of the miles were accumulated with around-town driving while at our vacation home.	1
	for the trip, i filled up at the beginning, added fuel twice, and filled up again as soon as i got home.	1
	the entire trip consumed 37.0 gallons of regular, for a trip average of 29.4 mpg.	1
	not bad -- wonder what this thing will do when it gets broken in?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3090#msg3090re: gas mileage [lakerunner4h]        my azera (with essentially the same engine as the genesis v6) gets excellent gas mileage on the highway.	1
	sometimes i can average above 30 mpg on the highway.	1
	city gas mileage, on the other hand, is awful.	1
	in regular city traffic, it can hover around 15 mpg.	1
	if it drive on  non-congested roads, it will get 17-18.   stop and go city traffic  can be as low as an horrific 12-13 mpg.	1
	unfortunately, about 70% of my driving is city and only 30% is highway.	1
	the only exception is when i'm on a vacation and mainly travel highway.	1
	but usually it's heavy on the city driving.	1
	i feel lucky if i can eek out 19-20 mpg on an average week.	1
	the genesis should get slightly better mileage than the azera because of the 6 speed auto transmission (versus the 5 speed on the azera).	1
	but the engine/trans set-up greatly favors highway driving and somewhat penalizes city driving.	1
	if you drive mostly highway, i think it'll be great.	1
	i am really quite impressed with the highway mileage.	1
	if you drive mainly city, i think you might be disappointed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3091#msg3091re: gas mileage [sthede]                        only 1200 miles on the odometer is not nearly enough to sample your average mpg.	1
	your                 brand new engine                has not even started to get                 'loosened'                up yet.	1
	at those two (one each way) stoplights, how do you take off from them?	1
	do you use minimum throttle and force the tranny to up shift early and                do you use the manual feature and start off from rest in second gear?	1
	cruising at 85 mph is a real mpg killer.	1
	try 60 mph and see what happens.	1
	it has been said that 85 mph would only be a 10 percent hit.	1
	that is most certainly not so.	1
	probably closer to a 25 percent hit!	1
	just changing from 60 to 65 mph with our azera costs me 5 mpg in our well broken in car.	1
	a full tank of premium is supposed to raise the horsepower at least a little on the v8s, but i                don't know if they did the same thing on the v6s.	1
	that would indicate to me that on the v8s,                hyundai has cranked up the timing a little to take advantage of using higher octane.	1
	'i would say i am drive fairly normal, but of course i goose it                  here and there, after all, i should be able to enjoy my car yes?'	1
	but of course, but every time you do so, you are indeed wasting fuel!	1
	does the genesis have a constant mpg read out on its computer?	1
	the azera does not.	1
	you say at an average speed of close to 85 mph.	1
	that would indicate                to me that on occasion, you are exceeding 85 mph at times?	1
	'maybe it's me, maybe it's the gas here in mn, because my azera got crappy mpg also, about the same, average about 18 mpg, same route.'	1
	it is indeed you                because i do know what your azera should get based on our azera.	1
	it is not mn gasoline.	1
	do you warm the car up at all before you leave home or work?	1
	or do you start it up and                 immediately drop it in gear and proceed slowly?	1
	at a dead stop, how many mpg are you getting?	1
	'no way in hell however, i can see getting close to 28 mpg even on a flat road, no wind,                  and the cruise control on 60. i tried it, best i could see was maybe 24.5 in perfect conditions.'	1
	no.	1
	not yet account of no miles to speak of on your genesis,                but you will see improvement as it does accumulate miles.	1
	tire pressures are?	1
	the higher the better for fuel economy.	1
	are those dunlops tire of the low rolling resistance type?	1
	as a side note, my last tank mileage on our azera for 525 miles                using 19.3 gallons of costco regular was over 27 mpg.	1
	no light was on yet.	1
	i regularly do this.	1
	this last mileage test included several cold starts, a little local                stop and go driving, but mostly interstate at a set 60 mph.	1
	i used the a/c as needed also.	1
	if you are willing to drive at 60 mph and allow almost everyone                to pass you, your mileage will improve big time.	1
	your car can and will beat your azera i am sure.	1
	why?	1
	because of the higher gearing overall when in sixth speed and the                slightly narrower tires if you don't have the option 18 inch wheels?	1
	compare your rpms at 60 mph between the azera and the genesis.	1
	isn't the genesis turning fewer rpms at 60 mph?	1
	how much btw?	1
	driving at 60 mph instead of 85 mph will only cost you less than six minutes travel time.	1
	and perhaps save you a costly speeding ticket also?	1
	i hope i haven't left anything out?	1
	hang in there and modify your driving habits just a little and                you will see improvement in your miles per gallon readings!                                        	1

	less impressive that they were trying to mark it up $1,700 over sticker, but the salesman at least had the grace to look embarrassed.	1

	they are generally complimentary but make it very clear where they stand: they don't think the genesis is a 'sports sedan' in any way, shape, or form.	1
	they take hyundai to task for suggesting (in marketing literature for example) that the genesis should be considered a sports sedan.	1
	they point out deficiencies in ride and handling, among other things.	1

	i shop for value, not brand name and the genesis looks like a good value.	1
	i'm very close to making the decision to purchase/lease but, like many here, am concerned about the level of service that hyundai dealers can or will provide for buyers in this price range.	1

	i'm hopeful that others on this forum who own the car can answer a few simple questions.	1
	when i test drove the vehicle the other day, i attempted to test the smart cruise control.	1
	unless it activates at less than about 25 feet, the car i drove did not have smart cruise.	1
	does anyone know if there is a switch or setting that has to be activated before it works?	1
	also, given that we all have different comfort levels with distances to follow someone, can the distance it will maintain behind a car be adjusted?	1
	does anyone know what happened to the 30 (or 40) gigabyte harddrive that was mentioned in a few reviews and in the early promotional brochure from hyundai?	1
	as far as i can tell they left this option on the factory shelf.	1
	(probably will be available on next years version.)	1
	does the audio system have speed sensitive volume?	1
	if so, how effective are you finding it?	1
	is it just me or does the model with the tech package have a stiffer ride than the 3.8 with premium package only?	1

	what an opportunity to spread good word of mouth they are missing.	1
	rick and rita case not only want $5 above the 29.95 msrp on the cable.	1
	they want $700 for a window tint they force you to buy, on top of their market adjustment, that was either 1495 or 1995 when i bought my car a month ago (elsewhere).	1
	i have bought 4 hondas from their sister store next store, rick case honda, and when i go to the parts counter, i present my rick case rewards card and get a discount.	1
	i get my car washed for free anytime i want and i get discounted gasoline, that card is not honored at the hyundai store.	1
	they treat me well when i want a honda.	1
	why not treat me well when i 'try' to buy a hyundai?	1
	do they think people's iq drop when they walk into a hyundai store?	1
	i am blessed that 5 bucks is not a big deal to me, i am glad you are fortunate and 5 bucks is not a big deal to you either tom17, but it is the principle.	1
	the point here is that i consider the genesis to be one of the best values out there in the luxury sedan market, and it would be a real shame for people not to indulge in such a great car, because of a few short sighted dealers out there.	1
	i have driven over 2,400 miles in my first month and enjoyed every single mile as the best car overall i have driven.	1
	during my 10  (1994- 2004) years as a wholesaler in the car business, i have driven for extended periods (at least a week) , over 300 used  luxury cars, including mb, bmw, audi, infinity, lexus, acura, jaguar and even a rolls royce and the genesis rates at least 95% as good as most of those cars.	1
	when you factor in price and leave out 'prestige', the genesis looks pretty good.	1
	by the way, if 5 bucks is not a big deal to you, i suggest you send that amount to your favorite charity.	1
	and if rick or rita are reading this, i am aware you guys contribute heavily to charities, send the 5 bucks you overcharge on each ipod cable to charity.	1

	[rjwrde]         'is it just me or does the model with the tech package have a stiffer ride than the 3.8 with premium package only?	1
	i found that i was hearing/feeling every crack in the road much more with the tech pac than on                  the one without it.	1
	it was on different days and different roads so could just be my memory.'	1
	no.	1
	it is                 not your imagination.	1
	the tech package equipped car would indeed have a stiffer ride.	1
	doesn't the model with the premium package have dunlop 225/                 55                -17 tires?	1
	the tech package includes 235/                 50                r18 tires doesn't it?	1
	if the tires pressures are properly set at the recommended psi for both different sized tires,                the car with the                 lower profile                tires (                 the 235/                   50                  -r18 tire                )                 will indeed ride a little bit harder                .	1
	also, perhaps the tech equipped car you test-drove had                 not had its tires adjusted properly to                  the recommended pressures                and had too much air in its tires, making it ride even stiffer?	1
	all hyundais are shipped with way higher than recommended tire pressures.	1
	if you are really surious about discovering which profile tires you want, take your own                trusty tire gauge along and adjust the psi of each set before you compare the rides.	1

	[traderj]        it is helpful to understand typical sales department of most auto dealership.	1
	most non luxury dealerships such as hyundai,honda,nissan,toyota etc...                sales reps job is to show vehicles,write up deals,hand over keys and go over with                the car after transaction is done.	1
	generally, these reps have very little knowledge                of lease numbers or have any authority to negotiate numbers.	1
	in 2008, we have all kinds of info on internet for any specific car.	1
	it's not difficult                to get all the facts,including invoices,specifications,reviews etc... before walking                in the showroom!	1

	he                should have more information than typical sales reps. same thing in service                department, if you are not satisfied,ask for service manager.	1
	i'd hope that any                larger dealerships would have qualified sales manager and service manager on                duty during business hours.	1
	as far as genesis is concerned, i think it offers luxury,performance,good looks,                enough sportiness at a very reasonable msrp.	1

	i'm surprised that the tech package would need that much storage but whatever, i'm happy enough with a six pack cd it just seemed odd that i hadn't read about the hard drive except in a few early reviews.	1
	i'm surprised that there is no smart cruise control because i have been told by two sales people  that it is included and read several reports that make mention of it.	1
	viking 967                                thanks for the comments about the tire size and pressures.	1

	i will do exactly as you suggested and check the tire pressures before my next test drive.	1
	i would guess that the tp on the last test drive was way to high because that is exactly what it sounded and felt like.	1
	every little ripple in the road was being transmitted to the steering wheel.	1
	i'm confused by your comment that the car doesn't have speed sensitive volume but does have separate volume control for each function.	1
	that would seem like the worst of all possible scenarios.	1
	i can see the blue tooth phone volume being set separately because each phone may be different than the next - hyundai wouldn't have control of that, but they can and should be making sure that when you change to a new source that it comes in at the same volume as whatever you were just listening to.	1
	you may want to adjust the volume but i don't need to be surprised by a sudden increase in volume just because i changed from cd to xm or vice versa.	1
	regarding the glitch with the loss of stored  gps information, that sounds like an issue that hyundai should be addressing.	1
	it seems that the car resets some info -such as the distance to empty - when you fill up, so there is some coding in the firmware that tells it to reset things.	1
	i can't think of any reason that it should dump the gps info.       	1

	i guess they are simply trying much too hard to cut corners and not spend any more than                is absolutely necessary.	1
	there are many examples of that almost everywhere you look.	1
	one example was the one size smaller tire when compared to the azera as mentioned earlier.	1
	how much more would it cost to mount 235s instead of the 225s they are using on the genesis?	1
	tirerack lists the standard 225/55-17 dunlop tire at $166 each.	1
	go to a 235/55-17 dunlop that has the same speed rating (h) and that tire is only $113, a $55 saving                per wheel for a slightly wider tire with the same speed rating and it is a                 better longer wearing tire                !	1
	in this case, hyundai would have saved money and so would the customer.	1

	when i went back and looked through some of the reviews, i couldn't find any that make reference to the smart cruise control, so i realize now that i got the idea from the sales people i've been dealing with.	1
	i've been to three different dealers and all of them have indicated that the smart cruise control is part of the tech package.	1
	the funny thing is, i'm not even sure that i would want smart cruise control, but now that it appears to not even be available, despite their saying that it is, i need to start going over the car item by item to verify what is actually included.	1
	since the brochure is virtually useless, it is difficult to keep track of what's what.	1
	my point is, in many instances, someone is not really thinking wouldn't you say?	1
	i'm beginning to think that hyundai has missed the mark with their sales training and information packages for sure.	1
	i'm a self admitted gadget guy, so it is disappointing to be led to believe that there are features on the car that turn out to not be there.	1
	i guess because the car is so new, they were still working out the final package while they were letting the reviewers test it out.	1
	that's where i got the idea that there was a 40 gig hard drive that you could rip music too from cd's - with the lexicon sound system, that would be a great feature.	1

	it never was said whether it was a cost issue or if it was that they didn't feel the their tech was ready on that system.	1
	for all we know, it could simply be that hma wanted to have something to add next year.	1

	[sandy25]        thanks sandy, i had a look at the ebrochure on the us website.	1
	unfortunately the canadian website doesn't offer the same - you can request a brochure by mail but there's no downloadable one.	1
	the problem is that it appears there are differences between the specs on the us car versus the canadian model.	1
	for example, i've seen three v6 cars all with the premium package and one with the tech pac.	1
	none of these cars had the leather on the dash.	1
	don't know if the v8 model will have that available here or not.	1
	while looking at the us brochure though, i noticed one more feature - that the sales people here have been talking up - missing.	1
	don't know if this is another 'piece of candy' that got taken away or not but what i'm referring to is the automatic electronic park brake.	1
	i was told (by a sales manager, and a sales person at a second dealership) that the tech package includes a function that allows you to not have to keep your foot on the brake in stop and go traffic.	1
	once you've stopped, you can take your foot off the brake and the brakes will stay engaged til you press on the gas.	1
	when i got to drive the tech package car, the sales person there didn't know what i was talking about.	1
	does anyone out there that owns a genesis know anything about this feature?	1
	i have a feeling this went away the same as the smart cruise control.	1
	i've seen pictures in some of the reviews that show a button down below the parking sensor switch, so it was there at one point.	1
	since there is no mention of this in the brochure i'm guessing that it has gone away.	1
	i guess this one problem with the internet, we get to do all our own research, but sometimes we get the early info that turns out to be wrong.	1
	on the other hand this missing feature (?)	1
	was being touted by the sales manager so how do you find out what's true and what's not.	1
	that's why i'm asking here - hopefully the people that own the car will be able to clarify things.	1
	don't take this the wrong way, i'm still pretty impressed with the car and will quite likely be negotiating on one by the end of the week - i'm just frustrated by the confusion and disappointed that several of the bells and whistles seem to have been left on a shelf somewhere in korea.	1

	i certainly don't have a feature that allows you to take your foot off the brake after you have stopped and keep you stopped until you put your foot on the gas.	1
	also, i don't see any button below the parking sensor on my car or in the brochure.	1
	i've never heard of this feature.	1
	is this actually available on some other car?	1
	i have the tech package.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3132#msg3132nice but no thanks        i have been waiting for the genesis and finally got a chance to test drive it.	1
	nice car but definitely not in the class of the luxury brands.	1
	i have an old rl and there is a huge difference.	1
	i understand that there is the price difference.	1
	so, if you are in the market for a car, the genesis is a good car.	1
	i do not think i would put it in the class of a maxima either.	1
	i think the maxima is more luxurious.	1

	i certainly don't have a feature that allows you to take your foot off the brake after you have stopped and keep you stopped until you put your foot on the gas.	1
	also, i don't see any button below the parking sensor on my car or in the brochure.	1
	i'm afraid you may be right although i got the same story from two different dealers.	1
	one was the sales manager going on at great length about the features on the tech package that he claims to have sold their first one to the first customer he showed it too.	1
	the second was a sales woman who brought the automatic brake system up as a feature.	1
	both were unprompted and seemed pretty definite.	1
	i don't know if this feature is available on other makes or not - it was new to me too.	1
	unfortunately, so far i've struck out on every feature that i've had a question about.	1
	like i said earlier, there seems to be a huge amount of information floating around on both the web and the sales rooms that is turning out to be inaccurate or based on early concepts.	1
	obviously, i am only asking questions about the things that i'm unable to verify by other means and there are still a lot of good features on the car that are accurately portrayed.	1
	i found a picture of the auto-brake button but can't seem to copy it into a post.	1
	it is from more than a year ago but i've seen the same button in a photo in another review that i can't find again.	1

	initially you subject was titled, 'more balanced reviews are coming out...', and i may have interpret it incorrectly as if earlier reviews were balanced, enough...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3137#msg3137re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [richard124]        the genesis does have an electric parking brake.	1
	however, the last comment about having to keep your foot on the brake at a stoplight is correct.	1
	wouldn't want to try and prove that one!!	1
	the electric parking brake is one that engages when you put the car in park.	1
	there is no need to pull a lever, press a button, or mash a pedal.	1
	the brake is set simply by putting the car in park.	1
	just an observation, but there seems to be a really wide gap in the perception of this car.	1
	on one end, i saw a post here that claims that the 2009 max is a more luxurious car than the genesis (which i strongly and respectfully disagree with), and then on another end i have seen posts from current/previous lux brand owners that put the genesis right in the same league as those cars.	1
	matter of fact, the first genesis that my store sold was to an e-class owner that said he thought that the genesis was nicer.	1
	does anyone have some thoughts as to the rather huge divide seen here?	1
	oh yes, on another note.	1
	and i'm sure this is a no brainer to most.	1
	sold a second genesis last week and took a 300c on trade.	1
	if anyone has sat inside of these two vehicles within any kind of close time frame, i sure think it is miles nicer inside of the genesis.	1
	i was forgetting how nice the genesis really is at $35k-$36k!!	1
	i am a little unsure as to how any of these auto mag comparos can throw the 300c into the mix and have it hold any kind of a chance.	1
	just too much plastic and cheap leather.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3138#msg3138re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [jeffreid]        jeffreid,                my parking brake does not automatically engage or disengage when putting it in park or taking it out of park.	1
	the brake peddle is marked, 'push-on-off'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3139#msg3139re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [jeffreid]        i was not aware that the genesis engages the parking brake automatically every time it is put in park.	1
	therefore, i presume there is no manual parking brake mechanism (pedal to push or handle to pull)?	1
	when i test drove the genesis about a month ago, the salesman had not been to any training.	1
	he had a cheat sheet he carried with him with the different options included with each package.	1
	that was about the extent of his knowledge.	1
	at the time my local dealer had none (florida), but i was on vacation in scottsdale arizona and did the test drive there.	1
	i dont know if it was the 110 degree heat or the extremely low fuel level (warning light was on), but the car was very underpowered even compared to my cadillac dts rental.	1
	i have test driven the 09 maxima (in florida) and although i would not say it is as roomy or luxurious as the genesis, i definitely prefer it performance wise.	1
	no comparison in my mind.	1
	i own an 08 lexus gs350 and prefer the human interface of the nav (touch screen) and the general layout of the dash.	1
	i also definitely prefer the performance of the gs.	1
	i will admit that the genesis is a larger car much closer to the size of the ls.	1
	i went to the initial coming out party for the 300c many years ago.	1
	the car did absolutely nothing for me as far as the interior  exterior design is concerned.	1
	have not ever driven the 300c (almost rented one time but our luggage would not fit in the trunk - rented a dts instead), but have driven the similar dodge charger rt.	1
	performance wise i would have no trouble owning a charger rt.	1
	my only problem would be the very low mpg.	1
	the interior / exterior design of the charger is better than the 300c but no where near any of the foreign cars.	1
	my local dealer now has 13 genesis.	1
	when the v8 and pearl white color finally hit the lot i will go and try it again.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3140#msg3140re: some more balanced reviews coming out... [ksmigel]        i'm still trying to figure out where hyundai has ever stated they were making a luxury sport sedan.	1
	to the best of my knowledge...the genesis was always touted to be just a large luxury sedan that used the e-class  5-series as benchmarks.	1
	does that mean they tried to take the best that both had to offer and put them together, i think not.	1
	i think what they benchmarked was what is it that makes them luxury sedans and since benz and bmw pretty much sit atop the luxury segment (aside from lexus of course)...why not use them to build a foundation, right?	1
	well...with the genesis looking like more of a lexus, maybe it would have been smarter for them to say that they benchmarked lexus when creating the genesis...they would have been spot on.	1
	also, folks need to realize...benchmarking doesn't mean they make an exact duplicate of whatever is being 'benchmarked'.	1
	it means they study it and find what qualities it has to make it what it is and they bring their own interpretation to the table.	1
	in that right, hyundai has succeeded (in my opinion).	1
	again, where has it ever been stated that the genesis sedan would be a luxury sport sedan??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3141#msg3141where has it...  been stated that the genesis ... would be a luxu          '... where has it ever been stated that the genesis sedan would be a luxury sport sedan??? '	1
	uhm, how about on the hyundai genesis website?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3142#msg3142re: again, where has it ever been stated that the genesis sedan would be a luxu [lokki]        i guess it's all about interpretation.	1
	when i asked that question, it was meant more literally...where does it specifically state that the genesis sedan is a luxury sport sedan???	1
	braking and acceleration mean nothing in terms of sport, it's the handling that would be the deciding factor, coupled with the other two categories.	1
	yes, the genesis can accelerate quite nicely, it can stop rather impressively (even though brake fade has been noted in testing), but...it's not the car you want to be in when cruising mountain by-passes with switch-backs and hair-pins along the way.	1
	however, to say it demonstrates better cornering (wet or dry) than a bmw 550i...that's a mouthful!!	1

	[rjwrde]        read the oct. review in car and driver - it's pretty good.	1
	i think they also mention that the adaptive cruise control is a future item.	1
	from what i have read about cars that do have them, they may not be all that worthwhile.	1
	the article also noted that there is a suspension issue for the spring rates and damping over other than smooth roads.	1
	for me, that is where 80% of my driving takes place                the genesis 'specilast' at my dealer went to a 2-3 day 'school' where they drove other cars and got briefed on the genesis.	1
	he seemed pretty knowledgeable.	1
	the brochure's first page refers to the genesis as a 'luxury sports sedan.'	1
	however, i think most reviewers will say it is a luxury sedan as cd did.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3144#msg3144re: some more balanced reviews coming out... [allmet33]        i just received a letter from hyundai thanking me for attending their genesis discovery test drive.	1
	the letter describes the genesis as a 'premium sports sedan'.	1
	it is certainly not.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3145#msg3145re: some more balanced reviews coming out... [traderj]        that's really odd, because outside of that...it's really the only time i've ever heard hyundai portend the genesis to be a 'sport' sedan.	1
	it certainly does have some sporty tendancies with acceleration and braking as well as decent numbers on the skid pad, but in the end...it's too softly tuned to be a sports sedan.	1
	however, maybe, just maybe...a coilover spring system will be created for the genesis (as is now for the azera) and make it a true sports sedan contender.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3146#msg3146re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [richard124]        from my understanding the electric parking brake is a secondary system that automatically engages and disengages without and driver input.       	1

	richard:                                i'm glad to hear that you checked the manual, i agree that if there was anything like this it would (should) be in the owner's manual.	1
	i spoke with one of the sales people i've been dealing with (her sales manager is on vacation this week so couldn't talk with him) and asked her about this feature.	1
	she referred to it as 'parking assist' today which is different than what had been described to me earlier.	1
	the term 'parking assist'  is consistent with the idea of an electronic system that would automatically engage the park brake when you put the car in park.	1
	having a foot pedal - which i know the car has - as well would allow for setting the parking brake manually whenever you decide to do so.	1
	the idea of an automatic parking brake being set whenever the car is in 'park' seems like a pretty good idea.	1
	i know that i've stretched the bands in a few automatics before realizing the importance of engaging the parking brake to take the load off the transmission when you park your car on a slightly inclined driveway night after night for several years.	1
	i'm pretty religious about using my pb now but that's what 40 years of driving gets you.	1
	my sales person has promised to look into this -as well as a few of the other missing toys - i'm kinda using this as a test of the effort she's willing to put into the deal- i'll post a message if she comes up with any worthwhile info.	1

	it has a graphic display indicating the portion of the car that is close and even indicates which direction to turn the steering wheel to avoid collision.	1
	i have heard that the genesis offers such a system implemented with beeps.	1
	it has nothing to do with an automatic parking brake (at least on lexus).	1
	can a genesis tech package owner verify if their car can automatically engage the parking brake?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3152#msg3152re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [tom17]        you are correct about the park assist distance monitor [peep, peep, peep] in the front, sides and rear bumpers.	1
	the brake does not automatically engage, that's why there is an emergency foot brake.	1
	my wife's passat has an electronic brake button that can be used even if you are in gear.	1
	i think that's what the mix up is!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3153#msg3153re: staying stopped with foot off the brake [tom17]        i have a genesis with the tech package.	1
	the parking brake does not automatically engage or disengage when putting it in or taking it out of park.	1
	our driveway has a slight incline.	1
	when putting the car in park and not setting the parking brake the car does the slightest roll back until the transmission hits whatever keeps the car stationary.	1

	personally i used to live in a few other countries                but now i'm living in seoul.	1
	i test drove a genesis before, just to check how                nice it was (i couldn't buy one since i'm not a rich guy, and the genesis v6s 3.3,3.8 would cost you something around $50-75k otd on purchase, and the gas prices are $7/gal), and what i felt was that, i do agree with a lot of people in this forum that this is a car hyundai should be proud of.	1
	i'll check this forum out from time to time to know whether this car could hold up with the big market.	1

	while checking out whatever i could read on the net about the ls460 a week ago, i came across the genesis for the very first time ever.	1

	how on earth does hyundai ever expect to win over supporters of the top 3 with this alien approach to selling their supposedly premium luxury outsider?	1
	are they afraid of something, so they lock puchasers into a deal before they drive their cars, so they cannot back out by that stage?	1
	i would have imagined that, given hyundai's wanting to break into a segment that is clearly dominated by marques that have stood their ground for many decades, they would be bending over backwards to promote their contender.	1
	not only have i never seen any advertising for this car before (and i'm a petrolhead who spends every spare moment digesting car info), but they believe purchasers will be swayed into their stable just by looking at their car?	1

	a different take on the situation might be that this new sales approach is purposely contrived to demonstrate hyundai's absolute confidence in their product, so much so that they believe that test driving the car will not be a significant factor in the customer's decision making process.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3170#msg3170re: shocking [lp13]        it probably doesn't help any that it's the only dealership you can access.	1
	their mentality may be 'if you don't like it, tough!'	1
	it really sucks that their is only one dealerhip.	1
	in my area...i have access to like 6 or 7 dealerships so if i don't like one...go check out another one.	1
	fortunately, the 2 i've been to have been great.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3171#msg3171re: shocking [allmet33]        when i was shopping last year, it came down to the azera vs .	1
	lexus es.	1
	the hyundai dealer kept in touch, let me drive the car as long as i wanted and called me asap when hyundai lowered the price.	1
	i stood in the lexus showroom for 15 minutes watching three salesmen joking with one another.	1
	the manager came through and asked if i was being served and then got a salesman.	1
	he was pleasant but never talked money at all and never followed up.	1
	i called and asked for a price quote and he e-mailed me the msrp spec sheet for base and all options.	1
	no follow up after that.	1
	if he had called and offered decent discount, i might be in an lexus today.	1
	of course the es is really a luxury camry and i really liked the azera better.	1
	so, many dealers have poor marketing and sales people.	1
	ironically when i went in to look at an ls in april, the sales woman gave me the keys to a new 460 and a used 430 and let me go where i wanted to.	1
	they did follow up, but not enough discount to trade in azera.	1
	high hopes that genesis 3.8 will be proven out by 2010/2011.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3172#msg3172re: shocking [carolinabob]        i feel you completely!	1
	i think all brands of car suffer from having bad dealerships, it just seems that hyundai has more than it's share (going based on the complaints i've read in various forums).	1
	i am pleased to hear that there are actually hyundai dealerships that do get 'it' and treat the customer like they really want their business.	1
	the one i frequent has been actually upgrading their facility (perhaps to accomodate the look of a place that sells a luxury car).	1
	they've gone from no car wash at all to washing your car no matter what you bring it in for (even if it's already clean no less).	1
	i was saddened one day to walk in and see a salesperson watching a movie on his computer...during business hours!!!	1
	i think the genesis will actually get better by getting some of the things that were left off that folks feel it should have.	1
	at least i hope hyundai has their ear to the ground and listening.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3173#msg3173re: shocking [carolinabob]        i don't doubt that one will find sub standard dealerships of all marques.	1
	i guess my astonishment in this case is because a new product is challenging the big guns - hyundai ought to put more effort into it.	1
	anyway, thanks for indulging my complaining spirit everyone.	1
	at this juncture i will bow out of your interesting forum graciously.	1
	good luck with what the majority of you describe as a truly outstanding car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3174#msg3174father-in-law genesis experience        had never sat in a hyundai before and never had even considered one.	1
	went to the dealership where he sat in a 3.8 with tech pkg.	1
	the salesperson assisted him but didn't know how to start the vehicle.	1
	it's a shame because i am quite sure he would've loved the car.	1
	how a dealership management can allow the position of a salesperson to be reduced to something moronic is beyond me.	1
	as a former salesperson, who took it very seriously and understood it req'd extensive time investment for product knowledge, also keeping in mind the realization that every customer is potential lifetime residual income, someone at the hyundai dealership in saint john (sales manager) is not doing their job to train their staff.	1
	i earned over $100k a year in sales and it wasn't 'easy money'.	1
	how do these people get on the floor when they have never done a walkaround on a genesis?	1
	how is it that they can be sent out to the public to sell a $46,000 car and don't even have a clue about the basics of the sales process.	1
	someone isn't getting this.	1
	the genesis is probably the bargain of the century and hyundai's objective to enhance their brand image with this product is being destroyed by laziness and the inability of their dealerships to properly train their staff to move the product.	1
	it requires a basic understanding of how to work with people and some very serious product knowledge beyond 'it's a v6 with a lot of power'.	1
	i am quite convinced that hyundai should probably hire me to oversee sales training for their canadian or regional sales operations.	1
	do they even have such a thing?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3175#msg3175re: father-in-law genesis experience [prosource1]        i don't know........i purchased a v6/tech, and my salesman was very knowledgeable, helpful and very proffesional.	1
	he told me he was selected to attend the genesis sales training sessions that are being held around the country by zones.	1
	my experience was top notch!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3176#msg3176re: father-in-law genesis experience [prosource1]        there is no person or office that works for a mfr that is directly involved with training dealership staff with hyundai, or with probably any other brand for that matter.	1
	every dealership is an independent franchise and is responsible for their own employees.	1
	some simply choose to care, and some do not.	1
	it is going to (most likely) take a total overhaul of the auto industry to change the way that individual sales staffs operate.	1
	i think that maybe an industry wide shift to saturn-like fixed pricing would allow the people in the individual dealers to quit worrying about negotiations and screaming 'we've got the lowest prices and will beat everyone else by $100 dollars' and start thinking about providing an informative and positive experience for their clients.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3177#msg3177re: father-in-law genesis experience [jeffreid]        hyundai is having each dealership send at least one salesperson to the genesis 'school' to learn about the car and compare it to others.	1
	the genesis specialist at my dealership was very knowledgeable.	1
	maybe some dealers opted out.	1
	btw, consumer guide automotive already has a review on the                 2010                  genesis sedan.	1
	is it that close?         	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3178#msg3178re: father-in-law genesis experience [carolinabob]        from looking at the consumer guide automotive page that you refrenced, it looks as though they have a spot reserved for the genesis coupe and mistakenly put 'info' on a 2010 genesis sedan.	1
	the coupe should be on the ground in the spring, but don't expect the 2010 sedan until fall of next year.	1
	by the way, the genesis 'school' is kind of a joke.	1
	i went to it, and have been to a bunch of these things.	1
	it is nice to get to drive a new car before it hits the dealership, but in terms of real product knowledge, these 'schools' are no substitute for doing your homework (i couldn't resist) when the car gets to the stores.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3179#msg3179re: father-in-law genesis experience [jeffreid]        you obviously don't have a clue!	1
	if you did, than you would know about the training hyundai corp. is doing with it's dealer network in the us.	1
	some sales people learn something and others don't.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3180#msg3180re: father-in-law genesis experience [mn778]        i don't have a clue?	1
	i've been with hyundai for almost 10 years and have been to every single new model training session that they have offered in that time.	1
	i would think that this would qualify me as having a clue.	1
	the training that these sessions offer is so dumbed down that you really aren't getting the kind of info that premium car shoppers are looking for.	1
	the people that are going to be able to effectively explain the new-to-hyundai features on the genesis are the ones that are actively researching the car, reading the manual and checking out the online news and reviews.	1
	sorry to have my feathers ruffled mn778, but until i tell you that you don't know anything about your job, i would prefer that you didn't tell me that i don't know anything about mine.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3182#msg3182re: v-8 availability [schlute]        i recall reading a post that said the genesis 4.6 would not be available in the states for at least 2 more months.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3183#msg3183re: father-in-law genesis experience [jeffreid]        i don't think mn778 realized that you're a manager at a hyundai dealership.	1

	as long as hyundai continues to settle for mediocrity in dealer quality your father-in-laws experience will be the rule rather than the exception.	1
	building the product is one thing, penetrating the market at the point of purchase is where hyundai has made the classic blunder.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3185#msg3185the genesis is a great product        the genesis is a great product but unfortunately it will likely never be enjoyed or accessed by the avg.	1
	targeted buyer because of the badge.	1
	this is just the way it is because the dealership staff don't even know the basics of how to sell cars(they do need to be sold!!).	1
	i was at a dealership looking at their genesis recently and asked a dealership employee what kind of traffic the genesis was drawing.	1
	he wasn't sure.	1
	how could you not be sure?	1
	you spend 55 hours a week there, you have just receive a brand-and market-altering product and you're 'not sure'.	1
	it gets worse.	1
	i went out to walk around the genesis they had and there happened to be a middle-aged man peeking in the window of the car.	1
	i could tell it was the first-time he had every seen or heard of a genesis.	1
	he was obviously very curious as he walked around the car and was now intent on looking closer.	1
	unfortunately, not one salesman would even open the door and let him inside (why was it locked anyway!?).	1
	he then got in his avalon and drove away after looking at an azera.	1
	again, if i was the salesperson, i would've been all over that.	1
	he was driving an avalon, his body language signaled interest, he had time to 'land' and he didnt' need to be 'slowed down'.	1
	not one of those pseudo-customer service employees, posing as self-employed salesman understood the dynamics of a sale or even understood 'planting a seed', taking time to build a rapport with a potential client, providing the client with strategic product knowledge or 'letting them out easy' if the sale wasn't then and now.	1
	my bet is that the guy will go buy another avalon, and that is too bad because the genesis is more than a viable contender.	1
	even more sad is that the guy was in buying mode and not one of those pcse's even saw it.	1
	their and hyundai's loss!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3186#msg3186re: the genesis is a great product [prosource1]          i was at a dealership looking at their genesis recently and asked a dealership employee what kind of traffic the genesis was drawing.	1
	he wasn't sure.	1
	how could you not be sure?	1
	you spend 55 hours a week there, you have just receive a brand-and market-altering product and you're 'not sure'.	1
	'i'm not sure' can be interpreted as 'bad'.	1
	that's a universal code.	1
	i'm hoping that hyundai dealerships have improved since my experience leasing my azera back in march/2006.	1
	it was not good.	1
	but i did find one hyundai dealership in another city that was excellent and that's where i would go again if i decide to pull the trigger on the genesis.	1
	but my experience has been that good hyundai dealerships are few and far between.	1
	i think if i wait until the 2010 model is released, pricing will stabilize and some of the possible issues found with the 2009 model will be corrected and i think they'll be adding some new features such as adaptive cruise control, etc.	1
	i figure they'll have information on the 2010 in about nine months.	1
	my azera only has 20,000 miles right now, so i'm in no hurry.	1
	and you never know, come next summer/fall, they may blow out the 2009s by offering a $6,000 discount or so and i'll just decide to get a 2009.   lots of influential factors involved.	1
	it's quite a volatile market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3187#msg3187re: the genesis is a great product [prosource1]        this is what i have been saying all along.	1
	i guess hyundai corporate is partially at fault here.	1
	someone posted earlier that they  work in sales for a hyundai dealer and the training by 'corporate' for the genesis was a joke.	1
	it seem the azera is suffering because they don't know hot to sell a 25k to 30k car.	1
	much less a $40k one!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3188#msg3188re: the genesis is a great product [chuck1]        a poor salesman would not keep me from buying a car that i wanted.	1
	when i know what car i want i will go and buy it on my terms or as close to that as i can get.	1
	i don't require someone to 'sell'  it to me.	1
	a really good salesperson can win you over and possibly cause you to buy something you don't want or pay more for something you do want.	1
	with a poor or inexperienced salesperson you are more in control of the transaction and this can work to your advantage.	1
	as a matter of fact i would think that a really good salesperson will recognize the type of person he is dealing with and adapt his behavior to that person.	1
	he may appear to be very knowledgeable to some or dumb as a rock to others.	1
	some of these guys and gals are very good at what they do.	1
	some are not.	1
	just my opinion and i could be wrong.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3189#msg3189re: the genesis is a great product [houdini1]        i agree with you houdini1!	1
	it's all about the car... not the salesman, the dealership, or the 'experience'.	1
	i'm a 'car guy' and pretty much know more then the saleman before i even set foot in the dealership.	1
	when i got my first saab, for example, the salesman didn't know how to put it into reverse so i showed him.	1
	when i test drove the new vovlo s40 when it first came out the salesman didn't know you could tap the turn signal to make it blink 3 times.	1
	for me the salesman is a necessary evil you have to deal with, but in the end it's about the car.	1
	just my 2 cents!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3190#msg3190poor sales reps        the problem i had was that the poor sales reps couldn't run the lease software and couldn't give me a decent deal.	1
	i agree that most informed people don't need anybody to 'sell' them on a vehicle, but they at least need to know how to sell a vehicle.	1
	three out of the four hyundai dealerships that i went to were either totally inept to complete a simple transaction or they were way overpricing the vehicles.	1
	i wouldn't go back to those dealerships at all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3191#msg3191re: poor sales reps [ricwhite]        your situation is entirely understandable.	1

	if was only about 'the car' and not the experience-then you could sell mercedes and lexus out of a barn in the middle of  a field somewhere.	1

	but the genesis v8 are located at central new jersey and baltimore / dc area.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3194#msg3194re: poor sales reps [ricwhite]        i agree.	1
	after 3 dealers in south florida, i can tell you that, among other problems, they simply don't understand leasing at all.	1
	they don't know know how to negotiate a lease deal, and they don't even know how to explain the numbers that come out of their leasing system.	1
	when i  ask a question, they simply look at the computer printout, and say 'that's what the computer says'.	1
	and, when you ask them to change something, they say' i can't, this is what the computer says'.	1
	they can't seem to grasp that the computer only tells you what you tell it say.	1
	and, that you can change the figures you enter in the computer.	1
	but, the worst experience i had so far was this past weekend.	1
	i pulled into a different hyundai dealership that had 4 genesis out in front.	1
	now, i am 58 years old, i dress well, and i pulled up in a cadillac.	1
	i told the salesman i wanted to test drive a genesis.	1
	he said  'you realize that the genesis is very expensive.	1
	are you sure you can afford it?'	1
	i was a little annoyed, but i said 'yes'.	1
	then i said i would like to drive the base model and a premium plus to compare the ride on the different tires.	1
	he then said ' you know there is a big difference in the price, are you sure you can afford it?'	1
	ok, so know i'm really getting annoyed.	1
	i told him not to worry about my finances, and could we please get on with the test drives.	1
	well, we drove them and i loved the premium plus and the color combo they had.	1
	so even though this was not the closest dealer to me i figured i would start negotiations for a lease.	1
	i had a check in my pocket, ready to close a deal.	1
	i started by telling him i would not pay the $3000- dealer add-on.	1
	i also tried to explain that it is a turn-off to me as a customer when a dealer adds on a second sticker, and that alone is usually enough to make me walk.	1
	his reply was ' well then, why don't you just walk?'	1
	i bit my tongue and continued.	1
	i told him i also would not pay dealer fees.	1
	he then tore up a piece of paper in a very dramatic way and said ' well i guess your not getting a car here'.	1
	so i walked away.	1
	as soon as i walked out the door, he jumped up from his seat and ran at me.	1
	i thought he was going to say something like ' why don't you wait while a get the manager', or 'maybe we can work something out'.	1
	but no, instead he hollers at me ' i knew you were a waste of time from the moment i met you'.	1
	so, bottom line, i liked the car, but probably will not get one.	1
	for those of you who think dealer experience doesn't matter, what am i supposed to think will happen if and when i need service on the car.	1
	i can't live in fear of something going wrong with the car and then having to deal with this crap.	1
	btw, this salesman was about 45 - 50 years old and claimed to have worked there for over 10 years.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3195#msg3195re: the genesis is a great product [chuck1]        well...i never once considered dealer experience in buying a car.	1
	but the same thing applies to my computer purchasing as well.	1
	some people just don't care as much.	1
	and for others, there's mercedes benz and dell.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3196#msg3196re: poor sales reps [traderj]        i'm finding it hard to believe that all the hyundai dealers have treated you so badly unless you did something to irk them so much.	1
	call me skeptical, but i thought salespeople were people like you and me who work to make money -- not waste everyones lives and losing time and money in the process.	1
	were you expecting a bad dealer experience form the get go?	1
	did you have preconceived notions of hyundai dealers and their services before you even stepped foot at one?	1
	did you expect to get an amazing deal or have great wiggle room because 'it was a hyundai' that you were purchasing?	1
	i'm wondering how much different it would be if you went with the                 exact same                attitude in leasing from another car maker like you did in attempting to lease a genesis.	1
	btw: the two hyundais i bought (2003  2006) were the best dealer purchasing experiences i've every had (fitzgerald hyundai in washington dc).	1
	i've also never had engine stalling or malfunctioning parts and the only time i had to use their emergency service (5 years/unlimited miles) was for a flat tire (ran over nail) and they took care of that without a hitch.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3197#msg3197all i'm saying....        all i'm saying is that the genesis door was locked in the middle of the afternoon and just previously to that the salesman didn't even know how to start the only genesis they had.	1
	this dealership and the sales manager was not preparing his staff for the day.	1
	when in sales, i literally spent hours combing the car and the materials i rec'd from corporate to prepare myself for my 'ups'.	1
	this dealership in saint john lost a sale because he didn't do any of this.	1
	he probably figured cars selling cars is 'easy money' and the cars sell themselves.	1
	or it could be that he was just never mentored or trained.	1
	having worked with people all my life is sales, business and social svcs., the (people) skills req'd to sell a $20k sonata and a $40k genesis are not that different.	1
	i personally believed that every one of my 'ups' deserved my very best b/c i asked them to fill-out a survey later where i wanted all 10's for the additional $125 i received from hyundai per car.	1
	i always got all 10's.	1
	i earned them and asked my clients for them as well as referrals.	1
	over the years i rec'd several job offers from other dealerships, a pharmaceutical giant but eventually started my own business.	1
	the point is 'basics'.	1
	you serving people and refine and/or adjust your processes to make the 'sale'  completely professional.	1
	take time to listen to your customer and yet exercise 'control' of the process.	1
	find out what your customer wants and needs are and yet use your product knowledge to direct them.	1
	be efficient and yet slow the customer down as a product walk-around takes time and 'everything is sales'.	1
	ask the customer for 10's on the survey but always give them a gift upon delivery.	1
	and even after the car is 'burning gas' and down the road, call the customer, while their on the way home and leave a message thanking them for their purchase.	1
	it's hard to employ such things and not make $150,000/year and have loads of return and referral clients.       	1

	salesman: well we dont have it here (no apologies)                                me: ok lets test drive genesis...i saw one standing outside                salesman: are you sure..its probably too rich for you!!!	1
	at this point manager comes out...tries to imitiall get $500 to get the car on the lot for me to test drive                then drops the $500.00 to zero                                then he said how about genesis..                at this point i told them i have had enough and left.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3200#msg3200re: poor sales reps [sanjaysdca]        wow...it's so sad that all these dealer experiences are so widely varying.	1
	my dealership experience for the genesis was very pleasant.	1
	salesman was very knowledgeable, admitted when he didn't know something (and made notes to beef up his knowledge on those areas) and they let me test drive the car even though i told them up front i wasn't buying (as i was waiting to see how the the v8 model was).	1
	drove car for 10-15 minutes, had me intentionally take it over bad roads (so i could see the suspension) and spent 20-30 minutes sitting in the car playing with the electronics.	1
	on a side note; it somewhat sucks that the genesis has to be either on or off.	1
	we had to sit with the motor idling the whole time because the start/stop button didn't allow for only electronics to be on without the motor.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3201#msg3201re: poor sales reps [xj220]        if your going to participate in this forum, then i suggest you show some respect to your fellow participants and take what they say at face value.	1
	maybe i should just post how hard i find it to believe that you had 2 good experiences at hyundai dealerships.	1
	maybe you just don't ask questions, don't negotiate, and are just grateful someone was willing to sell you a car.	1
	there are 2 ways to make a sale.	1
	you can either be informative and polite, or you can use intimidation.	1
	it seems to me that the hyundai dealers i have visited are using the intimidation method.	1
	i have shopped many brands over the last 2 weeks, with my wife, and we have been surprised at how accomodating most delerships were.	1
	i am sure it is a reflection of the bad economy and slow sales.	1
	almost all were courteous and several offerred to let us take the car out on our own, without a salesman.	1
	a cadillac dealer even offered to let me take the car home overnight.	1
	i didn't, because i didn't want to feel obligated to buy the car.	1
	but, i did take it home for a couple of hours to drive my wife around.	1
	bottom line, i'm glad you had a good experience, but don't assume that yours was typical or that i have some type of agenda against hyundai.	1
	if you read my post, you would see that i said i liked the car so much, i wanted to make a deal right there on the spot.	1
	i am not a brand snob, and in fact i have taken some slack from friends and relatives when i told them i was considering a hyundai,       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3202#msg3202re: poor sales reps [speedbump47]        i think its like any service industry.	1
	there are bad apples.	1
	its the ratio of bad to good that matters.	1
	week later i went to heller hyundai  ford in escondido...to make sure that the experince is comparable i decided to wear same clothes, drove in same car (infiniti i), and around same time (lunch time on friday)                                i must say that i got extremely good treatment.	1
	salesman was knew the car very well, not pushy, let me drive for however long i wanted to (laster for 20 min).	1
	knew when to speak and when not to speak.	1
	so it a sales person dependent....                                sanjay       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3203#msg3203re: poor sales reps [speedbump47]        just hit the start button two times to turn on power without starting the engine....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3204#msg3204re: poor sales reps [xj220]        xj220...don't find it too hard to believe.	1
	i was apalled to hear so many folks posting about negative experiences, however...once you start asking questions you find that most of the time, it's the only hyundai dealer within an hour's drive away.	1
	so they figure they are the only game in town, take it or leave it.	1
	that's not to say that there aren't a few bad apples out there in areas where multiple hyundai dealerships can be found.	1
	i see you're from the dc metro area (as am i).	1
	alexandria hyundai, fairfax hyundai, ken dixon hyundai have all been great a customer service.	1
	pohanka, which is in my back yard, has a long history of being terrible and i don't even go there.	1
	maybe they've changed, but with the great experiences i've had at ken dixon and alexandria...there's no need for me to go to pohanka.	1
	i also had heard that college park left a lot to be desired by many folks.	1
	with your posting that fitzgerald offers good customer service...i'll keep that one in mind.	1
	salespeople are supposed to be like you and me, but then again...they are not.	1
	just because you're a salesperson, doesn't mean you're good at your job or understand what it takes to be good at it.	1
	that is why you have great salespeople and then the not-so-great salespeople.	1
	some understand that they must be knowledgable about the products they sell in order to be really good at it.	1
	some take the stance that a customer can find out everything by going online, and let the car sell itself.	1
	those are the very ones that lose sales...regularly.	1
	you've indeed been lucky in not having any problems with either of your hyundai vehicles.	1
	i've had a '02 sonata that i had for 4 years and put 105k miles on it...loved that car, but needed a bigger one.	1
	the sonata was traded in for my '06 azera.	1
	the sonata went in for a few various items (all covered by warranty of course), but nothing ever left me stranded.	1
	the azera has been great, the only real problem (which is more of a nuisance) is the airbag light that keeps coming on (hopefully to be fixed when the part comes in).	1
	i too have never had the stalling engine, failing brakes or anything of that nature...not even the suspension problem a lot of azeras have complained about, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.	1
	it wasn't until i found out that they changed parts after initial production began which explains why i don't have the suspension problem and a lot of folks do.	1
	i say all this to say, never discount somone else's experience because you don't walk in their shoes to know what they have dealt with.	1
	be thankful that you haven't had the issues you read about and post about your great experiences so someone that lives in this area can see that and possibly go to the same place you did to get that very same good service.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3205#msg3205re: poor sales reps [speedbump47]        i thought i might be able to answer a few questions i see posted here.	1
	v8's should be hitting any day now.	1
	i am supposed to have mine this week and am very excited to have it.	1
	black on tan with tech.	1
	i think i am going to get the windows tinted and charge $999 for it..............okay, i'm kidding about the $999 part.	1
	$199 actually.	1
	since i am in arkansas, and that is sort of the middle of the country, i would assume that most other dealers would have their cars pretty soon as well.	1
	i have seen some posts here that maintain some dealers having v8's currently, but when i check the locator, it sayd that there isn't one in the country.	1
	not sure what's up with that.	1
	by the way, you can turn on the accys without the motor.	1
	press the start button with your foot off of the brake.	1
	press once for the basic radio functions, and press twice for air, windows, moonroof, and everything else.	1
	pressing a third time will turn everything off.	1
	my eyes are starting to cross from 5 hours of genesis competitive comparisons.	1
	i think i need a nap!!	1
	if the stories i see here are true about the 'are you sure you can afford this?'	1
	questions, i pity the people shopping at those stores.	1
	now, i agree that                 most                of your accent and elantra customers probably can't afford a genesis, but why would you start with that sort of a question?	1
	as long as joe consumer will sign the docs and a lender will give him a loan, what do you care if he can afford it?	1
	a sale is a sale.	1
	all i can come up with is maybe that dealer is having a bunch of weak salespeople who don't understand how to explain, in an intelligent manner,  the rather complex math of a $36000 car having a higher payment that a $16000 car.	1
	i dunno.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3206#msg3206re: all i'm saying.... [prosource1]        there are poor dealerships out there, but in my many years of  purchasing cars, i have never let a rude or ignorant salesperson defer me from the car i wanted.	1
	just ask for the sales manager and he'll probably be prone to make a better deal becuase you had problems.	1
	one problem with all dealerships is that there are way too many models, option packages, model levels, etc.	1
	for them to keep up with.	1
	when you factor in that many dealerships carry cars from several manufacturers, it is impossible for sales people to keep up.	1
	the high turnover among them only adds to it.	1
	some dealerships have one 'internet sales person' for several makes of cars.	1
	also, people who use sites such as this always know more than 90% of the salesmen out there about the cars.	1
	we have researched 4 or 5 cars to the max, whereas they need to know about every new model on the lot plus possibly the used cars.	1
	btw, i have never sold cars and never would want to.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3207#msg3207re: poor sales reps [cbrturbo]        really?	1
	wow...wish i had known.	1
	i accidently turned it off completely trying to save gas and the salesman just said 'don't worry about it...the dealership owner pays for the gas anyway'.	1
	so either he didn't know about that feature or didn't care about the car idling the whole time.	1
	thanks for the info though; glad that it's possible.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3208#msg3208re: all i'm saying.... [carolinabob]         one problem with all dealerships is that there are way too many models, option packages, model levels, etc.	1
	for them to keep up with.	1
	when you factor in that many dealerships carry cars from several manufacturers, it is impossible for sales people to keep up.	1
	try keeping up with several                 hundred                products, with an almost infinite number of configurations, as i and others in my profession do.	1
	i don't buy that there are too many models etc.	1
	for a new car salesperson to keep up with.	1
	they aren't working with customers all the time.	1
	they can use that time to research the products they sell.	1
	at the least, they can know where to get detailed information, so that when a customer asks a question they don't have the answer to, they can say, 'i'm sorry, i don't know the answer to that, but if you have a minute we can go over to my desk and i'm sure i can find the answer for you.'	1
	i don't think that is asking too much of a car sales professional.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3209#msg3209re: poor sales reps [xj220]        i don't find it hard to believe at all.	1
	as a matter of fact i came across something very interesting-i googled 'demographics of a hyundai buyer' and came up with a report published for the rab convention.	1
	(radio association broadcasters.)	1
	on page 20 it states-for hyundai                median income $59,000.00                reasons for buying 1) warranty 2) price/value dead last reputation of dealer.	1
	so if the customers don't care about the dealers-why should the dealers?	1
	i don't think any of these hit on someone who is going to buy a $40,000.00 car.	1
	for example, while warranty is important-it is not the top reason someone would look at a 40k car.	1
	http://www.scarborough.com/press_releases/scarborough%20rab%20automotive%20study- %20final%20b%202.07.pdf                                it's on page 20.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3210#msg3210dealerships        i've been to lexus, pontiac, ford, chevrolet, vw, acura, and hyundai dealerships and for me, the hyundai dealerships were the worst of the bunch with 3 out of the 4 i dealt with being bad.	1
	the one that was good was very good, however, and would compete very well with any of the other best of the best dealerships of any brand.	1
	i am a very mild mannered and non-confrontational person, yet i was told to leave the first hyundai dealership because i wanted the advertised lease deal and tried to get them to do it.	1
	as i was leaving, the manager said, 'you will not be able to lease the azera for under $500/mo', to which i replied simply, 'i guarantee you i will lease it for under $400.'	1
	the second hyundai dealership was in another city and i made an appointment because they said on the phone they 'would' be able to honor the advertised lease deal.	1
	i drove the hour to the dealership for the appointment only to find the 'lease guy' was off that day and nobody else knew how to run the software.	1
	drove all the way back home and didn't get a phone call for about a week and then they said they could only do a lease about $100 above the advertised lease deal.	1
	cross off.	1
	it was very obvious when i stepped in the third dealership that i was in trouble.	1
	they lied about the azera 'invoice pricing' (a very bad sign) and then they had some really weird add-on costs such as a 'dealer name fee' of $350 for the privilege of putting 'ken garff' on the building.	1
	i ran from that place.	1
	fourth dealership was a charm and i was able to get the lease deal ($299/mo + tax).	1
	i emailed the first dealership who told me i wouldn't be able to lease for under $500 and told them of my deal.	1
	no response, of course.	1
	so, for me anyway, it's not at all hard to believe these supposed horror stories regarding hyundai dealerships and, no, i don't think the customer is causing the problems.	1
	i just think a higher percentage of hyundai dealerships suffer from incompetence than the norm.	1
	if any salesperson told me 'are you sure you can afford this vehicle', i would be offended.	1
	that to me is actually a character insult.	1
	i would normally be surprised to read that that happened, but after my experiences, i'm not surprised.	1
	i say, search and find a good hyundai dealership and stick with them.	1
	depending on where you live, you may have to search more than usual with hyundai, but they're out there.       	1

	also  is there a regional office and phone number in the event  of a dispute with a dealer ?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3213#msg3213the paradigm of sales        'one problem with all dealerships is that there are way too many models, option packages, model levels, etc.	1
	for them to keep up with.	1
	when you factor in that many dealerships carry cars from several manufacturers, it is impossible for sales people to keep up'.	1
	let me chime in here to comment on 'keeping up' on product knowledge.	1
	first, i'm not quite sure you understand, by this comment, the occupational paradigm of a successful automotive salesperson.	1
	i'll guarantee if they are successful they come to work everyday with the perspective that they are a                 self-employed small businessperson                who just happens to have a desk in a dealership.	1
	they are not an 'employee' of the dealership, well, at least they don't think that way.	1
	this makes a world of difference in how they present themselves, treat their clients and operate their business.	1
	if a sale is going to happen, they know it's b/c they initiated and followed thru on it with their knowledge and skills.	1
	the dealership issues are mere peripherals in the sales process, the greatest being advertising.	1
	successful salespeople know that they must not only know their product, but the competitions.	1
	as a salesperson, i knew that my product hat 5 years unlimited roadside with a hotel, food allowance, towing and accident bond, as long as it was  50 miles from home.	1
	my competitors didn't.	1
	i knew that my product had 5-stars on side impact and my competitor had 3-stars.	1
	i knew my product had far superior piezo microelectric processors, 4 channel abs and my my competition didn't spend the extra money on the processors and the abs was 2 channel.	1
	i also knew why 4 channel was better than 2.                                it was my responsibility as a self-employed sales professional to arm myself with knowledge.	1
	so to say 'there are way too many models' for your salesperson to understand is simply not understanding the profession and believing that we're all just 'not up to it'.	1
	i was not only 'up to it', but made it my own business to ensure every 'up' was all it could be.	1
	not only should your salesperson know his product and every product on the lot, but he should know every single competitors model.	1
	why?	1
	salespeople have slow times and have ample time to enhance their product knowledge, read professional development materials, follow-up on clients or gain new referrals from clients they have.	1
	you should expect your salesperson to be a consummate professional when you are making the second highest purchase of your life.	1
	they should be able to tell you anything you need to know about the product you are interested in, and the competitors too.	1
	and if their good they'll sell you are vehicle.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3214#msg3214dealership experiences        i hope everyone will consider dropping by our                 dealer ratings  reviews                page and leaving reviews of all the places you've experienced.	1

	for them to keep up with.	1
	i have to disagree with that statement...as easy as it is for the many of us to post all day long and talk about the various cars that are compared to the genesis.	1
	hyundai has 9 vehicles that are sold in the u.s.  all cars share the same basics, it's the features that separate them.	1
	one secret a car salesman told me was, he got to know the top of the line trim of each model that way he knew everything that each vehicle could have.	1
	after that, it was just about remembering which trims didn't come with certain things.	1
	it's really not that difficult to keep up with the cars when you see them on a daily basis.	1
	heck, each car is practically a cheat sheet when you look at it.	1
	i guess when you get sales people that would rather watch movies on their pc during business hours, as opposed to spending a few moments getting aquainted with product...you fail the customer and yourself (as a salesperson).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3216#msg3216re: poor sales reps [traderj]        i didn't say i didn't believe you had a bad experiences, or that you're here to bring a bad name to hyundai.	1
	what i'm wondering is if you came in there with preconceived notions that you were going to get a better deal than they could have possibly offered you.	1
	or you had preconceived notions that were going to be worse than your experiences with other dealers, simply because they were hyundai dealerships.	1
	or maybe you came in there a little too demanding or not as friendly.	1
	i'm not trying to disrespect you.	1
	the reason i'm playing the devil's advocate is because, just maybe, there's something different you could've done to get the car, which is the actual purpose.	1
	a positive attitude comes a long way in making a deal, and that accounts for                 both                parties, even you the consumer.	1
	(and i'm saying 'attitude' to include all mannerisms, not implying that having a negative attitude means that someone is mean or rude.)	1
	with the right attitude you can get just about any stranger to treat you nicely, even if you walk away without buying their product.	1
	believe it or not, i'm trying to provide some constructive criticism...but i couldn't really tell if you were on this board to ask us for advice on to actually purchase a genesis or if you just wanted to vent about your recent bad experiences.	1
	btw: i've worked in customer service (membership services, restaurant business, helpdesk) long enough to tell you that even i've been rude to consumers myself, but only in extreme cases.	1
	i'm not a bad or mean spirited person, but even the most sane man can take so much.       	1

	other than a shudder in the steering at highway speeds due to misalignment, i came away extremely impressed.	1
	i tend to agree with many of the comments in this discussion regarding dealers' general lack of cache when it comes to marketing/selling this luxury sedan when it is parked next to a fleet of accents, but once a person gets past this he/she will find an outstanding value for the price.	1
	reliability is still an unknown, and i'll admit that my sf isn't perfect as i've had to have a few first-year bugs worked out (expect the same thing will happen to some of the first genesis buyers) but i'm also very particular and i take it in for things most others would not even notice.	1
	i like the style, performance, price and general fit and finish of my sf so much that i'd take a chance on the genesis were i in the market right now.	1
	i recommended a 2006 azera to my mom and a 2009 sonata to my brother-in-law and both are extremely pleased.	1
	overall, i think hyundai has a winner with this car and a very bright future too.	1
	they have come a long way from 22 years ago, when i attended the houston auto show and there were tent cards scattered over the lowly excels stating, 'hyundai (rhymes with sunday)' because nobody knew how to pronounce the brand.	1
	ironic how the tables have turned with the other automotive giants taking a serious interest in this automaker these days and, as others have noted, probably worrying quite a bit.       	1

	in today's luxury market, i think (my opinion) that most people would expect to see wood or high quality plastic wood on the dash.	1

	my only issue with the leather on the dash is that it only comes in that one color.	1
	it would be nice if they offered a gray or black to contrast the gray and black interiors as well.	1
	as far as the high quality plastic, have you seen the base model genesis...it has the faux wood on the dash in place of the leather that the premium package (and up) get.	1

	[carolinabob]         several of the luxury models out there continue to have plastic wood on the dash and door trim.	1
	no doubt, but there's plenty of non-luxury cars that have the plastic wood as well.	1
	the point is...the 'wood' look isn't just for luxury any more.	1
	real wood...well, that's a different story, but even at first glance (unless the faux wood is really a bad faux), you're not gonna notice it.	1
	however, leather on the dash isn't something everyone is doing and leather is also associated with luxury.	1
	like i said earlier, it would probably be nicer if the leather on the dash came in a few more color options other than just that brown...the brown doesn't go with everything.	1
	as far as what looks better concerning leather vs. wood (real or faux) it's subjective thing.	1
	personally, i like the change of pace and the brown leather dash really looks slick  when it's with the black interior and you choose the brown seats!       	1

	[carbunt]        it looks like it's for the middle east market.	1
	they get more options than we do here.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3262#msg3262re: picture posting of problems [ksmigel]         if you don't mind me asking, what was the problem that caused you to determine the genesis wasn't for you?	1
	it was back in early august.	1
	my local dealer (florida) had yet to get their fist car.	1
	i was on vacation in scottsdale, arizona.	1
	went into the dealer (supposed to be the biggest hyundai dealer in arizona) and they had 4 genesis (all premium or premium plus).	1
	i test drove the one the sales manager had just driven onto the lot.	1
	it was 110 degrees out and the low fuel light was on.	1
	i drive an 08 lexus gs350 at home and had a cadillac dts rental.	1
	i don't know if it was due to the heat or the low fuel, but let me tell you the car i drove was anything but fast.	1
	even the dts felt peppier than the genesis.	1
	most cars today are tuned where you only need a small amount of throttle to make the car scoot from a standing start.	1
	well the gensis is not tuned like that.	1
	it felt quite lethargic off the line.	1
	at one point the salesman told me to put my foot into it (i already was).	1
	when i test drove the 09 maxima the salesman told me to slow down and keep the rpms under 4000 - i was already using much less throttle in the maxima.	1
	the other negative was the steering felt very heavy.	1
	i was really surprised.	1
	much heavier than any other car i can remember.	1
	i will admit the sound isolation is first rate.	1
	i was also not impressed with the lexicon audio.	1
	definitely does not compare to the mark levinson on the lexus.	1
	i will try again at my local dealer when they get the v8.	1
	i will try both the v6 and v8 back to back.	1
	i had really hoped i would be happy with the car because the price is very attractive ($42k for loaded v8).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3263#msg3263re: gas mileage [sthede]        i live in arizona.	1
	we drove from phoenix area to the grand canyon last sunday averaging about 80-85 mph for most of the trip.	1
	i averaged 30.1 mpg and saw as high as 33.2 mpg during the trip while on cruise control.	1
	not that it made a difference but i was running 92 octane premium.	1
	around town i'm getting around 22.8 to 24.5 mpg most of the time.	1
	my 3.8l genesis has 2250 miles on it now and seems to be breaking in well.	1
	no real complaints or problems.	1
	thought i'd share my experience.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3265#msg3265re: picture posting of problems [stanco]        my toyota rav4 has the patches in front of the rear wheel well.	1
	it may just be showing up on more cars to cut down on gravel damage.	1
	oct. car and driver had a review of the genesis and they had complaints about the ride.	1
	i also questioned it in the two that i drove.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3266#msg3266re: genesis problems [prosource1]        car was swapped with another dealer as they did not have my color.	1
	my dealer was paramus hyundai in paramus,nj.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3268#msg3268v8  v6 back to back test drive impressions        finally, i  got to drive v8 at the local discover genesis event, unfortunately it was in a festival located in very busy city streets, this translated to a limited city road, 35mph (posted                ), 15 minutes test drive without the direct comparison to other manufactures vehicles                .	1
	however, this had a positive effect of being able to compare the v8 directly to the v6 (test drove the v6 tech again at the event).	1
	here are some of my thoughts (mostly subjective);                                - the v8 steering is even more composed than that of the v6.	1
	- the v8 is definitely stiffer that v6, which in my opinion translates ; if one thinks that the v6 is too bouncy one could consider waiting for the v8.	1
	- the v8 added power was evident even at those limited speed.	1
	- at 4000+ rpm the v8 emitted a rather pleasing exhaust note, while the v6 you heard the engine (strange as it may be... the v8 exhaust note reminded me of my old cars, a euro spec 92 supra twin turbo minus the whining).	1
	- the suspension was simply superb, nicely balanced and evened out most if not all of the city bumpy roads.	1
	i not sure because these event cars are better tuned or what?	1
	but the suspension on the v6 i drove there was better balanced than the one i drove at the dealership!!	1
	(tire pressure?	1
	more miles on these cars?	1
	i dont know!).	1
	personally i feel it was definitely worth waiting for the v8 (especially fuel efficiently does not play a large factor due to my  limit daily commute)                                other notes;                                - this time i had a usb full of varied 384k encoded (high quality) music, pop, jazz, classical etc.. the playback was simply excellent to say least, the equalizer functions were first rate.	1
	- the leather is much better on the v8 than the v6 (to quote the mrs. it is not like the 2008 bmw 530i, but at a price difference of 17.5k i am....                )..                - the driver seat cooling works nicely and i think will be a very useful feature around here...                                additional unofficial notes;                                * the v8 is on target to be delivered to dealers around the first week of october.	1
	* the allocation numbers will be dealer dependant.	1
	* the least deal is most likely extended well into october.       	1

	are they actually 'issues' or are they complaints about soft or hard rides?	1

	the most impressive thing i got out of it was the fact the engine only turns 2150 rpm at 80 mph.	1

	you don't think, quite possibly...the fact that you're driving at 80-85 mph has anything to do with it...do you???	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3286#msg3286re: gas mileage [allmet33]        i think sthede is more concerned with the fact that another poster (deeelzdoc) stated he/she drove that same average speed but got 30+ mpg.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3287#msg3287re: gas mileage [speedbump47]        wow...if that's the case, that car needs to be enshrined.	1
	i haven't heard of any v-6 vehicle capable of 30+ mpg at speeds above 65 mph.	1
	heck, you won't see 30+ mpg in 4 bangers at those speeds.	1
	at 80-85, using cruise control...i was averaging about 23-25 mpg in my azera.	1
	sounds like some suspect info to me.	1
	unless...you're doing 80-85 downhill, with a stiff wind behind you and you've taken your foot off the gas pedal...then just maybe you'll briefly see that type of fe.	1
	lol       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3288#msg3288re: gas mileage [allmet33]         heck, you won't see 30+ mpg in 4 bangers at those speeds.	1
	evidently you don't frequent the accord real-world mpg thread.	1
	i wonder if some folks' expectations are shaped by the fact that the genesis is a hyundai (i.e., economy brand) rather than the fact that it's a two-ton car with 290 bhp.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3289#msg3289re: gas mileage [stephen987]        no disrespect, but i owned a 4 banger camry before and at speeds of 80+ mph...fe was in the high 20's at best.	1
	i think there's a great deal of folks that are stretching the truth a bit.	1
	hyundai really only has 3 models that are touted for fuel economy...accent, elantra and sonata.	1
	folks cry about the fe with the azera, but don't realize it's not worse than that on the maxima and only slightly worse than that of the avalon.	1
	the genesis on the other hand it actually enjoying some of the best numbers for a car of it's stature in both v-6  v-8 models.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3290#msg3290re: gas mileage [allmet33]         i haven't heard of any v-6 vehicle capable of 30+ mpg at speeds above 65 mph.	1
	fwiw on a recent road trip (south jersey to newark airport) my '06 avalon got 30.5 at a solid 74 mph for 75 miles or so.	1
	on the way home i was little heavier footed 80 - 85 and it dropped to 29.3.  this was under ideal conditions (a/c on) with light traffic and i had just filled up 1/2 mile from the highway resetting the avg mpg indicator.	1
	so it is possible under certain conditions.	1
	of course now with putting around the city all weekend and driving to the office this morning average is already down to 25.3.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3291#msg3291re: gas mileage [sthede]        you probably would get a couple more mpg using genuine gasoline.	1
	ethanol reduced my gas mileage around 10% with my 300c hemi and around 7% with my 330i (based on long trips down i-95, and pumps marked 'can contain up to 10% ethanol').	1
	it's hard to tell, but i think the ethanol prevents the 300c from switching to 4 cylinders around 70 mph.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3292#msg3292re: gas mileage [pafromfl]         but i think the ethanol prevents the 300c from switching to 4 cylinders around 70 mph.	1
	from my understanding...the cylinder deactivation doesn't work above 65 or 70 mph on any of the vehicles with the hemi and has nothing to do with ethanol.	1
	a couple of buddies i have that own cars with hemi's complained about that and feel they were duped.	1
	they said if they knew that, they wouldn't have bought it because that was one of the features they liked.	1
	if my understanding is correct, it's all based on rpm's and to maintain speeds of 75 mph on up requires higher rpm's which is too high for the cylinder deactivation to take place.	1
	don't quote me cause i'm not 100% sure, but i believe that to be the case.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3293#msg3293re: gas mileage [tenpin288]        i had the same question abpout the suspension issues being mantioned.	1
	it was also mentioned in some reviews.	1
	one review mentioned how it became erratic on all but smooth roads.	1
	i was considering this car but now im not so sure.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3294#msg3294re: gas mileage [snags]        see october car and driver re: the suspension issue for a 'professional review.'	1
	there have been others to note concerns, but most disappeared as they got beat up on.	1
	i'm hoping that hyundai will take note of reviews, etc.	1
	and take care of it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3297#msg3297re: gas mileage [allmet33]        ahem, completely straight road.	1
	i got 41 mpg at 60mph and 35+ mpg at 70mph.	1
	this is with the sonata 2009 4 banger.	1
	plenty possible to get 30+ mpg at 75 without an issue.	1
	also to note, azeras are far less fuel efficient.	1
	you're comparing 26 mpg epa estimates vs 32 mpg epa estimates.	1
	obviously you won't get nearly as good numbers.	1
	the genesis actually has better highway numbers by 1 and a better transmission.	1
	i'd expect people could get higher numbers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3300#msg3300re: gas mileage [moocow1]        what are you folks doing, resetting the fuel economy gauge after you get up to speed and are cruising???	1
	sure, if i do that in my azera, i have seen 31 mpg cruising at 65 on a nice flat, straight stretch of highway.	1
	is that a realistic number...hardly.	1
	i still contend that it's nearly impossible to see fe #'s above 30 mpg in a large sedan with a v-6 pumping out a minimum of 260 hp while cruising at 80-85 mph.	1
	that fe rating would be more believable if the car were a prius, civic, elantra or something along those lines.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3301#msg3301gas mileage        i can get 30 mpg on speeds 70 mph or under on an even highway in my azera.	1
	but that is certainly not an 'average.'	1
	i probably average about 28 highway and about 17 city.	1
	harsh stop-and-go city driving can get as low as 13-14.  since i drive about 80% in the city, i'm lucky if i get an average of 19 or so on a tank overall.	1
	still not that bad considering a large car with a 270 hp engine.	1
	i think the azera (and likely the genesis since the v6 is essentially the same engine) is better geared for highway cruising than for city driving.	1
	i would say the highway mpg is very good while the city mpg is only fair.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3302#msg3302re: gas mileage [ricwhite]         i can get 30 mpg on speeds 70 mph or under on an even highway in my azera.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3305#msg3305from autonews        i am pretty sure these were some of hyundai's goals on the genesis:                                 hyundai motor company says that its first premium sedan,                   the genesis, is changing people's minds about the brand                  .	1
	it also says its first foray away from the low-priced and long-warrantied cars that made them well-known in america                   is attracting previous owners of luxury cars.         	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3306#msg3306re: gas mileage [allmet33]        you would be incorrect.	1
	in these cases i was actually taking the number that includes getting on the freeway and getting up to speed.	1
	so yes, 40mpg...including up to speed.	1
	heck i saw it showing under 20mpg prior to getting on freeway.	1
	it's totally doable with smooth driving.	1
	i think if i reset the number during the highway run, it would probably show something ridiculous like 45mpg or more.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3307#msg3307re: gas mileage [ricwhite]        yep same thing here.	1
	i get probably 20-21 mpg in city.	1
	highway is much much better especially if you don't speed too much.	1
	it's the problem of stopping and starting momentum in a heavy and big car in the city.	1

	it took me four tries on my azera to find one that would do the advertised lease deal.	1
	oddly, all of them on the phone told me they would, but when i got to the dealer, terms changed.	1
	you can find one, but it might take a few tries.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3311#msg3311re: new lease program [ricwhite]        this is hyundai's biggest problem.	1
	the cars themselves are quite competitive, but the dealer organization hasn't yet transcended the days when hyundais were only competing with yugos and used cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3312#msg3312re: new lease program [richard124]        i visited the dealer to find out what the story was with my lease price change.	1
	in fact...there was a change in residual value for the v6 between august (when i placed my order), and september.	1
	it has gone from 66% to 63%.	1
	i saw the sheets from hyundai financial services with the program.	1
	when my salesperson called me about it he was mis-informed when he told me 59%.	1
	but the $50/mo increase is in fact legit vs. what it would have been in august.	1
	for anyone else who placed an order last month and got a lease price, and is waiting for your car...you better check with the dealer on what your sept deal will be.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3313#msg3313re: new lease program [pjkad]        so, essentially what hyundai is saying with the lower residuals is that the genesis is worth less and depreciates more than what they first thought it would.	1
	this does not bode well -- especially with leases.	1
	of course residuals are just guesses at this point since the car has no depreciation history yet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3314#msg3314re: new lease program [ricwhite]        63% is still a very good number.	1
	why?	1
	in the luxury segement, vehicles depreciate like a rock, one of the reasons for the popularity of leases in this area.	1
	63% still beats a lot of the competitors.	1
	by the way, the 66% didn't come from hyundai, it was estimated by alg, a leading provider of residual value information on products such as automotive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3315#msg3315re: new lease program [ricwhite]        or that they were intentionally being more aggresive to get some cars out on the road.	1
	a 3% change for a short 24mo timeframe is a huge impact.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3316#msg3316re: new lease program [pjkad]        if i've done the math correctly, lowering the residual by 3% increases your monthly payment by 10%.	1
	so, the deal i had been offered at $524/mo will now increase to $573/mo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3317#msg3317re: new lease program [sandy25]        i believe the correct calculation is 3% of your invoice price is the extra depreciation you are paying for, divided by 24 to get the monthly payment impact.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3318#msg3318re: new lease program [ricwhite]        i am sure the genesis is a nice car.	1
	but this is a big issue hyundai has to get over for all it's model.	1
	less than stellar resale value.	1
	you can sell a honda with 100k on it for at least $5,0000.00.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3319#msg3319re: new lease program [chuck1]        this is very true about hyundai resale value.... i inquired about trading in my 2006 sonata in for a genesis.	1
	i paid $23,000 for a loaded lx sonata w/ every available option, but the dealership only wanted to give me $11,000 for a trade-in w/ only 31k miles.	1
	i then told the dealer i am reconsidering not getting the genesis since he just proved to me that i would take a bath on it in a few years.	1
	he really couldn't rebut to that!       	1

	is hyundai that much worse?	1
	i traded my '02 sonata after 4 years  105k miles on it and got $5000 for it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3321#msg3321re: new lease program [bman900]        bman900...what trim level is your azera?	1
	i've got an '06 w/premium package it has just over 56k miles.	1
	kbb value on trade in the condition mine is in is just under $12k, if i sell it privately...just under $14k       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3322#msg3322re: new lease program [allmet33]        we recently traded an 04 sonata lx in on a new 09 sonata ltd. we bought the 04 in march 2004 for approx.	1
	$18000 (the local dealer fought us on that price, no wonder we didn't buy from him this time).	1
	we got the new sonata for approx.	1
	$19000  at fairfax hyundai and the dealer gave us $7200 trade-in for our old sonata.	1
	granted it was low miles, only 18000 mi, but it had it's share of nicks and bumps and needed some new tires so we were more than satisfied.	1
	a few years ago we would have been lucky to get 5 or 6k for it, so i would say that hyundai's resale is coming up, slow but sure.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3323#msg3323re: new lease program [allmet33]        allmet33.... i have a 2006 sonata with the lx package (3.3 litre v6).	1
	it also has every other upgrade you could buy in 06 - leather, sunroof, 17' rims, upgraded stereo.	1
	i believe the range of value from low trade to high private sale is $11,300 - $15,500.	1
	the dealer offered me $11k as a starting offer, so i probably could get them to go higher if i played hardball.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3324#msg3324re: new lease program [bman900]        my apologies, i thought you said azera.	1
	i would play hardball because they would try to get every penny out of you they could get, right?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3325#msg3325re: new lease program [allmet33]        according to news reports, resale/depreciation values for all cars except econoboxes are either in the toilet or too iffy to tell.	1
	that is why chrysler quit leasing and gm and ford limited their leasing.	1
	btw, fortune magazine reported that edmunds' is going to build its own test track and purchase 1,000 cars annually to test and go head to head with consumer reports on delivering 'unbiased' reports for purchasers while still accepting ads from manufacturers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3326#msg3326genesis is not being promoted        here in utah, there are a lot of local hyundai commercials on tv.	1
	they are all focused on the elantra, accent, and sonata.	1
	not one word on azera or genesis.	1
	in fact, i cannot remember any commercial for the azera since late 2006 in my area.	1
	none with the genesis.	1
	there are a few high profile national genesis commercials, but no local ones.	1
	also, i get a monthly newsletter from the hyundai dealership where i purchased my 2006 azera.	1
	back in march and april they had a huge talk-up on the genesis and they sounded really excited about it and said there will be more information upcoming.	1
	but may - nothing; june - nothing; july - nothing; august - nothing.	1
	i was certain that september's newsletter would at least mention the genesis, but there was nothing -- not even a 'genesis is here.	1
	come and see it' message.	1
	i think it's rather odd that these local dealerships had exciting write-ups about the revolutionary genesis back in march and april but since then haven't said a single word.	1
	even if they didn't have any in stock, you'd think they would still try to build a little interest in it.	1
	back in about april, i emailed the sales rep. i bought my azera from and told him to email me with information about the genesis when he got it.	1
	i told him i was interested.	1
	not one word and it's now september 19.                                i hope things will pick up when the v8 becomes available, but it's not looking that good.	1
	they completely abandoned the azera two years ago.	1
	i think they are focusing their limited resources on what they think will sell -- the economy vehicles.	1
	it's all about money and right now they apparently don't think the azera or genesis (or the suvs for that matter) are worth promoting at all.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3327#msg3327re: genesis is not being promoted [ricwhite]         there are a few high profile national genesis commercials, but no local ones.	1
	and that is a problem... how?	1
	would the locally-produced genesis commercials be better in some way than the high-profile national ads?	1
	every weekend i see the genesis highlighted in ads by local dealers in the newspaper.	1
	the azera and veracruz are usually mentioned also.	1
	so they haven't given up on selling their 'big iron.'	1
	most dealers around here don't bother to advertise elantras any more, since there's maybe a dozen in the entire metro area until the 2009s arrive.       	1

	so you think your 04 sonata has appreciated $1,000 - $2,200 in the last 2 years?	1
	i dont think so.	1
	the only cars breaking even (probably still not appreciating) are the prius hybrids and the diesel vw's.	1

	a simliar situation a few years ago for a 4-5 yr old sonata would have netted a much lower trade-in value in relation to the original purchase price in a similar deal.	1
	the point i was trying to make is that in similar situations, you can expect to see better trade-in values now for hyundais than just a few years ago.	1
	are they in honda territory?	1
	no.	1
	but they are getting better.	1
	believe me i know cars are depreciating assets.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3334#msg3334genesis service        i've read a couple individuals complaining about hyundai service and it was apparent that they were not please.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3336#msg3336re: genesis wipers [ncc4]        does that mean that there is no snow in new england or the midwest, ohio, michigan and pennsylvania or eastern washington???	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3337#msg3337re: genesis is not being promoted [backy]          and that is a problem... how?	1
	would the locally-produced genesis commercials be better in some way than the high-profile national ads?	1
	the national genesis commercials are few and far between.	1
	local ads (including tv, radio, and newspaper) are shown daily and indicate to me what the local dealers feel is worthy of being promoted.	1
	sadly, what i am seeing is the genesis taking the same road as the azera.	1
	it is not being promoted by the local dealerships in my area.	1
	they are not even mentioning it in their ads, newsletters or emails.	1
	i think this can be blamed mostly on the economy.	1
	the local dealerships here are totally focused on 'economy' vehicles and have pretty much abandoned all advertising for suvs and the larger sedans (including the genesis).	1
	what i have observed is that back in march/april there was a lot of hype for the genesis from the local dealerships.	1
	now there is nothing at all.	1
	if you feel this is no problem.	1
	fine.	1
	but i think it's a bad sign -- especially for a brand new flagship vehicle that hyundai is trying to break into a very competitive market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3338#msg3338re: new lease program [tom17]         kbb numbers are inflated.	1
	use the calculator here at edmunds, it is much more accurate.	1
	sorry, but i have found the reverse to be true.	1
	the numbers that edmunds spits out have been wrong every time.	1
	kbb has been much more accurate than edmunds.	1
	please note, i am saying for my area.	1
	just so you know...i put the same info in using edmunds value calculator and the numbers came out even higher than what kbb gave me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3339#msg3339re: genesis is not being promoted [ricwhite]         if you feel this is no problem.	1
	fine.	1
	it is a problem i don't see any evidence of where i live.	1
	but then i live in a metropolitan area of about 2.5 million people, so per person ad cost is much lower than in utah, making it a better business proposition for local dealers to advertise the genesis... which they do--if mainly in print ads.	1
	also perhaps they sponsor the 'national' ads, on a regional basis?	1
	so they get shown more often in more densely-populated areas than in areas such as utah?	1
	i don't know if that is true or not.	1
	i am not sure what you mean by national commercials being 'few and far between', but i see more genesis tv ads than i see for mercedes, bmw, cadillac, etc.	1
	there is also all the press/reviews about genesis, which is 'free advertising' and perhaps more effective than locally-produced ads because it is in the form of a 3rd-party testamonial.	1
	hyundai may be factoring that into their marketing plan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3341#msg3341re: gas mileage [tom17]          the most impressive thing i got out of it was the fact the engine only turns 2150 rpm at 80 mph.	1
	far cry from infiniti g35/m35 that turn 3400 rpm at 80. that is why the mpg is 30 on the highway !!!	1
	as an owner of an 07 g35 (and a recent test driver of a v6genesis) i'd much rather have the instantanious throttle response available w/ the current g instead of the downshift lag w/ the extra gearing in the gen. they're different cars though, the g is much more performance oriented, the gen is more of a luxury cruiser.	1

	getting 25hwy at 85mph average in the g. btw, i got excellent mpg w/ our last hyundai (06 sonata v6) avg'd 30mpg at 80 mph, so it's definately possible (although at over 250hp it gets pretty tough).       	1

	i have tried kbb and edmunds for both greenville sc and atlanta ga zip codes and edmunds is always higher.	1

	on the other hand, i have always been able to get a car for a thousand or more less than edmunds tmv!	1

	hopefully some of the v8 ones will migrate to the v6 premium package.	1
	also, they were told emphatically that the genesis is not a                 sports                sedan despite what the brochures say.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3350#msg3350waiting impatiently        made the decision to go for it and placed my order for a v6 with tech package a few weeks ago.	1
	i was assured by the dealer that they would have my car within 3 weeks, 4 at the absolute worst.	1
	well it's been 31/2 weeks and the new story is they have no idea when they will get the car.	1
	i'm buying in canada which apparently is a tiny backwater place as far as hyundai is concerned, my dealer keeps telling me they are the largest volume dealer in canada yet they are still waing for their 4th genesis and have no idea when they will get it.	1
	i made enquiries with other dealers in the area before signing a deal and nobody has called to tell me they are getting stock either so i believe this is a corporate problem not a dealer issue.	1
	however that still doesn't change the fact that i don't have my darn car.	1
	this is the sort of thing that i would guess doesn't happen with the premium badge makes and i'm prepared to live with it for the price difference but if hyundai wants to succeed in the luxury car market they will need to improve their service level in a big way.	1
	by the way just to make you guys in the u.s. feel better, in canada we pay 10-15% more for the car (all cars) and with hyundai, we get half the warranty - 5 years instead of 10 and 3 years roadside service.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3351#msg3351re: waiting impatiently [rjwrde]        wait another six months and genesises (?genesi) will become much more available.	1
	also, the prices will drop.	1
	car dealers always try to maximize the exclusiveness of a new car to maxmimize their bottom lines.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3352#msg3352re: waiting impatiently [rjwrde]        have you seen the actual purchase order (or whatever they call it) from the dealer to the factory?	1
	if it's not an actual piece of paper, surly someone can show you a computer screen when the car was ordered?	1
	just curious.............       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3353#msg3353advertising        saw an ad this morning on msnbc or one of the cnn news programs, so hyundai is advertising it on tv.	1
	don't hold me to this, but i think it showed a $399 month with $2,000 down payment lease.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3354#msg3354re: waiting impatiently [rjwrde]        i am a korean, and worked in the korean automotive industry for a few years before coming back to the states for a graduate degree.	1
	i still keep track of things going on in korea and the industry, so what i know might be of little help to you.	1
	1) the slowdown of genesis production                the main reason i believe for the late release of the genesis is that hyundai recently went through labor strife (which is annual, by the way).	1
	after months of wrangling between the labor and the management, they finally passed the bill (of increasing wages etc etc).	1
	hence, it has been about 1-2 weeks since this went through, and i believe this is the main culprit for the sudden decrease in the genesis delivery.	1
	btw, even press cars regarding the genesis have been put on hold.	1
	i know that hmc wants to sell as many genesis as possible - they invested huge money in this and the high popularity of the genesis in korea may not be able to break even: they need genesis to sell well in na market.	1
	hence, i am sure you will be seeing an upsurge of production and will see enough v6s and v8s to go around.	1
	(2) ecu problems                another possible culprit is the reported ecu problems in korean genesis.	1
	a few cars have reported to have stalled on roads due to engine failure, which is believed not to be due to engine itself but due to ecu problems.	1
	i have heard that hmc is working on it.	1
	i personally drove the genesis at a dealer in california, and the car was very impressive.	1
	cheaper than the new audi a4 (fully loaded) and handles better?	1
	yikes, this car is good.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3355#msg3355re: waiting impatiently [priggly]        i hear what you are saying but the order is already in, so waiting another six months isn't really an option - i'm just hoping that it doesn't take six months to get the car here (lol)                                to iedwinka:                                thanks for providing your insight on the labour problems.	1
	with regard to th ecu problem, do we know if this has started showing up in cars here in north america or has it only been a problem in korea so far?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3356#msg3356re: waiting impatiently [rjwrde]        i live in new jersey and i ordered my black / saddle 3.8 with tech package on july 29th and was promised 45 to 60 days delivery.	1
	today is october 1 and no sign of my car,,,,,,,,no vin number,,,,,,,,  the dealer told me he will not have that information until it is either at the port or on the truck.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3357#msg3357re: waiting impatiently [azeraclunk]        yikes!	1
	i thought this was a canadian problem, from many of the posts on this and other sites, i had the impression that stock was starting to pile up on the dealer lots in the u.s.                                like you, my dealer has no clue when my car will arrive.	1
	until it hits the port in vancouver - for canadian imports - the dealer claims that they can't get any indication of where the cars may be or when they will arrive.	1
	no vin, no information at all.	1
	in a day and age when we can track just about anything and manufacturer's depend on 'just in time' delivery of raw materials/parts, it seems beyond comprehension that hyundai can't figure out where their 4000 lb automobiles are.	1
	i flew aircraft for a living so i know all about delays and unexpected changes to plans, but come on folks, by now hyundai should have a vague clue as to how long it takes to assemble a car, put it on an east bound boat, take it off the boat when they hit dry land and load it onto a train or truck and drive it to a destination  in north america.	1
	then if they find it appropriate to add a two or three week buffer on top of that, fine but with today's technology i just can't believe it remains a mystery to the canadian or u.s. corporate headquarters as to where their cars might be and when they will be able to deliver them to the customer.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3358#msg3358us genesis still sold well despite the economic downturn        was expecting a bad month but certainly caught my eyes when i saw hyundai outsold the gs, sts, s80, rl, 9-5, in that order (some by large margins), and only units behind the m and a6/s6 (audi combined the reporting, no breakdown).	1

	i ordered the beige exterior with the saddle brown interior and tech package - saw this colour combo in a car without the tech package and it looks great.	1
	apparently it's not a colour combo that is available in the u.s. but for some reason it is in canada.	1
	my wife could care less about the tech toys but she really liked this colour combo.	1
	my dealer is telling me that they will likely get stock first in black on black and silver with black interior.	1
	after owning one black car in our climate, i swore i'd never do that to myself again and i personally find there are way too many silver cars on the road today.	1
	i think the genesis looks great in silver but it's just not for me.	1

	black on tan with tech.	1
	man, this car will scoot!!!	1
	the thing is though, the power isn't head-snapper power.	1
	you mash the throttle and the rpm's jump up and it seems like nothing is really happening.	1
	then you look down and you're doing 100mph+ and you realize what's going on.	1
	the v8 is just so smooth.	1
	you really have to drive it to appreciate it.	1
	if you like exhaust sound from inside the cabin, and harsh acceleration, then this car is not for you.	1
	if however, you like smooth and silent, with loads of power, then hello darling!!	1
	this is the one.	1
	i was very impressed.	1
	there are 7 v8's in florida as of right now.	1
	one of them has a tech pkg.	1
	it is the dark blue with the saddle interior.	1
	anyway, if your dealer has one on order, they should have it now, or any day now.	1
	pearl white paint is a whole other story however.	1
	there is no end in sight to the delay on that.	1
	i still have a v6 w/tech sitting out there in the ether just waiting to materialize on the lot.	1
	no word on when these will get around to getting here.	1
	as far as the dealers with v6's are concerned, the packages that are out right now were ordered directly by the dealers.	1
	they probably thought that the less exspensive models would sell better.	1
	i think the other way around.	1
	if you are going to buy a $35,000 to $40,000 hyundai right now, you probably want all of the bells and whistles.	1
	all we ever sell in azera's is the ultimate package.	1
	also, most everyone that we have had come in the door and ask about a genesis has been interested in nav and the rest of the tech pkg.	1
	just seems like a car like this should have all of the goodies.	1
	now that the initial order period is over however, hma will be allocating the genesis just like they do elantra's.	1
	the dealers that are selling the cars will get the most, but they will not be able to directly order them.	1
	they will have to take what is on their allocation and hope that they get some goods colors and packages.	1

	with the low end cars the dealer seems to get several of every possible color  option combo (they show 111 sonata's on their web site).	1
	since the genesis are so rare i am sure that wont be the case.	1
	i guess that will help promote the additional markups on the popular cars?	1
	my local dealer does now show 1 v8 on their web site.	1
	i will call them tomorrow and see if it is 'real'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3379#msg3379re: total genesis sales [tom17]        but, is every hyundai us dealer selling the genesis?	1
	i don't think so.	1
	as i said earlier, it seems hyundai is moving the genesis despite every bad news coming from the economy working against the product (and other factors working against the product as well).	1
	for most dealers, i'd venture to guess the genesis isn't sitting on the lots and rotting, as some had predicted pre-launch.	1
	while the long-term scorecard and the intangible effects on the rest of the line + the brand itself are much unknown at this point, i have been impressed (and frankly, surprised) by the car since arrival.	1
	now, from a sales perspective, the genesis has entered the market and already, it has positioned itself extremely competitive against the veterans in the field.	1
	when you finished ahead of cars such as the rl, gs, s80, and within sights of the m and a6, youd call that a spirited month.	1
	of course, reaching the level of the 5er and e-class anytime soon is unlikely.	1
	on another note, with year-end approaching, the genesis should be on the short list of many reputable car of the year awards.	1
	id not be surprised if hyundai takes the honor, with this car resembling similar potential to the first ls  so far so good  hyundai is writing part ii of that story.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3380#msg3380re: waiting impatiently [tom17]        tom17, you are pretty close on your assumptions.	1
	hma will have to allocate the vehicle that you want to your dealer for them to be able to take it.	1
	however, if you know what package and color that you want, and are willing to wait a little while, you could go in and ask them to 'preference' the car that you want, and that may increase the chances that they will get the exact car that you want.	1
	if this dealer is selling a bunch of genesi, then they will most likely be able to get the car that you want.	1
	the other option would be to ask them to dealer trade one for you.	1
	however, if they are stocking 111 sonata's, then i would guess they would be able to get anything that they want from hyundai!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3381#msg3381re: total genesis sales [allmet33]         please explain what you mean by this?	1
	test drove a 3.8 tech package.	1
	from a stop, stepping on the gas resulting in a pause followed by a lurch forward.	1
	this was so appalling that when i was on the highway contemplating a move from the slow lane to the fast lane (which had plenty of traffic), i feared for my safety.	1
	i finally got up the nerve to move into the fast lane and the car did fine, with no 'gulp and lurch' at highway speed.	1
	overall, i would say my nissan pathfinder (1999) is a much smoother car at slower speeds.	1
	i asked the salesman about it and he gave me some bs about how the genesis adapts to the driver's driving style.	1
	also, i was not so impressed with the sound system.	1
	it gets such high billing i was expecting to be awed, but i couldn't tell a difference from my pathfinder.	1
	and, while the salesman told me the genesis has hd radio, the salesman couldn't get the car to tune to any digital stations (he said there weren't any, but i know they exist in fairfax, va).	1
	furthermore, i was very surprised to see three exposed speaker coils in the trunk (sort of on the roof of the trunk).	1
	i know it wouldn't take too many trips to the trail with my bike in the trunk before my bike pedals destroyed those speakers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3382#msg3382re: total genesis sales [stone13]        hmmmmm...sounds to me like the particular genesis you drove may have had an issue.	1
	a pause followed by a lurch has nothing to do with a car adapting to a driver's style at all.	1
	you're right, the salesperson fed you a load of bs on that end.	1
	i would have asked to test another one just to see if it was just that particular car that had the issue.	1
	as i stated, i tested one and take of was smooth  confident.	1
	the car doesn't snap your head back, but if you're not paying attention...you'll quickly find yourself going faster than you might expect.	1
	as far as the sound system.	1
	that's a subjective thing.	1
	i have been installing sound systems for 15+ years and there has never been any pathfinder that had a system that i would call great.	1
	if you have the bose system, then it's quite possible that you have one of the good sounding ones as bose is overrated in the automobile application.	1
	i've heard some bose systems in cars that sound like utter crap.	1
	also, since the pathfinder is yours, you've taken the time to fine tune the sound to your liking...did you take the time to do the same with the one in the genesis?	1
	someone else could have changed the settings and since we all listen differently...their settings could have sounded like junk compared to how you like to listen to music.	1
	just a thought...not too many folks have anything negative to say about how the sound system sounds, maybe that the stereo itself could be a little better in terms of operation, but nothing negative in the sound department.	1
	the speaker coils (as you call them) are not exposed as they are inside of the speaker and would be quite protected from bike pedals by the magnet that you actually see.	1
	the only way you would destroy a speaker from underneath would have to be something very slim like a spike, screwdriver or something of that nature that could be pushed up through the speaker basket (frame of the speaker) and through the actual cone of the speaker.	1
	puncturing the speaker would exactly destroy it, but the sound wouldn't be as good, but it would still play.	1
	i do understand that folks would like to see a piece that covers the underside of the deck, and they hold that against the genesis.	1
	in real life though, how often do you find yourself looking at the underside of the rear deck?	1
	i mean...unless you stand under 4' tall, or actually climb into the trunk...your'e not gonna see it too often.	1
	others, like yourself think that the exposed speaker backs mean they can be damanged much easier...that is also a misconception.	1
	try the folks down at alexadria hyundai and see if you have a different experience with the genesis.	1
	the thing i like about them is you can tell who has had training with the genesis as they have a little 'plaque' on their desk that says they have been to certified genesis training.	1
	heck, while i was there last...a couple of them were playing with the sound system to see how it interacted using a thumb drive in the usb port.	1
	i wanted so bad to tell them they could only play mp3 files from a thumb drive, not aac or wma files, but they needed to figure it out on their own.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3383#msg3383re: total genesis sales [stone13]        not sure what other cars you may have test driven, but i experienced the same sort of 'pause/lurch' in my parent's camry se.	1
	turns out it was when they switched over to 'drive by wire' and the throttle wasn't connected directly to the pedal anymore.	1
	they got many complaints on it and eventually resolved the issue through more aggressive shift management.	1
	i almost got into an accident the same way, switching over from slow to fast lane; car definitely should have had the ability to accelerate when i floored the pedal; but the 1/4 - 1/2 second pause was way too dangerous.	1
	your pathfinder is probably old enough to not have drive by wire implemented in it, which is likely why it feels more responsive.	1
	not saying the genesis isn't at fault, just trying to provide some background commentary.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3384#msg3384re: total genesis sales [stone13]         ... i know it wouldn't take too many trips to the trail with my bike in the trunk before my bike pedals destroyed those speakers.	1
	if that's an actual concern for you, then the genesis (or any other sedan for that matter) is clearly not the vehicle you need.	1
	how often do you see 1) a luxury car at a 'trail' and 2) someone put a bike in the trunk of one?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3385#msg3385re: total genesis sales [allmet33]         a pause followed by a lurch has nothing to do with a car adapting to a driver's style at all                sure it can - this being an unfortunate by-product of these newer electronic 'learning' trannies.	1
	it's actually rather simple - in an effort to maximize fe these traniies will usually be programmed to hold onto absurdly high gears keeping engine speeds to a minimum.	1
	so, therefore, when you do hit the accelaerator hard or in any manner that the computer doesn't correctly interpret what you get is a big time multiple gear downshift and the 'pause' .	1
	a number of cars suffer from this malady including my own avalon.	1
	isn't technology wonderful?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3386#msg3386re: total genesis sales [captain2]        hey captain, long time...                                anyway, so the fact that it could be a programming issue, it may not necessarily be inherent in all the vehicles, right?	1
	i understand what you're saying, but how do you account for the many folks that have driven the same car at other places and the pause  lurch haven't been mentioned?	1
	also, based on what you stated, that would be with the car already rolling, what about from a dead stop as the original poster stated that's when it happened.	1
	certainly, the tranny isn't trying to hold on to a high gear because it hasn't shifted up yet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3387#msg3387re: expert reviews for 2009 hyundai genesis [beseto]        not sure why you went to all this trouble, but you apparently cherry picked portions of the reviews or reviews themselves.	1
	a couple of the negatives.	1
	car  driver, 10/08                : 'it didn't take long on some of our favorite backroads to convince us that the decisions made by the chassis engineers in the area of spring rates and damping could benefit form a little revision.	1
	maybe more than a little.	1
	''it was not difficult to use up all of the suspension travel, yielding hard bumps and episodes of head toss.	1
	''our test car had premature upshifiting,...hyundai techs tried reflashing the computer, but to no avail.'	1
	automobile magazine, 10/08                : 'but add a few bumps, and the genesis takes a turn for the worse.	1
	the hyundai falls completely to pieces on twisty, bumpy back roads.	1
	push it hard and pavement irregularities send the genesis heaving and wallowing down the road.'	1
	i do most of my driving on twisty, bumpy back roads.	1
	the genesis is number one on my list of potential cars, but i am concerned about the above as this is similar to problems that hyundai is noted for in many of its cars, including my 2007 azera.	1
	i hope hyundai will note all these and fix them now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3388#msg3388re: expert reviews for 2009 hyundai genesis [carolinabob]        i'm really wondering if the type of driving they are doing on the twisty, bumpy back roads is the type of driving most would do regularly, or were they pushing the car as if they had a bmw underneath them?	1
	surely, the car isn't a bmw and it wasn't designed to be driven as such.	1
	there are some that argue that the genesis was touted as a luxury sport sedan, but in reality...it is nothing more than a luxury sedan.	1
	i have driven my azera on many different types of roads, from straight  smooth all the way to twisty  windy.	1
	if driven as the car should be, there really are no issues.	1
	at least in my case.	1
	i have come to find that i haven't experienced any of the suspension issues most have complained about, but...i can say that hitting uneven pavement in curves makes the car feel a bit skittish, but that's with the factory wheels  tires.	1
	when i have my aftermarket 20' wheel  tire package on...the car feels much, much different.	1
	i think that hyundai needs to be a bit more aggressive in the suspension tuning.	1
	luxury doesn't have to mean butter soft and floaty.	1
	with the smooth power that the genesis has (either v-6 or v-8), it's going to make people want to push it a little bit.	1
	i mean...what's the use of having that power if you can't really enjoy it?	1
	i tested a 3.8 and over city type streets it rode rather confidently and smooth.	1
	there was now jitterbug felt when rolling over man-hole covers, pot holes or uneven pavement in a straight line.	1
	i haven't been able to take one and drive it the way i really want though.	1
	only thing i can tell you is...get one for a test drive and hit some roads that'll give you that feel to let you know how it'll be.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3389#msg3389what bother me the most about the genesis        what bothers me most about the genesis is that i have test driven several at different dealers and have different observations each time.	1
	there is too much variance in the the quality of the ride each time.	1
	the last one i drove definitely had that lurch or surge in low gear while accelerating.	1
	it was not smooth at all.	1
	it just makes me nervous that there is too much inconsistancy.	1
	sometimes the ride was floaty, sometimes too harsh and sometimes just perfect.	1
	i drove 2 different cars at the same dealer, and even the salesman noticed the difference in the ride.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3390#msg3390re: what bother me the most about the genesis [traderj]        i would expect the harsher ride to come with the genesis with the 18' wheel package as opposed to the 17' wheels.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3391#msg3391re: total genesis sales [tayl0rd]         if that's an actual concern for you, then the genesis (or any other sedan for that matter) is clearly not the vehicle you need.	1
	how often do you see 1) a luxury car at a 'trail' and 2) someone put a bike in the trunk of one?	1
	are you implying 1) that an athletic person should not have or be seen driving an entry level luxury sedan?	1
	or 2) that a biker should bolt a bike rack to the roof instead of using the spacious trunk?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3392#msg3392re: total genesis sales [allmet33]        it actually means that the driver learns how the car wants to be driven not the other way around.. what happens in the avalon (especially 05s and 06s) is that the car holds onto a really high gear selection on coastdown from a higher speed (exiting a highway, for example).	1
	so when you hit the accelerator hard to get your speed back up,the car's computer which is electronically guessing (dbw) what you want anyway is forced to make a multiple gear downshift (6 to 2 for example) .	1
	the result a sometimes unnerving delay, hestitation or lurch as this all happens.	1
	it is a relatively new but also common problem as all these mfgrs.	1
	chase the mighty mpg, but also one that many manufacturers are finally issuing tsbs etc for - including toyota.	1
	a number of drivers  simply can't (or won't) adjust to this and in their cases they have a car that to them is even dangerous (or at least quite annoying) to drive - software or hardrware problem no matter - the end result is the same.	1
	for my part, i view this all as the car working the way it was designed however screwed up that may be, and can't help but harken back to those really undriveable powerglides and dynaflows of yesteryear.	1
	not all 'progress' is necessarily good.	1
	doesn't mean that folks shouldn't  complain about it though - quite rightfully.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3393#msg3393re: total genesis sales [stone13]        i think the implication was that people who go out to ride on the trail are more likely to do so in a vehicle that has a dedicated 'dirty space' for the bike after the ride.	1
	you know--like a pickup, or the hose-it-out variety of suv.	1
	i don't see anything in the original post that implies the moral judgment you suggest--more a matter of the types of lifestyle and image that tend to go with outdoorsy activities.	1
	i used to know a guy who habitually hauled firewood in the back of his rolls silver shadow.	1
	ruined about a grand worth of wilton wool carpet doing so.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3395#msg3395re: total genesis sales [stephen987]        correct.	1
	i wasn't implying that active people shouldn't drive luxury vehicles at all.	1
	my implication was that people that live rugged-active lifestyles typically will choose a vehicle that actually suits/supports that lifestyle.	1
	i think it's nutty to complain that a car can't do something that it                 clearly                was never intended to do.	1
	it's not the car's fault, it's your (not you in particular, stone13, but you fit the model right now) fault for making a poor decision in car selection.	1
	that would be like me complaining that i can't throw some 4'x8' sheets of plywood in the back of my 550i.	1
	if that were something that i regularly needed or wanted to do, it'd make a whole lot more sense for me to choose a vehicle more suited to that role.	1
	that's not to say that rugged-active types can't enjoy some luxury, too.	1
	they make luxury/near-luxury suvs that fit that purpose nicely.	1
	here's a short list of some that are somewhat within the price range of a nicely equipped genesis:                                vw touareg v6                acura mdx                lexus rx350                lincoln mkx(?)	1
	bmw x3                infinity fx35 (although it's utility is questionable)                toyota highlander v6                nissan pathfinder                ford flex                ford taurus x (formerly known as the freestyle)                buick enclave                gmc acadia                                i could go on with several more, but i did say a 'short list.'	1
	bottom line, though, is don't fault the car just because                 you                (stone13) chose the wrong one to fit your lifestyle.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3396#msg3396tire pressure is very very important        check the tire pressures before you guys jump in the car and test drive it.	1
	hyundai overinflates the tires that they deem is for export.	1
	one time i checked the tire press on a 08 sonata and it was like over 50psi.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3397#msg3397        tire air pressure makes a huge, huge difference in ride quality.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3398#msg3398re: total genesis sales [tayl0rd]         bottom line, though, is don't fault the car just because you (stone13) chose the wrong one to fit your lifestyle.	1
	actually, i did not choose the car -- i merely went to look at one and thought i'd share my observations with other people who might be interested in this car.	1
	the point of the observation does not apply solely to bikes.	1
	the trunk is there to be used.	1
	for example, suppose one has the trunk filled with luggage; then the young bellhop yanks out a piece of luggage only to find that the handle caught (and extracted) the speaker.	1
	or anything with a long strap could get caught.	1
	if anyone but you is pulling it out, they might not be too gentle.	1
	also, you might be interested to know that in the past my honda crx and nissan 300zx have served me well to transport my bike to the trail head.	1
	in fact, for the last 20 years, i've used trunks (and hatchbacks)  for bike transport with no trouble.	1
	when i buy my next car, which will likely be a sedan, i expect to continue doing so.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3399#msg3399re: total genesis sales [stone13]         for example, suppose one has the trunk filled with luggage; then the young bellhop yanks out a piece of luggage only to find that the handle caught (and extracted) the speaker.	1
	or anything with a long strap could get caught.	1
	if anyone but you is pulling it out, they might not be too gentle.	1
	you seem to be a bit extreme in your thinking.	1
	i mean...if someone were trying to extract something from a trunk and it wasn't coming out too easily (if at all), i would think common sense would prevail to find out what is hindering the extraction.	1
	also, maybe i'm just anal about some things, but when i pack a trunk for travelling...i make sure i pack it in such a way that handles and straps aren't going to get in the way of taking them out.	1
	oh yeah, if a bellhop were able to extract a speaker by simply tugging on some luggage that might have gotten caught up on it...i wanna meet him.	1
	he would have to be the terminator of bellhops to make that happen.	1
	the speakers are mounted in the deck in a top-mount fashion, meaning...it's dropped into a hole cut out for it in ther rear deck where a flange holds it in place and it's secured by screws, bolts or rivets.	1
	besides, if you pack the trunk of the genesis to the point stuff is smashed up against the bottom of the rear deck, then once again...you would have chosen the wrong car for you as it would seem you would need a vehicle with more luggage space...like a station wagon, mini-van, mid-size suv or cross-over.       	1

	my last two vehicles ('03 avalon, '06 avalon) have had this exact setup for the subwoofer and neither has been damaged.	1
	i have had both cars' trunks packed to the gills will no problems.	1
	it may have been mentioned before but the reason the sub is mounted this way is so the trunk acts as an enclosure for the speaker.	1
	it is what the pros call a 'free air' mount iirc.       	1

	it's the most inexpensive, inobtrusive way to add bass to a sound system because you don't have to worry about designing an enclosure for the subwoofer to be loaded into.	1
	all you have to worry about is a baffle that separates the sound waves coming from the front of the cone, from the ones coming from the back side of the sub, i.e...the rear deck.	1
	the biggest downside to this type of set up is...it's the least effecient method of producing bass and, what you put in the trunk can affect the performance of the bass as well.	1
	anyway, it is what it is, but the bottom line is...you'll damage those speakers by playing them too loud before luggage will damage them.       	1

	preferably both                 with the financial markets and the general economy in the toilet i doubt too many folks are pulling the trigger on a new vehicle right now.	1
	all new vehicles generate some intial buzz and the genesis has been well received for the most part.	1
	i wouldn't read to much into the waning interest on mesage boards, i think people just have many more things on their plate right now.       	1

	they just released the coupe over there.	1
	there is also some dyno video on that site of the turbo 4 cylinder and they have some pretty cool engine pics of the sedan.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3409#msg3409re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [colegar]        i now have, 5,200 miles on my v6 genesis and will briefly update the impressions i posted after 1,200 miles.	1
	build quality has been rock-solid.	1
	the only problem i have had was a defective battery that had to be replaced.	1
	since the dealer did not have one in their parts inventory, they had to 'steal' one from another genesis that had just arrived.	1
	i will stick with everything i posted about the suspension being too firm on imperfect roads.	1
	it corners extremely well but they tried to make it sporty strictly with firmness and there is more to the 'sporty' formula than that.	1
	this car loves good roads and is a pleasure to drive until you hit the rough stuff.	1
	and ... brace yourself if you go over a parking garage speed bump, even at one or two mph!	1
	tire pressure is a big deal on this car.	1
	i have always inflated tires one or two pounds over spec, but not on this car.	1
	just that difference exacerbates the harsh ride on bumpy surfaces.	1
	something is going on with the engine/transmission programing that has caused it to be more tricky to avoid surge during acceleration from a stop.	1
	this car was perfect in the beginning but its artificial intelligence has outsmarted itself while it has been 'learning' my driving habits.	1
	i am neither a speed demon or grandpa slowpoke but somewhere in the middle.	1
	i may have exaggerated the fuel mileage by one mpg.	1
	still good though for a car with as much usable power.	1
	i'm still ticked off that the speedometer lies to me and that hyundai claims that it is 'within tolerance' (see my original post).	1
	i am not convinced that it was not intentional on the part of hyundai, to make it look like the car is going 3-4% faster than it really is.	1
	and ... i still don't buy the fact that the odometer is completely accurate if they can't get the speedometer to be accurate.	1
	i now rate the navigation system as the best i have ever had (and i have had them all).	1
	also, they have nailed the simulated i-drive (toggle control).	1
	every menu item is simple to access and is very intuitive.	1
	that's it.	1
	good car overall with a few things that aren't perfect.	1
	still the best $40,000 luxury sedan out there!       	1

	with no exception you have nailed all the pros  cons of the genesis.	1
	on the nav however, it would have been a plus if it would actually name the approaching streets as we get to them.	1
	in my g35 the nav does that and it is great.	1

	question from post #3412:                by the way, to get off the topic for a moment, can you insert a cd in the unit and rip it into the hard drive??	1
	it is not possible to rip a cd to the hard drive.	1
	some reviewers have said that it can be done but they did not know what they were talking about.	1
	i think they had read pre-production specs which had said that it would be possible.	1
	i can assure you that the reviewers that said it could be done had never actually tried it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3413#msg3413re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [imschill]        i don't know the answer to your question about ripping a cd onto the hard drive.	1
	regarding the navi not showing upcoming street names, you are correct.	1
	for what it's worth, i have found that if i set the navi zoom to 700 feet, it superimposes the names of most streets while at the same time giving you a view of a wide enough area.	1
	i pretty much leave it set on 700 feet all the time.       	1

	you said it wasn't sold in the u.s. and i was just pointing to a source that does indeed sell it in the u.s.  my bad, i see that getting two will cost you $55 + sh.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3421#msg3421white genesi        hi gentlemen.	1
	just wanted to let everyone know that pearl white genesi should be at your local dealers any day now if they are not already there!!	1
	mine is supposed to be here tomorrow, and with arkansas being in the middle of the country, i would figure most other dealers will have their cars in as well.	1
	just sold our first (and only) v8.	1
	black on tan with tech.	1
	seems like a really great trend that i'm seeing with this car.	1
	the people that are buying are coming in not to look around and find the genesis, but coming in wanting this car and knowing the value that it represents with very little sales pitch needed.	1
	now if my salespeople can just get used to a hyundai being $42000, i think we'll be okay!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3422#msg3422one of the problems with the genesis        a big problem with buying this car is the dealership itself.	1
	since hyundai is a non-luxury marque, their dealerships are plain and entry level in design and function.	1
	the dealer told me that the company will try to upgrade hyundai to a more luxury car division with kia being marketed as the more value oriented division.	1
	in the meantime, buying the top of the line genesis will not get such amenities as a service loaner that luxury car owners have come to expect, nor do the service areas cater to the waiting luxury car customer.	1
	i looked over the car carefully last weekend and noted that the brown leather looks cheaper than the beige perforated leather and is seamed cheaply.	1
	other aspects of the car like the faux stainless panels appear out of the 80's/ 90's chrysler parts bin.	1
	still, for their first luxury car, a nice effort.	1
	after a little amount of time, lexus, cadillac, and mercedes will be have a lot to be concerned about.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3423#msg3423re: one of the problems with the genesis [carnaught]        your dealership doesn't offer free service car loaner?	1
	up here, i get free service car loaner and i only own a sonata.	1
	i think a lot of differences depend on the actual dealership, not the car maker.	1
	also, every other oil change is free and always free 23-point inspection.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3424#msg3424re: one of the problems with the genesis [xj220]         your dealership doesn't offer free service car loaner?	1
	no, mine does not.	1
	some dealerships like yours apparently do offer it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3425#msg3425re: one of the problems with the genesis [carnaught]        i think you will find that more dealers do offer loaner cars than don't.	1
	hma has a pretty good loaner program for the dealers, and so it works out to offer the service.	1
	what you will find though is that most dealers are reserving their loaners for the people that bought their cars from them originally.	1
	also, when you only have to get your car serviced twice a year (per the maintainence log), is a fancy waiting area really that big of a deal?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3426#msg3426re: one of the problems with the genesis [carnaught]        the hyundai 'powers that be' back in south korean have big plans for this company.	1
	however their plans are not founded in reality.	1
	hyundai will never become a luxury nameplate in the u.s.                                kia's customer satisfaction index generally rates at the bottom.	1
	this plan is based on big egos......       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3427#msg3427re: one of the problems with the genesis [chuck1]        'never' is a very long time.	1
	i'm sure many/most people in the 1970s and 1980s never thought they would see a day where people would pay well over $30,000 for a toyota or honda.	1
	yet that is commonplace today.	1
	and there is nothing stopping hyundai from creating a separate marque for its high-end cars such as genesis in the future, as did toyota and honda.	1
	funny how discussions of the genesis seem to turn from how the car performs and compares to its competition to how hyundai will never be able to sell luxury cars.	1
	which if you haven't noticed, they are doing right now, in a very tough market for luxury cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3428#msg3428re: one of the problems with the genesis [jeffreid]         also, when you only have to get your car serviced twice a year (per the maintainence log), is a fancy waiting area really that big of a deal?	1
	although not a deal breaker, luxury car buyers have come to expect a degree of 'luxury' in the dealership.	1
	with this being a new model having more complexities than its fellow hyundais, its reliability and therefore the number of trips needed to the service dept.	1
	at this point is unclear.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3429#msg3429re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]        the car buying public perception is that south korea is not a maker of luxury products.	1
	let's not forget how hyundai is coming in to the market.	1
	it's price!	1
	yes, i will say you were right if they can do the same thing that toyota did with the first lexus ls400.	1
	price it cheap to get in to the market and raise the price.	1
	i do not think hyundai will be able to pull it off.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3430#msg3430re: one of the problems with the genesis [chuck1]         price it cheap to get in to the market and raise the price.	1
	hyundai has been successful doing just that with other car models over the past 10 years.	1
	for example, compare the price of a sonata 10 years ago to their price today.	1
	compare the price of a santa fe 8 years ago, when they first debuted, to prices today.	1
	i never thought i'd see a $20,000 elantra, but now we have them.	1
	i think they can do it with the genesis.. it just won't happen overnight, which is what i think some people expect.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3431#msg3431re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]        that's a hard one to figure.	1
	yes, the sonata costs more as far as msrp, but the real world transaction figures are (i am guessing here) approximately $5,000.00 less than sticker.	1
	how much has the price really gone up?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3432#msg3432re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]        of course vehicles are going to be more costly today than they were 8-10 years ago.	1
	cars today have more gadgets than they did 10 years ago.	1
	i have a 2003 hyundai santa fe and it doesn't even have an ipod connection or stability control.	1
	gas, milk, clothes, etc.	1
	are more costly today than they were 10 years ago.	1
	they cost of the materials to make the cars are going up so they price of the car will go up.	1
	that should be expected.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3433#msg3433re: one of the problems with the genesis [chuck1]        a loaded sonata v6 now stickers for over $28,000.	1
	sure, it is possible to get about $5000 off of these prices in the current market, at some of the high-volume dealerships anyway, but you are still looking at lots of sonatas being sold for over $20,000.	1
	that just was not happening 10, or even 5 years ago.	1
	the prices have definitely come up on the sonata, and other hyundais.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3434#msg3434re: one of the problems with the genesis [zone4]        the point is that the price of hyundais has been going up at a faster rate than competitors' prices (e.g.	1
	honda, toyota) over the same time span.	1
	to me that indicates that hyundai does have a good shot at selling the genesis at its current pricing, with some room for growth in the future as more features are added, and as you noted manufacturing costs increase.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3435#msg3435re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]         funny how discussions of the genesis seem to turn from how the car performs and compares to its competition to how hyundai will never be able to sell luxury cars                the original poster said that hyundai would never be considered a luxury brand - not that you wouldn't or couldn't find a hyundai branded product with high price tags.	1
	we have that now.	1
	your example of similarily priced toyotas and hondas is a bad one relative to chuck1's  point simply because toyota and honda are not and will never be luxury brands either.	1
	they have lexus and acura for that, a point you do seem to recognize when you point out hyundai's biggest mistake with the genesis - in that it can never be accepted in those 'luxury' clubs as it is being currently marketed.	1
	it is unfortunate to what is apparently a creditable effort on hyundai's part, that they are ostensibly 'barking up the wrong tree' in those silly 'comparisons' in their ad campaigns etc.	1
	.	1
	and all this has nothing to do with how truly good the car is or isn't.	1
	lexus and acura (and infiniti to a lesser degree) succeeded because 1) the good reputations of their parent cos. 2) the fact that those companies differentiated those new products thru a unique dealership structure and 3) because the cars ended up being solid enough that they justified nos.	1
	1 and no.	1
	2.                                as it is right now hyundai only paid attention to one of those three things - and even that the jury is still out on.	1
	if hyundai wants to be seriously considered as a bmw (or lexus) alternative than it needs to be sold and priced like one - and a little more in the sophistication out of the engineering dept wouldn't hurt either!	1
	don't believe you could find even the most  'glass half full' hyundai executive that could look you straight in the eye and tell you that selling 1000 cars a month or so is satisfactory or even within any of hyundai's most pessimistic expectations regardless of how 'tough' the car market is.	1
	but no matter, they are doing about everything they can to make sure it will fail - which will be a loss for all of us        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3436#msg3436re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        they will succeed.	1
	the only 'problem' is that they will first be seen only as a 'premium' brand before being seen as luxury.	1
	a step that they don't seem to want to, but should and are going to have to take whether they want to or not.	1
	the press will only come to refer to them as a premium brand in the near term, but if they continue to improve their product (and increase prices commensurately), they will be recognized as a legitimate luxury brand in the far term.	1
	however, they mustn't forget kia in the meantime.	1
	i think the borrego just might be a hint at their intentions there.	1
	if hyundai is to be seen as 'true luxury,' then the lesser brands have to be able to stand up as well.	1
	you can't have your lesser division(s) so horrendous that no one would seriously consider your luxury division; see cadillac/gm.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3437#msg3437re: one of the problems with the genesis [tayl0rd]        good points, it's just too bad they weren't able to set up a different branding for the genesis and possibly include the veracruz (which are both quite comparable to the more prestigious nameplates entry vehicles).	1
	if they would have started w/ 3 distinct models and separated from the hyundai name they would have a better foot in the door and would be easier to make the infinity/lexus/acura comparos.	1
	it would also have been easier to provide a more unique  special buying experience (and yes, it does matter in this demographic).	1
	hyundai has pretty much established that it is comparable to the toyotas/hondas/nissans w/ their base vehicles so i think they could have pulled it off (if they had the capital, which is a big factor obviously).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3438#msg3438re: one of the problems with the genesis [tayl0rd]        i would bet you that a marketing study of some sort would put hyundai well above the almost identical kias in terms of perceived quality for those buyers that don't lump both brands together anyway.	1
	but when your at the bottom of the totem pole (kia) it's not hard to be 'better' than  anything!	1
	hyundai is already the 'premium' korean brand if that truly means anything.	1
	didn't say it was fair or even necessarily true - only  a fact of life that hyundai doesn't seem to want to deal with.	1
	it is difficult to sell anything with price as its primary attribute and then turn around and expect the semi-intelligent buyer not to wonder why that something is so cheap in the first place.	1
	its kinda like the problem chrysler currently has - rather suspect that the car buyer believes that chrysler has to warranty their cars forever simply because their cars are of suspect quality not better quality.	1
	and likewise the toyotas and hondas of the world don't because they don't have to....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3439#msg3439re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        first, i did                 not                point out that hyundai's biggest mistake with the genesis is that it can never be accepted in the 'luxury clubs.'	1
	those are your words.	1
	second, has anyone considered that the path honda, lexus, and nissan took is not the                 only                path to success in this market?	1
	i wonder how many pundits doomed lexus, acura, and infiniti to failure after they had been selling cars for only a few months, and in a much more receptive market for low-end luxury cars than we have today?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3440#msg3440re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]        so i suppose that if somebody repeatedly shows you the right way to do something, a way that has been demonstrated to work - the first thing that you would do then is do what has been demonstrated not to work???	1
	sounds kind of risky if not downright foolish to me.	1
	and yep a number of quite knowledgeable auto experts predicted failure for things like the ls400 back in the late 80's.	1
	after all, the whole concept of anybody paying $40 large back then for a toyota product was ridiculous right?	1
	except that being made by toyota was an asset not a liability, it was sold in a place that treated its customers like kings and queens, and lastly, was (and is)  a car that easily justified those big bucks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3441#msg3441re: one of the problems with the genesis [backy]        backy...the luxury debate with the genesis is one that has been ongoing and the captain is truly one against it.	1
	the problem, he says, is that it can't be a luxury sedan simply because it's not made by a luxury brand.	1
	that's his story and he's sticking to it.	1
	funny thing is...all the folks that matter in the auto world media has indeed said the genesis is a luxury offering from hyundai.	1
	the car itself can be successful because it is what it is for the price it's being offered and it's really hard to touch that.	1
	the problem lies in the company itself in not doing enough to stand behind the fact that it's a luxury sedan.	1
	i mean...when folks buy a luxury sedan, they expect luxury service.	1
	hyundai is still stuck in value mode in their way of thinking...they put the cart in front of the horse.	1
	in essence, they don't have to create another name plate in order to be successful in the luxury market, they need to address the dealerships and bring them up to speed and make ownership of the genesis a luxury experience.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3442#msg3442re: one of the problems with the genesis [allmet33]         the captain is truly one against it                not 'against' anything at all,  just trying to inject a bit of realism where hyundai, in this case, apparently can't.	1
	gm knows it can't produce a luxury car called a chevy, they need to call it a cadillac and price it accordingly for it to be accepted and successful as a luxury car.	1
	the same holds true for many many of the other larger manufacturers.	1
	this is nothing against hyundai or even the genesis, which may be the best thing ever put on 4 wheels                , only some comments on why, imo, it must 'fail' if things continue the way they are.       	1

	you may not have used those exact words, but i know if we go back through the postings...we could find those conversations.	1
	i was the one saying that the genesis would be the benz/lexus/bmw for the blue collar worker and you totally shot that down as not being viable at all.	1
	honestly, it isn't about what hyundai can't do...they did it.	1
	it's just a matter of the public accepting that fact.	1
	you can put cat fur on a dog and it'll still be a dog, just like you can put a hyundai badge on a luxury car...it's still a luxury car.	1
	we all know the genesis isn't the best thing put on wheels, but it is the best thing that hyundai has put on wheels.	1
	one point we agree on wholeheartedly...customer service must change in order for the genesis to enjoy the success that's awaiting it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3444#msg3444re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]         so i suppose that if somebody repeatedly shows you the right way to do something, a way that has been demonstrated to work - the first thing that you would do then is do what has been demonstrated not to work???	1
	who before has tried to do what hyundai is doing, that is, offer a car that can compete with luxury cars costing $10-20k more but at a price more like that of a gussied-up mid-sized sedan?	1
	and no, vw is not the right answer.	1
	personally i would not trash hyundai's strategy only because it is different than what some other companies have done before.	1
	if you have studied or experienced anything about competitive marketing strategy, you know that it is generally not a good idea to follow exactly the same strategy and positioning as others who are already entrenched in the marketplace.	1
	also, as far as the toyota example... i would have had to predict failure for lexus too, since toyota's customer service was quite poor (based on my experience) back in the late '80s.	1
	somehow they got past that problem, though.	1
	and i don't see any problem justifying the price of a genesis based on what you get.	1
	i think it's a relative bargain, backed by a company that has proven it can build high-quality, reliable cars--not just low-priced cars.	1
	in other words, about where toyota was in the late '80s, but the genesis' price is far below that of the ls400 from that time, even though it's 20 years later.       	1

	by george, i think you got it!	1
	whether or not they actually did it                 is                a matter of the public accepting that 'fact'.	1
	what is a 'fact' to perhaps you and backy is obviously escaping more 'average' folks i guess, you know those 'average' folks that spend a lot of money to get on a 6 month waiting list that tmk doesn't exist at any hyundai dealer i know of.	1
	or that they find that the average genesis buyer used to own bmws or mbs, and simply think it's a better car than what they had, because in all likely hood the price difference is not what makes the decision for buyers like this.	1
	they want the best, they are willing to pay for it, and lastly, of course, want the rest of the world to understand that.       	1

	whether or not it could be a 'luxury' car or not, sure i have my doubts - becuase it still isn't!	1
	in fact, as i have related before, i have spent quite a bit of time working in that country and have a great deal of respect for the korean people and their abilities and commitments to do whatever they choose.	1

	because they                 are                ... the tens of thousands of buyers of veracruzes and genesis sedans at over $30k.	1
	hyundai's challenge in this tough economy for auto sales is to get more people to buy those $30k+ vehicles.	1
	difficult?	1
	of course.	1
	i just don't think it's as impossible as some others think it is.	1
	as for the 'blue collar' bmw... it exists.	1
	it's called the honda accord.	1
	but the genesis is not a 'blue collar bmw'.	1
	it's more a 'blue collar' lexus or mercedes, or an alternative to domestic competition like cadillac.	1
	or maybe more like a 'business casual' lexus or mercedes.	1
	anyway, you may as well keep generalities like 'you hyundai guys' to yourself, since they are totally inaccurate.	1
	unless you mean anyone who has ever owned a hyundai and has a positive opinion of them is a 'hyundai guy.'	1

	- azeras have been discounted heavily since day one and the genesis - a car that if we are to accept how 'revolutionary' the thing is  not selling at the                 premium                that it should be.	1
	both are not selling in any truly competitive quantities.	1
	hyundai is not a 'small potatoes' manufacturer, and i find it hard to believe that anybody back in ulsan can be happy with the actual number of buyers they are finding for the vehicles you mention especially given the absurdly low prices they are finding it necessary to sell them for.	1
	even in a better car market, hyundais have been 'screaming deals' for quite some time now, and i will also admit that they are slowly shedding that cheap korean car with no resale value image, but also that this is primarily happening on the elantras, sonatas etc.	1
	not the high ticket entries.	1
	try it - pull up a brand spanking new v8 genesis in your driveway and then tell your neighbor that you spent $40 something grand+  for the thing and see if you don't get the most incredulous 'are you crazy' look you've ever seen.	1
	and it has nothing to do with the car being 'worth' it at all - it's all perception - hyundais are not                 allowed                to cost that kinda money regardless of how good they might be.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3456#msg3456re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        i thought you were talking about luxury cars?	1
	the azera is at best a near-luxury car, and barely scrapes over the $30k msrp bar when fully loaded.	1
	similar to the accord v6 in pricing--do you think the accord is a luxury car too?	1
	so the azera is not a relevant example.	1
	the veracruz and genesis routinely sell for well over $30k.	1
	i really don't care diddly squat what my neighbors think of what i drive.	1
	it's my money, and my car.	1
	if i cared about that, maybe i wouldn't have bought my first hyundai 8 years ago and i wouldn't own one now.	1
	although i have never had a single negative comment from any neighbor or friend or co-worker about the hyundais i've owned.	1
	and over the years i've seen more and more of them buy hyundais for themselves.	1
	hyundai is not a 'small potatoes' manufacturer, and i find it hard to believe that anybody back in ulsan can be happy with the actual number of buyers they are finding for the vehicles you mention especially given the absurdly low prices they are finding it necessary to sell them for.	1
	i would say that no one in ulsan or detroit or tokyo or several other places is happy with the actual number of buyers they are finding for their vehicles right now, especially luxury sedans.	1
	and last time i noticed, there are humongous deals available now on luxury cars from                 every                manufacturer.       	1

	the azera is at best a near-luxury car, and barely scrapes over the $30k msrp bar when fully loaded                actually what i think i said was                 any                korean car with that $30k+ pricetag is a difficult sell.	1
	i'll also contend also that neither the azera or the genesis are 'luxury' cars - they can't be - and not because they don't have enough 'bling' to qualify - they can't be a 'luxury' car in the same way that chevy and ford (and others) can't make one either - it's a perception.	1
	toyota can produce a $40k avalon loaded to the gills with about every 'convenience' known to mankind - but it still is not a 'luxury ' car.	1
	neither is the azera - or the genesis.	1
	the fact that you don't care 'what your neighbor thinks' is admirable, somewhat unusual, and also puts you  squarely in the heart of hyundai's buying demographic.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3459#msg3459re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        captain, captain....captain, all those conversations we had...debates rather and now you don't want to own up to what you said?	1
	you mean to tell me you don't remember one time where you didn't think that hyundai would actually be able to bring a luxury car to market?	1
	you don't recall ever saying that it couldn't be a luxury car simply because hyundai isn't a luxury label?	1
	wow!!!	1
	now...whether the public, or yourself for that matter, chooses to accept it or not...it is reality.	1
	the genesis has been rolled out and it is indeed a luxury car.	1
	the only real issues the genesis suffers from is the ride quality, some missing amenities and a few rumblings about an unfinished trunk with not having a covering on the underside of the rear deck.	1
	why, praytell is blue collar bmw/benz oxymoronic?	1
	what i mean by that is the average blue collar worker isn't going to afford an s-class, ls or 7 series.	1
	however,  they can afford a genesis because it costs thousands less than any of the aforementioned offerings in the lowest trim level.	1
	what i gripe about with the ads is the fact that the azera didn't get put out in advertising except for a brief run of a couple of months and that was it.	1
	i'm talking a year after the car was introduced.	1
	the genesis, however...has enjoyed recognition and hype since the superbowl and ever since then.	1
	how can you say the effect is negligible?	1
	initial genesis sales are better than initial azera sales were, i think that shows significant proof that advertising is needed.	1
	also, if the car buying public isn't ready for a $30k+ hyundai, then why would initial genesis sales be better than initial azera sales???	1
	you never did like the ads hyundai has put out, but....there's not a single aspect you can say isn't true.	1
	i think it just gets your goat that hyundai can actually make those claims.	1

	it has every conceivable luxury i can think of (and some i wouldn't have thought of) and matches competition from luxury marques like lexus in almost every feature.	1

	the difference between what hyundai has accomplished and what volkswagen attempted to pull of with the phaeton is the fact the genesis is priced in such a manner to make it plausible for the company itself.	1
	unlike volkswagen that went from the passat at $35k all the way up to the phaeton that they wanted $70k (v-8) and $90k for the v-12 (or was it w-12).	1
	anyway...if they had priced the car around $50k...they could've pulled it off.	1
	the fact that it was a hand built car didn't even make it worth the money they were asking.	1
	now...if hyundai jumped out there and priced the genesis up there with the likes of the ls, 7 series and s-classes, then yes...it would have been a hilariously sad misstep on their part.	1
	i will say this, when you simply talk about a hyundai costing $40k, it may seem unfathomable, but when one actually goes and sits in the car, takes it for a spin and then compares it to the cars that cost upwards of $10k more...it really is quite justifiable and easy to see.	1
	sorry captain, that's the reality of it that you just don't care or wish to accept.	1
	honestly, the folks that have the most problem with it are the ones that feel they do need to answer to their neighbors, family and friends for the choice they made in purchasing the likes of a genesis.	1
	my question is...removing that part of the equation, how many folks do you think would actually by a hyundai if they weren't worried about what their peers would think?	1
	please, don't try and answer the question because you really can't (heck...i can't)...it is simply being asked because, well...it really makes me wonder!       	1

	it's just funny how everyone that has reviewed the car has said it is indeed a luxury car.	1
	so if the folks that matter, or at least the ones that folks seem to pay attention to, are saying it is...how can someone that isn't an auto industry authority claim it not to be simply because of the brand name attached to it?        	1

	no fold-down seat is a major design flaw that the genesis shares with many--but not all--upscale car models.	1
	the car is a suzuki verona and has been highly reliable.	1

	i mean...there are a lot of luxury sedans that don't have that feature.	1
	granted, there are some that offer it as an option, and maybe that's something hyundai should consider.	1

	etc.	1
	make a 'luxury' car' either.	1

	and neither is the current more performance oriented and more capable g8 either (the 300c, and the next gen impala perhaps all in this group) - although the bling levels are not there.	1
	all this only because all of these cars do not wear the proper set of clothes.	1
	now if the genesis was simply a car  sold exclusively thru genesis dealers, had those trained and competent sales people ready to buss your right cheek at any given opportunity, and wasn't fighting the quite mundane and somewhat questionable reputation that hyundai does have - then, just maybe, you would have a 'luxury' car.	1

	[allmet33]        as i'm sure you are aware, the real reason why you don't find those treasured fold downs in many true luxury sedans is because those rear seats will also recline and lastly because the last thing the buyer of such a vehicle would do is use it as a station wagon.	1
	better to impress your business buddies with a comfortable ride in your back seat, which, in some cars is every bit as pleasant as the fronts.	1
	avalons and maximas can have this feature and although both are very fine automobiles neither is your mysterious 'luxury' car.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3471#msg3471re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]         the a8 competes and is accepted just fine into the ranks of the performance luxury cars, except for some aluminum used in the audi - the phaeton was (is?)	1
	an identical car except for that one very important thing , that label!.the phaeton, btw , as good as it was, was doomed for failure at $50k or $70k, a car that expensive doesn't wear vw's set of clothes, and nor is it sold at the same place as a $25k diesel rabbit.	1
	$70 grand for a vw - yeah right!, $40 grand for a hyundai - (fill in your own blanks).	1
	the a8 wasn't in question, the phaeton was and my point was...had they priced it more accordingly, it would have sold.	1
	heck, vw was selling a $50k+ suv with no problem, but a $70k+ sedan...yeah right.	1
	when it's all said and done, the genesis will enjoy much more success than the phaeton did simply because it's actually comparable to other sedans in it's class in terms of offerings, but at a huge discount compared to the premium brands.	1
	the phaeton was the reverse of that and its demise was imminent.	1
	$40k is merely a price set by hyundai, do they believe that the public will pay that for it...i don't think so.	1
	i do believe they set that price with their target being the high $30k's which is exactly what they are getting for them.       	1

	have you seen a maybach?	1
	you're certainly not buying an exclusive look because it still looks like a benz.	1
	the exclusivity would come by owning the top tier flag-ship of that automaker...i mean, luxury is luxury, right?	1
	now wait a minute...first you say that in order for a luxury sedan to be successful, it must be made by a luxury name plate.	1
	a maybach is a luxury sedan, is it not?	1
	mercedes benz is a luxury name plate, is it not?	1
	mb is also known to sell cars that cost six figures already, so why in the world would a 'super' s-class not work for benz???	1
	oh, that's right...that's what you've learned to believe by watching the likes of toyota/lexus, nissan/infiniti and the likes.	1
	wow...so even a luxury name plate has to create an ultra-luxury name plate to sell and utra luxury sedan.	1
	so because that's what toyota, nissan  honda have done, hyundai must follow behind them and do the same in order to be successful, right?	1
	hyundai is blazing a new path and that is what has the other automakers concerned.	1
	they're not dumping money into creating a luxury name plate that'll take a least a decade to recoupe, they're doing it under one single name.	1
	the only thing you can do is continue to be in denial.       	1

	and this is the rub, if the genesis was truly a 'luxury' car with those kind of attributes both real and perceived, then hyundai wouldn't be worried about about how much they are going to                 have                to discount it, the customers would be flocking onto the dealer lots, begging off their late model bmws, and begging that non-existent knowledgeable hyundai sales guy to please please take my money - not caring what it costs.	1

	not exaclty true because their demographic isn't the ones that already own bmw's, mb's and the sort.	1
	now if they happen to get some, that's a plus on their part.	1
	they are working within their value niche by bringing a luxury vehicle to those that can't afford to get the same thing because of pricing that mb, bmw and the like offer.	1
	the genesis gives them that at a price they can afford.	1
	that being said, their target are those that own near luxury sedans like the avalon, azera, 300 and want a bit more without having to spend $45k+ to get it.       	1

	they're not dumping money into creating a luxury name plate that'll take a least a decade to recoupe                another history lesson for those of you that choose to ignore it - toyota back in the middle late 80s was not nearly in the same financial shape they are in today.	1
	it's not like they were hurting, but definitely not able to launch completely new brands without some help.	1
	so where do you suppose that help came from?	1
	how about from existing toyota dealers (as well as other brands).	1
	it came in the form of franchise fees, and there was a line around the block of dealers that couldn't wait to help toyota pull off what they were about to pull off.	1
	that's history, which i understand means nothing to you but do you think that maybe, just maybe the reason why hyundai didn't create a 'genesis' brand is because there is nowhere near that kind of demand for its products?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3476#msg3476re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        ahhhhhhhh...no you make a valid point and i agree with you.	1
	the demand isn't quite there yet, but...if they tweak the genesis the way it needs to be, make sure the azera and sonata can be durable solid offerings along with the santa fe and veracruz and establish a respectable reputation...that'll change.	1
	is it to say that they won't eventually branch off and create a luxury name plate, no, but right now it's not feasible for them and therefore...they are boldly going where no automaker has gone before.	1
	i know this part is a bit off topic, but you do know the sonata is 20 years old this year, right?	1
	go back and see if you can remember the sonata's start and where it is now...night and day, wouldn't you say?	1
	trust me, i know history more so than some of the folks that frequent this forum.	1
	i knew that toyota and honda didn't enjoy immediate success when they landed in the u.s.  they actually went through the very same growing pains hyundai went through, however then...they didn't have other automakers to be compared to.	1
	hyundai has paid attention to their blueprint and that's whey they've been able to turn things around as drastically as they have compared to their start.	1
	i think we can all agree that the vehicles they produce today are far much better than the excel they started with.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3477#msg3477re: one of the problems with the genesis [allmet33]        the problem with genesis is in the name hyundai..                                do you remember mazda millenia?	1
	the mazda millenia was originally planned as the second of three luxury cars for mazda's luxury brand, amati.	1
	mazda's dwindling finances could not support amati brand, the millenia was launched 1995 and it replaced the 929.                                it was developed for a separate audience from typical mazda customers, the millenia boasted a myriad of finer details for its time.	1
	it was engineered to far greater levels of perceived quality than existing mazda cars, such as interior plastic, panel gap and thicker paint coating.	1
	the millenia was assembled in a new production line presumably set up for amati cars.	1
	it was the only production car in the world to employ a miller cycle engine.	1
	yaw-sensitive 4-wheel steering was available as an option in japan; mazda claimed that with this feature, the millenia was capable of passing the elk test at speeds comparable to the bmw 850i, surpassing the z32 nissan 300zx.	1
	in the usa, the millenia was available with or without the miller cycle engine (the 'millenia s' spec).	1
	link title                                it was sold along with mazda 323, 626, b series pickup etc                                 so what happened to millenia?	1
	it was face lifted in 1997 which include numerous cost saving measure like changing/downgrading hood from aluminium to steel etc... and was finally killed.	1
	in my opinion the brand perception is significant in luxury segment.	1
	lexus/acura/infiniti have survived because they are 'different' brand.	1
	acura stumbled initially because they 'named' the luxury car legend/integra/vigor... legend became a luxury name plate... integra  vigor were just another cars...it took them a while to go to alphanumeric nomenclature...                                now you drive an acura first then tsx/tl/mdx etc...                you lexus first then es/gs/ls                you dribe bmw first then 1 series/5 series/7series                                in case of hyundai..you drive hyundai first then genesis                                same reason 'mayback' was created because merc was not exclusive enough...a 200k mb s65 still a mass luxury merc                                you see the picture?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3478#msg3478re: one of the problems with the genesis [sanjaysdca]        sorry...mazda never produced anything luxury.	1
	at best...near luxury like the azera  avalon.	1
	i've been in the 929, i've been in the milennia and i've been in the diamante...none offered anything above what the avalon or azera gives you now.	1
	sorry, that's the truth.	1
	the genesis on the other hand, it offers...pound for pound...pretty much what a lexus gs offers and quite a bit of what an ls offers.	1
	what mazda can ever tout that claim?	1
	amati???	1
	never made it off the ground because mazda had problems producing solid problem free cars.	1
	the 929 was the best one, because after that the milennia and the diamante suffered from a lot of electrical and transmission problems.	1
	sorry...mazda just didn't know what they were doing.	1
	their niche is sport-minded vehicles which they've been quite successful with.	1
	that new 6 is sweet...zoom-zoom!!!!	1
	by the way...it's maybach.	1

	they should be able to do things in half the time that it took the japanese.	1
	they not only have the blueprint in front of them logistically, but also real live 4 wheeled examples of what to do it with.	1
	imo, for what it's not worth                , would have hyundai establishing true reliability reputations for all their products (not just showing some improvement - as they are now), developing cars and an entire car line similar (at least in spirit) to the genesis/veracruz, and then watch what happens when they try to actually sell it - as, of course, something other than a hyundai.	1
	imagine the reverberations that would be felt all the way back to the east coast of rok, a car where sticker price means something - ahh, the novelty and profitabilty of it all                and btw if you think the old excels they sold in this country were bad, you would be happy to know that it was better than what the koreans were driving around in(called ponys over there) .	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3484#msg3484re: one of the problems with the genesis [sanjaysdca]        finally a bit of sanity in this bantering that i always seem to get into with the 'h' guys - .appreciate the logic of the questions and further agree with your particular answers.	1
	only one comment - hyundai has unfortunately gotten itself into a position (as buick has, for example) of offering its products primarily on the basis of price or discount amounts.	1
	in this regard the genesis is certainly no exception - it is certainly a car the ought to cost more (even at sticker) that perhaps can't simply because of who sells it and more importantly what the customer thinks ought to happen when that company's products are bought.	1
	this also needs to change if hyundai is going to improve its 'standing' amongst the hierarchy of auto mfgrs.	1
	nobody goes into a lexus, toyota, honda, acura, mb or bmw dealer etc.	1
	etc.	1
	and expects anywhere near the 'discount that he/she might expect buying that korean car.	1
	not that many years ago, when shopping full size sedans spent a lot of time looking over the infiniti g, and m35s.	1
	this was in april 05 and the m was brand new.	1
	the g was a blast, about the money i wanted to spend, but simply too small and perhaps a bit too 'sporting' for my tastes.	1
	the m35 was perfect - with what i think was called a 'journey' package, it stickered at something over $41k, but was drive out priced at $45k (plus ttl) - why?	1
	-  because of demand and because the car in effect was underpriced for what it was (and still is) .	1
	some of these things we can say about the genesis, others we can't.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3485#msg3485re: one of the problems with the genesis [allmet33]         if you say so, benz was doing just fine along with bentley and rolls before they decided to create maybach.	1

	i will give you that.	1

	what is a 'blue collar luxury'.. its a oxymoron                                i don't have to call it luxury, everyone else in the automotive world is, you just can't accept it because it was made by hyundai.	1
	blue collar luxury = luxury that's attainable by joe six-pack                                 for 40k you can get fully loaded maxima, avalon, non exclusive and provide good 'blue collar luxury                                hmmmmmm...sorry, wrong answer.	1
	the avalon  maxima are near luxury (as already stated) and if that were the case, then why aren't they compared to the likes of lexus or infiniti cars like the genesis is?	1
	you are correct its not rocket science... class is a merc (marque), 1 and 3 series are bmw (marque) first                                at least you know what a marquee is, however...while mb and bmw are marquee nameplates, the genesis is a marquee car made by an everyday nameplate.	1
	i know you can't stand that fact, but...it is reality...just accept it.	1
	this is what i read somewhere:                  real luxury buyers and 'other car' buyers they both open their check book while they buy cars.	1
	the difference is real luxury buyers open it without knowing/caring for amount they have to write...more often its someone else writing it for them.	1
	to a degree you're right, however...i know plenty of folks that drive e  s-classes, 5  7-series that went in looking for the best possible deal they could find.	1

	in the end here is the acid test.	1
	you drive up to a parking attendent in a genesis and an s class..who do you think will get more attention?	1
	dunno, to be honest...probably the genesis because s-class sedans are so common they're nothing special.	1
	c  e-classes are even more abundant, at least in my area so that would be even worse.	1
	the genesis would get more attention hands down because it's not a car seen frequently.	1
	i know that based of the response received when i drove my azera around when i first got it.	1
	so actually...your case isn't rested because your point hasn't been proven in any light.	1
	you don't have to refrain from any more discussion because this has really been a good debate, but it's your call.	1
	indeed, the genesis is a great car (considering who it's made by) for what it offers and the price point that it's offered at.	1
	i'm sorry to hear you had a negative experience with a salesman.	1
	ultimately...that could be the one thing that truly hurts the genesis, but hardly the car itself.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3492#msg3492re: one of the problems with the genesis [sanjaysdca]         need to define what luxury is?	1
	if its having all the amenities and doodads then any loaded car is a luxury (09 maxima, genesis, azera, g8, etc)                                    if luxury is 'image'.. which it is in image conscious usa then hyundai is not luxury...                  read any newspaper article.	1
	car magazine they talk about luxury nameplate like merc/bmw/etc.... they dont talk about luxury car(s)                                a loaded car does not a luxury car make, in terms of the max, avalon  g8...there's no ambiance of luxury when sitting in the cars.	1
	the genesis however, has qualities inside that are on the level of what lexus would put out (which has been documented).	1
	also, you're right...mb and bmw are talked about as luxury nameplates because everything they produce is in the luxury category.	1
	hyundai won't be mentioned as a luxury nameplate because they don't produce luxury exclusive vehicles, however....the genesis is luxury vehicle produced by everyday hyundai, so the car itself gets talked about in terms of luxury.	1
	it's really not that hard.	1
	totally agree here                                okay...you totally agree to point #6, which stated that the genesis is a smooth riding, quiet, well powered luxury sedan.	1
	so...here you admit the genesis is a luxury sedan, but everywhere else you denounce it's luxury status.	1
	thats exactly what it is...a bargain                                ahhhhhhhhh...okay, so what makes it a bargain?	1
	is it the fact that you can get the size of an s-class, the amenities of an e-class for the price of a c-class?	1
	in short, you can get the luxury found in most mid-level luxury offerings by the premium brands for the price their entry level luxury cars fetch.	1

	are you starting to understand?	1
	i have never said that the genesis would compete directly with the premium brands and pull sales from them...hardly.	1
	the fact is...the car can be compared (in many ways) to cars costing $10k and more.	1
	to someone that's used to what they get from an mb, bmw or what have you, they could care less about what the genesis is all about, but take someone that can't get into a mid or upper level premium sedan and they'll think the world of a genesis.	1
	i've never owned a premium vehicle in my life, i've got friends that have and currently own them and even they raise their eyebrows when it comes to the genesis.	1
	they say my car is nice, not great, just nice and to be honest...that's a compliment coming from them considering what they are used to.	1
	does the genesis make any of them want to give up what they have, i doubt it, but it's the first car made by an everyday automaker that actually catches the eye of some of them, that's more than the avalon, maxima, 300 or azera does.	1
	also, the other thing that i do agree with is the customer service relating to the genesis will certainly cause problems.	1
	how do you offer everyday service to a luxury car owner?	1
	it won't fly and will certainly tarnish the luxury image the genesis is supposed to have.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3497#msg3497re: one of the problems with the genesis [sanjaysdca]        hey sanjaysdca....i really don't think that hyundai is trying to create a luxury division to go after the market occupied by mb, bmw, infiniti and such.	1
	if hyundai sticks to their guns, then their goal is to bring luxury to the masses in a way that the others can't do.	1
	they saw what was capable of happening with the azera and they took that and turned it up a few notches when they created the genesis.	1
	if it's looked at from that perspective, there's a very good chance that the genesis can be successful.	1
	however, the one reason it will be held down is the customer service related to it.	1
	i completely agree with you and whoever states that.	1
	if hyundai were to branch out and create a luxury division, then the knock against them would be that they are trying it.	1
	i mean, there will always be detractors that will find fault in every move they make.	1
	if they had jumped out there and created a luxury brand, then everyone would be saying how stupid they were and how much money they're gonna lose and that nobody would take them seriously because ultimately...hyundai stands behind it.	1
	it's almost a no-win situation for hyundai when it comes to those that aren't exactly fans of hyundai to begin with.	1
	so...instead of dumping millions of dollars creating that luxury division now, roll out a luxury car under their already pretty successful label, tweak it and evolve it to what it really should be and as it was said before, allow the reliability and durability records to grow for their line-up so they can be taken more seriously before venturing off down the luxury division path.	1
	personally...i think what they can do is create the luxury division and use the azera as the entry level sedan, the genesis sedan would be the flagship and you would also have the genesis coupe and maybe the veracruz to start out with 4 vehicles and grow from there.	1
	just my opinion though.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3498#msg34981st gen genesis vs 1st gen ls400         reviewers found the ls 400 superior in comfort, engine performance, ergonomics, ride quality, styling, and overall value,[36] while critics faulted styling and the softer, more isolated ride (depending on suspension setup).	1
	[37] the largely positive reaction (with similar results in other reviews) stunned the automotive industry, as a relative newcomer had beaten long-established brands at their own game.	1
	wow...if that don't like exactly what the genesis is going through!!!	1
	the only difference is...the ls400 was rolled out as the inaugural sedan for a luxury brand and the genesis is being rolled out as the flagship luxuy sedan for an everyday brand.	1

	genesis as a car has all the right elements to be a highly successful.	1

	hyundai should have, as you suggested, floated a new brand with a clones azera, cloned veracruz, and genesis as a flagship..                                or they may decide to slowly shift accent/elantra to kia and hyundai might become a premium brand... that is a long shot because of previous baggage       	1

	no - probably dumb on their part even in the hypothetical.	1
	this type of thing is exactly what any manufacturer would want to if it wants yto change its image and further be recognized as something it is plainly not.	1
	also, dumb on their part: telling a prospective customer that their car is too good for him -  this from one of the brands that spends more time dealing with the lower extremes of the car market than perhaps anybody else.	1
	in any case, as a few of us will tell you - 'luxury' cars come from 'luxury' brands and conversely there can never be a 'luxury' car sold by a 'non luxury' manufacturer regardless of how 'luxurious' that car may or may not be.	1
	which is why the genesis isn't what you think it is....                yep, hyundai could have learned something just by reading this little wiki blurb - but maybe you are right -  they want to make history, not learn from it??	1

	i mean...think about it...even though they are commuter cars, imagine owners of such benefitting from luxury-like treatment when they bring their cars in.	1
	if the cars are truly more dependable and require less trips to the shop, then it can't be that difficult to 'pad' customer service.	1

	from my understanding, kia is actually going it's own path in terms of vehicles...trying to separate from hyundai in some fashion.	1

	the car itself is a luxury car.	1
	if it were sat on a platform with no badging or any way to tell who made it, folks would indeed think it's a luxury sedan.	1
	if they were asked to guess how much it would be priced, i'm sure they would put well above $40k, probably in the $50k range, but...because there's that italicized 'h' on the trunk lid...you're telling me that car can't be a luxury car?	1
	it is what it is and there's nothing you can do to change it.	1
	at any rate, toyota created history with lexus and the ls400.	1
	as you stated, they weren't as financially able as they are now, they took that chance and it paid off.	1
	at some point, hyundai has to take a gamble.	1

	expensive yes.. worth my time yes now...                                back when i was in grad school.. in i had a mazda 323..i use to use coupons for oil change $9.99 and two to three hours at the shop.. worth it in terms of time  money...yes then...                at that timei would have laughed at someone trying to rip me off with a $50.00 oil change.	1
	its easier to charge $50.00 for oil change from a person who buys 40k car then from a person who buys 10k car.	1
	and the service managers/sales person are also tuned/wired differently.	1
	it might sound superficial...but thats how the society is.	1
	try going to a open house in a accent/echo/sentra and wearing shorts, flip flops,  tank top... and you probably will be ignored by the agent (even in todays market) do so in an lexus es, business casual, possibly with the family... and it will be a whole lot difference...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3504#msg3504re: 1st gen genesis vs 1st gen ls400 [sanjaysdca]         i applaud your utopian outlook...i really do.	1
	utopian???	1
	however how do hyundai pays for better customer service?	1
	what are you talking about...providing better service isn't something that has to be charged for.	1
	if anything it starts with change, as in changing the attitudes of the service managers  techs.	1
	they need to realize they have jobs because of the folks that purchase cars, we shouldn't be a burden as we did not force them to take the job they have.	1
	heck, i believe that in any line of work.	1
	i hate going to mcdonalds and after they place your order in the bag and roll the top down, they get an attitude when you ask for some packs of ketchup or sauce and they blow their breath like you just messed up their whole day.	1
	all they had to do was ask, 'do you need anything else to comlete your order?'	1
	again, if you are in a certain line of work, provide the best customer service you can as you're the one that applied for that job.	1
	currently i have an infiniti...i take it to the dealer for oil change.	1
	i drop my car off at 7:00 am.	1
	they give me a loaner.	1
	i pick my car up at 6:00pm.	1
	i pay $50.00 for the service.	1
	expensive yes.. worth my time yes now...                                first of all...that $50 is going towards synthetic oil and an oem filter.	1
	the loaner isn't costing them a thing as the car will be sold as a demo.	1
	so...hyundai could do the same thing, however their oil change would only cost about $40 and they could still provide the same service you receive with infiniti.	1
	also, you have think about something...your mazda 323 was using about 4 qts.	1
	of conventional oil at less then $1/qt.	1
	the filter may have been $4...so that's about right.	1
	based on the price of synthetic oil now...$50 is a bargain depending on how many quarts your car takes.	1
	so...what i'm saying is...an oil change for the accents  elantras wouldn't cost $50 because they wouldn't be using the same type or amount of product.	1
	personally, they may initally ignore me based on what i pulled up in, but the man i am will quickly overcome that.	1
	you see...i don't worry what one thinks based on what i pull up in, it's a matter of the impression i leave after dealing with someone.	1
	personally, i like having folks think less of me because of what i drive, then i have the opportunity to blow them away when they get to know me.	1
	in other words, i don't allow my car to define who i am as a man.       	1

	you pay (housing cost) for fresh air you breathe by living in good part of town.	1
	getting good service comes at a cost.	1
	you have to hire/train right person and try to keep them.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3506#msg3506re: 1st gen genesis vs 1st gen ls400 [sanjaysdca]        actually...to a degree you are right.	1
	however, treating customers like they are valuable should be business 101 on any level.	1
	if you want to get your customers to spend more money or accept paying higher fees, then provide better service.	1
	maybe out in cali you have to pay more for a house to get better air to breathe, but here on the east coast...we don't deal with smog.	1
	what i'm saying is...the service managers can provide better service by changing their attitude.	1
	again, they are the ones that applied for those jobs, so obviously they wanted to work there...so act like it.	1
	on the flip side, good customer service can be rewarded with bonuses and awards.	1
	don't play with me, i worked in retail and customer service for years and i always made sure i provided the best possible experience for any customer no matter what i was doing, regardless of my pay level.	1
	at some point...take pride in yourself...it does have a way of paying off in the long run.	1
	heck in retail, i had a customer base that would only buy from me even though there were other qualified sales reps, but because of the experience i provided...they would wait for me to be in to buy and they spread the word...so guess who got more bonuses and awards even though our base pay was still the same?	1
	riiiiiiiiiiiight!	1
	you're right, it is hard to find folks with good work ethics because we live in a very lazy time.	1
	folks are always lookin for shortcuts and easy ways out and they still want a pat on the back or something extra in their pocket.	1
	i guess i'm just too old school in my way of thinking when it comes to customer service.	1
	maybe i'm wrong for holding others to my expectations of what i would provide if i were in their shoes.	1
	bottom line is...a simple chane in attitude can make a world of difference and costs nothing at all.	1
	if anything, they would reap the rewards of it while the customers enjoyed the change.	1
	trust me...i know i'm right on this.       	1

	it's sure as heck not setting the world on fire sales-wise, and while it definitely is a car with the 'right stuff' from a spec sheet perspective, it has not been 'raved' about' (unless you read thru rose colored glasses).	1
	furthermore it is a completely new car with no established track record reliability wise - good or bad.	1
	well reviewed and generally well received for sure but you guys talk about it like it's the second coming                i could sit you down inside any  number of 'flagship' cars from toyota, honda, nissan, chevy,ford etc etc.	1
	and get you thinking you are in a 'luxury' car - by your definition - when in fact you're sitting in something less than that.	1
	as sanjay so correctly stated, being a 'luxury' car has little to do with the car itself.	1
	a good example of this is the current crop of lincolns being sold out there - nothing more than rebadged fords with lots and lots of worthless 'bling' at a stiff price premium, but still having that 'luxury car ' image (to most folks) , when the fact is that ford has cheapened the whole line to some point beyond recognition.	1
	the genesis is a luxury car wanabe (just like that phaeton (or millenia) were) and will continue to be as long as it is labelled and sold as it is and also regardless of how much lincoln-like bling they put on it , the lincolns are simply luxury car atrocities!       	1

	no other hyundai product shares that distinction.	1
	the azera came in with no fanfare at all.	1

	you may not want to accept it, but it's the truth.	1
	at best, the flagship sedans by toyota, honda  nissan are near luxury as already stated many times.	1
	as far as luxury not having anything to do with the car itself is a bunch of b.s.	1

	car dealers do exactly and generally only what they need to do to keep customers happy and also to get high grades for customer service back at corporate headquarters - because it all ties back into what a dealer is able to get to sell (his allotments) and , in some cases, the amounts of profits (holdback percentages).	1
	didn't you ever wonder why your salesman was so interested in you filling out a favorable survey/comment card?	1
	it's simple, there is a bounty on the silly things.	1
	'low end' dealers will have much lower expectations put on them that the true 'luxury' dealer would - think hyundai/toyota vs. lexus/infiniti.	1
	as you and i both seem to understand the day that the genesis becomes a 'luxury' car will definitely be tied to the day that the hyundai dealer becomes like a lexus dealer (and he is generally regarded as such)  - and not be related at all to the 'power ejection seat'  fru-fru that has nothing to do with 'luxury' at all.	1
	that day is still a long way off imo.	1
	you can't change an unfortunate image that took hyundai, in this case, more than 20 years to cultivate, with one better car in one year.	1
	the parallels to the ls400 are similar as far as the sheetmetal goes- but they ignore two of the most important differences - toyota did not have 20 years (or 10 or 15) of a bad reputation to live down, and nor was the car a 'toyota' in the first place, it was a 'lexus'.       	1

	you may be right - and it is certainly not a good time to be selling big sedans with 300 hp+ engines.	1
	the timing stinks.	1
	but, i'll contend that hyundai must find some way to differentiate the genesis from the rest of its product line.	1

	...                                all of that is well and good, but don't slam the car because of it.	1
	that'd be like someone saying a child is deficient in some way or another just because his daycare center has a couple of jacklegs that work there.	1
	hmm...  maybe the genesis should be a latchkey kid!	1
	they could setup a little block house at a corner of the lot that deals exclusively w/ the genesis (coupe and sedan.)	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3529#msg3529re: 1st gen genesis vs 1st gen ls400 [captain2]         if your hyundai dealer is out there providing loaners to everybody that comes in there for an oil change - count yourself lucky.	1
	that kind of stuff just doesn't happen often with the 'common' non-lux brands.	1
	no...that isn't happening, but they do have loaners for those that bring their cars in for service and they need to keep the car for more than a day.	1
	oil changes...i think they have a thing where they guarantee it done in 30 mins or it's free.	1
	so a loaner for just getting an oil change isn't even needed.	1
	however, they have started washing your car for you no matter what you bring it in for.       	1

	don't believe you'll find any of sanjay's or my posts 'slamming' the genesis, quite to the contrary both of us have said exactly the opposite.	1
	there are few that will debate the fact that it is a helluva car.        	1

	infact its good to see the car invoking so many emotions                                will i buy it... probably not                not because of what it is... but because of what it pretends (in my mind) to be                                lets move on....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3533#msg3533genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury        i've following this forum since june just before the hyundai genesis was hitting the dealers.	1
	what peaked my interest was a write-up i saw somewhere that introduced a car that had luxury features found for $15-20,000 more on luxury brands such as lexus, bmw, mercedes, etc.	1
	i make it a point to follow this car since i saw this as an opportunity to buy up without breaking the bank.	1
	since 1987 i have owned honda accords and always bought top of the line.	1
	my 2004 car cost me $25,100.	1
	frankly i would never seriously consider a car for over $40,000 never mind one that is over $50,000.	1
	to me i would rather put the money elsewhere than make a statement to my neighbor or co-worker on what kind of car i own.	1
	but after 20 years of the same car, even though i do love driving accords, i'm ready for a change.	1
	i fully expect to pay more for a car that i will like but how much more is the question.	1
	so why the genesis.	1
	well for one it's a sharp looking car and i like the way it rides.	1
	it's larger than a honda, fantastic sound system and other luxury features that i would never see with my beloved honda.	1
	i haven't bought one yet but plan to sometime next year when prices become more competitive.	1
	i bet i'll be able to get a v6 tech for $36,000 or less by late spring next year.	1
	that's affordable to me.	1
	this whole debate on whether or not the genesis is a luxury car and whether or not hyundai is worthy of having a luxury brand is quite silly.	1
	i could not give a hill of beans what the badge of the car is if it's well made, looks sharp, rides well and has features i like.	1
	i remember when honda was not highly regarded but built quality cars and eventually caught the public's attention.	1
	i'm a perfect demographic for hyundai.	1
	someone who would like to buy up without the lexus price tag.	1
	honestly i hope that hyundai never fully achieves 'luxury' status with a lexus or mercedes because if it does then the car will no longer be within the reach of my demographic.	1
	so finally a car that gives incredible value for the dollar.       	1

	at 51, i actually considered buying something a little nicer/more expensive -ie.	1
	moving up.	1
	i've been following this thread for sometime and following the writings on the car.	1
	i went to the hyundai dealer (never been to one before) with the sole purpose of giving serious consideration to a genesis.	1
	the place was spotless, but  i was ignored by all the salesmen except one.	1
	he seemed inconvenienced to talk to me, but was friendly and helpful.	1
	unfortunately, he knew very little about the genesis.	1
	from my short time with him, it is my guess that he'd never opened the door of a genesis prior to my visit.	1
	that was enough for me!	1
	you get one chance to make a first impression.	1
	i have always felt the best you will ever be treated at a dealership is by the salespeople and if this was how i was going to be treated when i wanted to purchase a vehicle that it would not be a pleasant experience in dealing with that business in the future.	1
	should i decide to 'move up' it won't be with the genesis.	1
	there's simply too much available.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3538#msg3538re: one of the problems with the genesis [captain2]        it's not a maybe but a fact.	1
	hyundai has already expressed a separate marque for north america is out of question for the near future.	1
	this (under the hyundai umbrella) is the way.	1
	actually, i see a lot of good things spring from the genesis line (sedan and coupe) under hyundai, aside from the competitive products themselves.	1
	consider the intangible benefits that would transfer to other fleet within the company; consider the elevation of the overall image and consumer perception; consider...                                it is probably too soon to grade the genesis sedan, but the early verdict has been good, despite the status of the economy.	1
	consumers have been purchasing $30k+ hyundais, something unheard-of just a few short years ago.	1
	during last month in the us, the genesis fared pretty well vs. the japanese luxury competitors:                                infinit m - 1,077 units sold                hyundai genesis - 1,029 units sold                lexus gs (inc. hybrid model) - 977 units sold                acrua rl - 259 units sold                                and, last but certainly not least, with regards to the genesis being a luxury car - simply put, it is a luxury car - easiest decision i had to make today.	1
	the industry professionals thought the same thing so if anyone doesn't                 perceive                the genesis being as such, then you owe it to yourself to at least find out more information about the car, a test drive would be recommended        	1

	the genesis is a luxury car wanabe (just like that phaeton (or millenia) were) and will continue to be as long as it is labelled and sold as it is and also regardless of how much lincoln-like bling they put on it , the lincolns are simply luxury car atrocities!i/                                     utter rubbish.	1

	they are approx 167 miles from you and show to have a white on black premium plus package 3.8 v6.	1
	and sandy, to answer your question, yes the shipments from hyundai have slowed somewhat.	1
	the first allocation that i have seen with genesi on it came out late last week.	1
	that means that dealers are operating on the initial orders that they placed back in april and may.	1
	if your dealers didn't order very many, or if the genesis has been a good seller in your area, then things will continue to be a bit thin for another couple of weeks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3555#msg3555re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [marvin6]        if that's how you feel about one dealership then go somewhere else.	1
	also, if you have been following the posts here, you'll know that hyundai will only be training a handful of salespeople from each dealership to sell the genesis.	1
	that is their dedication to make sure interested consumers are educated about their flagship.	1
	if you're going to let one meezly dealership prevent you from getting a great car and at a great value, then you're seriously not considering this vehicle.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3556#msg3556re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [bigelm]         you'll know that hyundai will only be training a handful of salespeople from each dealership to sell the genesis.	1
	not sure as the validity to that statement.	1
	i think it's more up to each dealership as to how many sales people will get the genesis training.	1
	the dealership i frequent, i noticed that the sales folks all have something sitting on their desks saying they've received the genesis training.	1
	to be honest though...the only thing a sales person has to do is just read up on the darn thing.	1
	i'm sure there are a handful of folks that post in this forum that could go in and do a better job of selling a genesis than most of the hyundai sales people.	1
	i know jeffreid is one of the few that makes sure his staff is well equipped with what they need to sell their product and i'm sure there are other managers like him as well, but...there's a great many that don't care one way or the other.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3557#msg3557re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [allmet33]        allmet is correct on this point.	1
	hma is not doing much of anything on their own in terms of genesis (or anything else) training.	1
	that is a dealer to dealer type thing.	1
	i just thought it would be a good idea to have some dedicated people to this product since most of the prospective buyers will most likely have elevated expectations from the 'usual' hyundai customer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3558#msg3558re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [jeffreid]        it takes time to change peoples perception of a brand and it's presence in the marketplace.	1
	12 years ago, lexus was looked at as a 'bargin' luxury car to compete with the the germans.	1
	now an ls460 is $80,000 and no bargain anymore.	1
	some over 100k.	1
	never thought i'd see the value in a 100k lexus, or that people who actually buy them.	1
	hyundai is a in a far better positon that what vw was trying to do with the phaeton.	1
	going from 30k cars to 80k ones is too much of a stretch for one brand.	1
	but sonatas that sticker for 28k to 40k genesis' is not that big of a leap.	1
	people are looking for a reason for the genesis to fail.	1
	the koreans can make a car every bit as good as the japanese.	1
	they might not be 100% there, but they are getting really close.	1
	the car market is really tough right now, and it's probably bad timing with the genesis to do bang-up sales numbers.	1
	but over the long haul, it's a good car for them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3559#msg3559re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [jeffreid]        in short, don't get mad at hyundai for the sales folks not being knowlegable about the genesis.	1
	afterall, they are providing the opportunity for the sales people to learn.	1
	it would be the fault of the particular dealership if their sales staff isn't up to snuff on any of their product.	1
	in the end, the sales person suffers due to lack of sales and in turn, the dealership suffers as well.	1
	so, if you have a problem with the staff's lack of knowledge...raise cain with the sales manager or even the store owner because ultimately...an ignorant staff equals moeny lost!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3560#msg3560re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [bigelm]        this one dealership is the only hyundai dealership near me and would be the dealership i would return to for service.	1
	i reiterate - i believe the best treatment one will ever get at a dealership is with the sales department.	1
	i am not interested in playing games with a car dealership - particularly if they are interested in marketing a 'luxyury vehicle'.	1
	as a consumer, i assume that a 'luxury vehicle' comes with a 'luxury dealership'.	1
	i am only one customer and it is not a great loss.	1
	but i can tell you that i did visit a lexus dealership and will probably go that route - proven luxury from the past and demonstrated luxury service in the present.	1
	i plan to take my wife there for the second vote of a two vote decision.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3561#msg3561re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [marvin6]        my hyundai dealership has 3-4 sales people and at least two went to the 'genesis school,' which was conducted by hyundai at their regional hq.	1
	i found both to be very knowledgeable about the cars.	1
	my experience with many dealerships has been that the sales people know the least about the cars.	1
	same at the lexus dealership.	1
	acura and infiniti sales people seem more stable and far more knowledgeable.	1
	around here most dealerships seem to change sales people about as often as i change socks.	1
	have a neighbor who has gone from buick to used car to chevrolet in the last 3 years.	1
	worst experience i have had in last five years of going to eight differenet dealerships was with lexus.	1
	ignored in show room, no contact after the demo ride, failed to provide information when requested, etc.	1
	coffee wasn't that good either.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3562#msg3562re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [marvin6]        ultimately...one should deal with the place they feel comfortable with.	1
	i can tell you now, not all sales departments get it and you can get better treatment with the service department.	1
	think about it...in some cases, they don't think about someone being a repeat buyer of a vehicle, but...they would certainly bring their vehicle there for service, which will happen more frequently than someone buying a car.	1
	in my case, the dealership i go to...the sales department is okay, but the service department is top notch.	1
	i've been going there for 6 years now ('02 sonta  currently my '06 azera) and the staff takes the time to get to know who they are dealing with so each visit feels personal.	1
	they also know how you like to take care of your vehicle and make sure to keep that in mind when servicing your car or making repairs.	1
	i bought my sonata from this dealer, but when it came time for me to get my azera...they didn't do enough to get me into one there.	1
	went to another dealer and bought it, getting the deal i was looking for and more on my trade in, but went back to the intial dealer for my service needs.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3563#msg3563        captain et al: you guys are validating your own argument to a great degree because there will be people who will continue to refuse to see genesis as a luxury vehicle because it comes from hyundai.	1
	but at the same time, as can be gathered from vociferous dissent in this forum, there will be others who will see genesis as a luxury product based on its features regardless of the hyundai marque.	1
	there can really be nofruitful argument on this subject as long as each side tries to extrapolate its own thought into the market at large.	1
	you just have to wait and see.	1
	and it's interesting to note that industry generally agrees that the maybach experiment was a failure.	1
	you can see it two ways:  either as the marque being irrelevant for the ultimate success of the brand, or it being all-important as no other marque except the olde english brands having the sufficient cachet for the ultra-luxury brand.	1
	i just think maybach simply did not stand out.	1
	when lexus first came out, it actually broadened the luxury market by pulling lower the entry point.	1
	into this relative vacuum the traditional luxury brands such as bmw and mb eventually expanded to fill by offering lower priced, previously europe only models.	1
	go to germany and see if the bmw brand is considered a luxury brand in substantially the same way as in the us.	1
	in short, no.	1
	in germany, bmw is just a car company.	1
	there are some bmw models that induce equal amount of drool to germans and americans alike, but by and large, bmw is just another nice car maker.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3564#msg3564re: genesis comments [jeffreid]        as stated, i am looking for a v8 with white exterior.	1
	if we buy a v6 it will be a toyota avalon.. for the greater power of a v8, i want a rear wheel drive car such as the chrysler 300c, the pontiac g8 gt, or the genesis v8.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3565#msg3565re: genesis - a chance for some to buy into luxury [allmet33]        you are correct...when i said hyundai, i was referring more to the dealer.	1
	also, it's up to the salesperson to be knowledgeable enough to sell the product.	1
	imho, lexus is just a glorified toyota.	1
	it's an appliance car with some bells and whistles.	1
	- like i said, my opinion.	1
	with the money you spend on a lexus, you better be damn sure they should treat you with top notch service.	1
	i know of a dealership who is making it their priority to get the right people to sell this car and provide exceptional service.	1
	so, though the experiences vary from dealer to dealer, there are some out there that want to make a difference.	1
	btw marvin, i'm also waiting for a satin white pearl v8 fully loaded.	1
	the whites are barely starting to show up.	1
	heck, the v8's are now starting to appear at dealerships (depending on region).       	1

	i'd love to keep people guessing what the car is.	1
	it's been fun to come out of stores and have guys standing around it with a puzzled look...saying 'this is a hyundai?'	1
	thanks for any help.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3567#msg3567wow!	1
	i just spent close to an hour weeding through 130+ posts on whether the genesis is a 'luxury' car or not.	1
	clearly, the definition of luxury depends on who is defining the term.	1
	allmet, i think you are dead on accurate with your 'blue collar luxury' point.	1
	i see the genesis aimed more at folks who don't have the budget for a 5 series or a ls460 but who want the looks and features that those type vehicles offer.	1
	folks like me, blue collar middle class joe 6 pack who otherwise will buy a non-luxury or near-luxury maxima, tl, passat, 300c etc.	1
	absent hyundai's $34-40k v6 genesis.	1
	i haven't driven one yet as my purchase is still almost a year away, but i have a feeling that the genesis is exactly what i am looking for:  a nice 'affordable' 'luxury' car that provides a 'luxury' ride with 'luxury' features that is still sporty enough to not look as if it belongs at the retirement home.	1
	i am not looking to impress anyone but                 me                and i am not deterred by the fact that the genesis doesn't wear a lexus/mb/bmw badge.	1
	so, i guess put my vote in the corner that says admission to 'luxury' status has more to do with the individual car than what badge is on the trunk lid.	1
	people who say that admission to luxury status derives from the brand, in my opinion, would be those more focused on image and status.	1
	they wouldn't seriously consider anything outside of the typical tier 1 brands anyway as nothing else will provide the image and pampering that they want.	1
	i am                 not                saying that as a jab or as a judgment of those folks by any means.	1
	my wife clearly prefers the maxima and tl for no better reason than she can't get beyond the hyundai label, so probably no genesis for me.	1
	lexus/mb/bmw buyers apparently value the 'premium dealership experience' that ownership provides and that's just fine with me, more power to them.	1
	someone compared the cost of an oil change at lexus versus toyota.	1
	i personally would rather pay $30 at toyota and sit on a milk crate in the middle of the shop floor in july than spend $79 at the lexus dealer sitting on rich, corinthian leather eating croissants and cappuccino but, hey, that's just my opinion.	1
	ymmv.	1
	as far as sales not meeting expectations, geez, are                 any                $35-40k sedans flying off the lot right now?	1
	terrible timing for hyundai but i don't see how any judgments regarding success or failure can really be measured under the economic circumstances.       	1

	go to www.ebay.com                ebay motors under the parts and accessories section.	1
	type in 2009 hyundai genesis kdm emblem.	1

	17'  18'  center caps are there.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3570#msg3570re: wow!	1
	[traindriver]        traindriver...thank you for being one that understands what i was getting at.	1
	as far as the wife is concerned...go to the dealership on your own, but pick her up in the genesis during your test drive (if it's possible).	1
	she may still have a hard time getting past the hyundai label, but a ride in the genesis will definitely make her second guess her opinion.	1
	well...maybe.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3571#msg3571re: wow!	1
	[allmet33]        allmet, when the time comes to buy i will try to drag her to the hyundai dealership.	1
	i like your idea but the closest dealership is 50+ miles/1 hour away so i doubt they would let me take one on such an extended test drive.	1
	i would have it half the day.	1
	i have until august or september to change her mind but so far she's not giving in.	1
	i have the brochures for the maxima, tl, accord, g35, m35, s60, and the genesis.	1
	she will not touch the genesis brochure.	1
	it defies all logic that she apparently would rather drive an accord than a genesis.	1
	she is generally not materialistic and will readily wear walmart/target clothes but when it comes to cars, she gets picky and uppity.	1
	i qualify for the hyundai associate purchase program so i know that i could buy under invoice, making a good buy even better.	1
	oh well...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3572#msg3572re: wow!	1
	[traindriver]        traindriver...maybe by the time you're ready to make that move, they'll have enough genesi (lol) on the lot to allow for extended test drives.	1
	heck, when i bought my '02 azera, they handed me the key, told me to go pick up the wife and kids and come back whenever...same with my '06 azera.	1
	i would certainly pull the distance card on them and say, 'look...i drove 50 miles to get here, i think it's fair to allow me a good long drive to make sure this is the car i want as i'm considering the max, tl, etc.	1
	it seems that you don't have a defined size of car you're considering as your choices run from mid to large.	1
	all this and you qualify for an even greater discount on the genesis???	1
	talk about jealous.	1
	good luck with whatever move you make...your list is made up of all fine cars in their own right.	1
	i would think if the genesis is high on your list, but the wife insists against it...i would shoot for the m35/45.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3573#msg3573re: wow!	1
	[allmet33]        yeah, of the cars traindriver listed, the m35/45 are probably closest in spirit to the genesis.	1
	but even with the incentives infiniti is providing on the m, it's more expensive up front.	1
	will that difference be mirrored in resale value?	1
	hard to say so far.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3574#msg3574re: wow!	1
	[stephen987]        you're absolutely right, but this is more a case of him dealing with a wife that is against hyundai...so unless he can get her to even consider the genesis as an outside option when hades freezes over...it wouldn't even matter in this case.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3575#msg3575re: wow!	1
	[allmet33]        true.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3576#msg3576re: wow!	1
	[stephen987]        i do understand his plight to a degree.	1
	my wife wasn't exactly hyundai friendly at first either, but one thing she truly loves is the last two cars we've had have been hyundais and they have proven to be quite reliable and durable.	1
	she also loves the warranty too.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3577#msg3577re: wow!	1
	[allmet33]         i would think if the genesis is high on your list, but the wife insists against it...i would shoot for the m35/45.	1
	i really like the m35 also.	1
	at msrp, it's way more than i want to pay.	1
	from my research here and elsewhere, it appears significant discounts are available which could get the m into my comfort zone.	1
	i will probably shoot a couple of infiniti dealers an email and see where they stand in my area.	1
	if the general consensus is something like 'we'll take 2k off sticker if you buy in the next 48 hours' then i will probably hit delete and move on to something else rather quickly.	1
	if they come out aggressive on price from the start, i will get real interested real quick and move the m way up the list of contenders.	1
	a base model m35 at an msrp of $43k would give me all of the 'goodies' that i want anyway.	1
	(seems like i saw an ad in the charlotte paper awhile back offering 6 or 7k off, but i can't remember now)                                one concern i have is that when i checked the online inventories recently, all of the remaining m's were fairly heavily optioned and thus too pricey for me.	1
	i don't know how many low end models might be available, especially since we are both picky about colors.	1
	i will be buying around 'closeout' time, so i am confident that i would do well enough on whatever i end up with.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3578#msg3578re: wow!	1
	[traindriver]        well traindriver...now's an excellent time to make a move on an '08 model so i'm pretty sure you can work a sweet deal on one since they want to get rid of them to make room for the '09's.	1
	again...good luck!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3579#msg3579re: wow!	1

	[traindriver]        it's all good, same applies...just a year later.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3584#msg3584re: wow!	1
	[allmet33]        that approach sounds fine in theory and that is exactly the line of attack that i used on my wife.	1
	the hyundai folks let me take the car for a couple of hours and could not have been nicer.	1
	this was when they were first trickling in and i had to take a black one.	1
	i surprised my wife around noon (no, not that !).	1
	she came out with a big frown on her face, circled the car a time or two and pronounced that she did not like black cars.	1
	i said they came in different colors so not to worry, this was just a tester.	1
	she got in the passenger seat and we took a spin.	1
	she was sitting ramrod straight, arms crossed and a look on her face like someone was holding a small turd under her nose.	1
	i knew all was lost at that point and it would not have mattered if we were driving a rolls royce.	1
	it was not her idea so it had to be a bad idea !	1
	as plans go, i agree this is a good one...but it reminds me of the time some guy was interviewing mike tyson back when he was in his hey day.	1
	the guy said that his next opponent had said that he would beat tyson in their upcoming fight because he had a plan !	1
	tyson replied that everyone he fought had a plan.....until they got hit !	1
	long story short, i really liked the genesis and thought it was very impressive.	1
	a really nice car and based on my short test i would certainly recommend to anyone to at least give it a shot.....but i am still driving my '02 acura rl.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3585#msg3585        m35s for 33k sounds just a bit too good to be true, are these right off the showroom or are they demos, etc?	1
	it's a great time to buy a g35 since the new g37sedans are just now starting to trickle in.	1
	i know the g is quite different than the m and the genesis, but imo they are the most fun sedan for 35k or less.	1
	the genesis is a very nice ride and every time i see one (which has only been about 6 times since we're in a smaller city) i have to give it a second look, and yes, they should be considerd luxury in the same league as the higher priced lexusinfinity vehicles.	1
	our previous hyundai sonata limited was a fine vehicle, and for the price it's tough to beat.	1
	if i don't go w/ another infinity g i may look into the genesis coupe when the time comes, since it may be more in line w/ the gs sporting nature.	1
	i am one of those that has a hard time overcoming the 'hyundai as luxury'                nomenclature, but thy have proven that they are building vehicles at a much higher quality level than just a few short years ago, and they take all the right stuff from every other manufacturer they are trying to emulate  compete against.       	1

	assuming they are being sold as new, in other words, not one with thousands of miles on the od (i.e.	1
	demo), 33k does not bold well for the dealership, neither to the car brand.	1
	if hyundai can sell a good amount of units of the genesis, w/ relatively little discount, mind you, and even during the whole economic turmoil, then i don't think infiniti and/or the dealer would be so desperate to resort discounting 10k+ on the m (assuming it's the barebone m35, which starts around 44k, iirc).	1

	[joe97]        joe97,                                you need to scroll down the main page at bradshaw to see the special:  44325 msrp - 11375 discount = 32950.  you missed the 'sahara sandstone' in the inventory for 44325.                                other nc/sc/ga dealers:                you need to dig around a little but most are on the 'specials' page                                infiniti of charlotte:  7521 off                south atlanta: up to 12k off                gwinnett: 33498                crossroads:  8k off                modern:  up to 10k off                                edmunds incentives page shows 6000 mfr to dealer cash and a 1500 'sell down' bonus.	1
	(whatever that is;  never heard that term before)  i assume this means a total of $7500 mfr to dealer cash before you begin to negotiate any                 dealership                discount off of sticker.	1
	it seems possible to see a +/- 10k discount for an educated negotiator.	1
	might be demos, might be smoke and mirrors -- i can't say with any authority.	1
	anyway, we probably need to drift back towards discussion of the genesis;  makes the hosts antsy when we get out of a narrow range.	1
	edit: i see a handfull of 08 m35's on ebay with miles in the low teens for 27xxx to 30xxx -- so 33-36k for a new one doesn't seem out of line.	1
	there's also 2 new genesis in ohio on ebay:  36k msrp, buy it now for 33276 plus 275 fee.	1

	[stanco]        i hope that you don't think i am a genesis basher;  if so you need to go back and reread my posts over the last day or two.	1
	i think it is a fine car, especially for what it offers at its price point.	1
	i also agree that the bashers should state their case and move on.	1
	i see it in many of the model-specific forums here on edmunds.	1
	where i might disagree is that, for whatever reason, the hosts don't particularly  like it when conversations drift from the topic at hand.	1

	i think it is good reading to include comparisons and extraneous information on other models so that everyone can make their own judgments on what is available out there.	1
	otherwise, you only need a few folks with positive viewpoints and a few with negative to state their case and then block the discussion to any further comment.	1
	what else remains to be said?	1
	if the conversation about the m35 annoyed you, i apologize -- i am not quite sure from the tone of your message whether you are directing ire towards me for posting a few messages about the m35 or whether you were making a general statement that you are tired of people continually bashing a certain model and refusing to let it go.	1

	[stanco]        i too have not bashed the genesis other than the center console and the wheels, but every car has at least a couple things that not everyone likes.	1
	the m35 info shouldn't offfend the gen nation, it's probably the most comparable car, and the fact that it's mentioned in a hyundai thread should make the hyundai buyers all that more secure in their choice to purchase the gen. maybe some sensitivity training is in order        	1

	if anyone that's truly considering the genesis, all they have to do is read the comparison that was done (captain won't like this one bit).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3603#msg3603finally, got the v8 at the right lease...        i have been working almost two weeks with one dealer that would not budge on the lease and they had silver / black interior (with the saddle trim that did not care much for) as  they had the first v8 genesis and they were very proud of it...                                yesterday i switched dealers that had right interior color combo (tan / black leather trim) and champaign color, also they were a lot more accommodating on the lease term.	1
	don't get me wrong, i know the economy is bad, but i left some money on the table, i wanted the dealer to make a little living and felt that the price of having not wait for months for the 'right deal' is worth the extra $ ...                                the way i looked at it, i am paying for 2 year interest free loan, i already like the car and most likely i will make an offer on it at the end of the 24 month lease..                                in the last month, i went back and drove 528i / 535i, m35, lexus gs but could not get the right deal  on a car that comparable with a fully loaded v8 genesis, not to mention at some stage if one likes a particular car might as well go for it...you only live once!	1
	i have been fortunate  to have a good dealer experience, they even got the sales manger i was working to make sure everything went smoothly.	1
	on sunday night i might add!...	1
	now to the car; the car drives much better that the v8 i test drove back in september, the drive is firm but very composed, i love how the interior lights up at night, everything works together very well indeed.	1
	the v8 power is evident thought out the rpm range, although one must watch the needle because the car is so quite, even the mrs was in the back seat mentioned i know it is a new car!, but why are you going at 35?, i answered; dear, i will get a ticket i go any faster than 60mph !!..	1
	the one gripe i had with demo / v6 was the rear base speaker was exposed!	1
	well they listened intently and hyundai got that fixed, so the lining on the v8 truck looks much, much better...                                i suppose i should take my leave and switch over to the genesis owners forum, although i have enjoyed being part of this forum and wish you all luck in you next car purchase...       	1

	also, is the gearing in the v8 transmission taller than the transmission in the v6?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3606#msg3606genesis october sales        hyundai moved nearly 1200 genesi in october.... more than tucson, tiburon, azera and veracruz and half as many as accent.	1
	i'd say hyundai has a great offering on their hand considering the economy and fuel prices.	1
	hyundai overall sales were down 31%, which is par for the course for automakers in september.	1
	i will agree that hyundai has likely cannibalized azera sales with the genesis but sales are not the only objective of the genesis offering.	1
	it's also about enhancing brand image.	1
	and it definitely accomplishing that for hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3607#msg3607re: finally, got the v8 at the right lease... [bman900]         since you have driven both the v6 and the v8 genesis models, can you list some of the differences you noticed in the power, smoothness, handling, etc?	1
	in my opinion the v8 trumps the v6 on several levels;                                comfort/esthetics;                                first the leather is much softer.	1
	which translates to more comfort, (as an example less sticky in hotter weather) also the seat is a little firmer.	1
	the little touches; for example; the side chrome bar, the back light door sill.	1
	small things but it does add to the pleasure of the driving experience.	1
	ride/power                                i can truly describe the v8 as a sports sedan because it is firmer and more composed than the v6 (also the ride is tuned much better than the demo v8s they had in the discover genissis tour') .	1
	the car handling is very precise, let me put it this way, my brother in law commented; this car drives as if it is on magnetic / air suspended rails.	1
	the steering is very precise with some road feedback but not as harsh as bmw 5/infiniti m45 however it is firmer than the lexus gs 350. while i would describe the v6 (premium plus) to much closer to lexus gs ride.	1
	the steering radius is incredible on the v8, for example, i can dive in a shape of an 8 at the end of a cal-de-sac.!	1
	the steering turns more than two revolutions in either direction without any effort, at more than 70% angle!?	1
	i took 90 turn at 30mph angle turn without the slightest hint of body roll.	1
	i am sure the car tilted i just did not feel it.	1
	i would say the electric powered steering does make a huge difference!	1
	the v8 vehicle appears to anticipate the driving mode, i am beginning to get to used it!	1
	if you slowly press the gas pedal half way, then floor it, the car takes off and you are doing 80 before you know it.	1
	if you try it floor it from a standstill, the traction / stability control kicks and power is greatly reduced which results in rather unpredictable acceleration pattern that takes the computers anything from 2 to 3 seconds to correct!	1
	i have not had the chance to drive on an interstate yet!	1
	but in manual mode at 75mph, it was in third gear at 4500 rpm, so indeed, the zf does appear to provide taller gears.	1
	the tech package is yummy, but if i had to choose the v6 tech vs. the v8 (premium) i would choose the v8 in heart beat, (but that is me!                )	1
	if i had to grade both vehicles, say v6  v8 tech (and i drove both techs + a v6 premium) ..subjective observations, i would come with;                                v 6   ---  v8                power low end   --   7/10 --  10/10 (under ideal acceleration conditions)                power high end  --   8/10 --  9/10   (manual mode).	1
	smoothness l/e --   7/10 --   9/10                smoothness h/e --   6/10 --  10/10                over all handling  --   8/10 --  10/10                                hope that answers your questions        	1

	personally...i feel they should leave it alone.	1
	agreed, many manufacturers are having some drivability issues with these high multiple gear trannies.	1
	both genesis engines are plenty flexible enough (torque wise) to live quite happily with 6 (or even 5 speeds), an 8 speed is for those folks that think more must be better,.	1
	logically it should be more expensive to repair and more likely to break simply because it is more complicated.	1
	as toyota has proven with the jump to a 6 speed from a 5 speed in the avalon, for example, there may be no gain in fe and they did experience some teething problems with those early 6 speeds.	1
	if hyundai decides to put an 8 speed in a future genesis beware!	1
	hyundai is not changing its quality image appreciably (reference cr 12-08) and any serious tranny problem, for example, would only serve to work against what they are working for.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3618#msg3618re: 8-speed tranny on the way [captain2]        we don't even know the source of this 8-speed transmission yet.	1
	but likely it's not going to be hyundai.	1
	the two trannies used in the current genesis are not made by hyundai, for example.	1
	so 'beware!'	1
	warnings about the future 8at are a little premature i think.	1
	if people wanted a simple car, with fewer things to break, they would not be even thinking about a car in this class.	1

	for 2010, genesis v-8 models will be mated to an all-new eight-speed transmission.	1
	unlike the present six-speed transmission offered with the 4.6-liter tau v-8, the eight-speed transmission is not a zf design, but one designed and fabricated entirely by hyundai.	1
	though not yet announced, were betting the v-6 genesis model will stay with the six-speed automatic, which comes from aisin.	1
	the eight-speed matches the number of speeds offered on the lexus ls, beats that of most mercedes-benz models by one, and will match that of the bmw  5- and 7-series, when those ranges begin using zfs eight-speed transmission.	1

	but with your $1,900.00 in savings your price will be $35,713.00, that's over $4,200.00 in savings.	1
	this is bad news not good, indicating that just maybe that a hyundai dealer is not where folks go to spend $35 large.	1
	this just a few short months after it became available and also became about the most advertised vehicle around.	1
	can you imagine what's happening to those first few souls that paid something close to msrp for the thing - they are being rewarded (like most hyundai owners are) with a car with bad resale values, not good for hyundai and not good for the genesis owner.	1

	we know what the article says, but we don't know if the details are correct.	1
	for all we know, the photographer just walked up and saw the genesis coupe all crashed up and went from there, he/she may have never spoken to the actual driver to know if he/she was an owner or someone test driving for the company or what.	1
	for that, we have to take it with a grain of salt.	1
	it's a shame to see it as it is and ultimately...we do see that the air bags didn't deploy and clearly...should have.	1
	however, i've never heard of hyundai having an issue with air bag deployment, well...lack thereof.	1
	if anything, they've had recalls to deal with sensors to be replaced so that air bags wouldn't deploy inadvertently.       	1

	this happens all the time with new models... it is hardly unique to the genesis, or hyundai.	1
	just as hyundai offering the genesis at a good discount is hardly unique in the luxury sedan market right now.	1
	remember the posts from people talking about huge discounts available on other luxury cars, e.g.	1
	infinitis and audis?	1
	what amazes me is that hyundai was able to hold off this long before putting big discounts on the genesis, given economic conditions as they are.	1
	and there are still no factory rebates on the car... which not many other luxury sedans can say.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3635#msg3635re: discounts on genesis [backy]        i wonder if the discount merely discounts the high-profit margin of a dual premium and technology package combo?	1
	if so, the same cited $4,200 savings on a base model may be hard to obtain.	1
	please advise if i err.	1
	meanwhile, still no personal luck in locating a satin pearl white 4.6 v8 with cashmere interior and  no technology package.	1

	heck, i am seeing 10k off or more on gs, m, etc, this is generous.	1
	as for those owners paid at or above msrp earlier on the genesis - that was nothing new, as it is the general trend for new cars.	1
	as for the bad resale values, you know this how?	1
	fwiw, the predicted residual for the genesis has been fantastic, beating out others in the class, even though luxury vehicles depreciate like a rock in general across the board.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3638#msg3638autoblog tests genesis        this sums it all:                                 the all-new hyundai genesis sets a unique tone among our garaged vehicles.	1
	it's not the fastest, smoothest, most comfortable or most luxurious.	1
	it's not the most aerodynamic, innovative or technically advanced.	1
	what makes the flagship hyundai memorable is its accuracy.	1
	while automakers are constantly shooting arrows into new segments hoping they will stick, few are able to hit their intended mark with their first shot.	1
	hyundai has done it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3639#msg3639re: check this out [joe97]        submitted by an anonymous poster:                                 i work on both airbags and steering wheels for a living, and believe me, the steering wheel is supposed to bend.	1
	if it was stiff, it would cause even more damage to the occupant.	1
	with the steering wheel being bent the way it is, though, that tells me the person was unbelted.	1
	which is stupid step number one.	1
	also, with the angle crash appears to have occurred, it's right in between a side and a frontal crash.	1
	it's likely not that the airbags failed to go of -- the computer that collects the data and determines if it is a good course of action probably decided a 'no-deploy' was the best case.	1
	airbags help, for sure, but can sometimes do more harm than good.	1
	if you're incorrectly seated, unbelted, etc., they can induce injuries you may otherwise have not sustained.	1
	that's why you should always wear your seatbelt!	1
	airbags work with seatbelts as a system for the maximum safety effects.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3640#msg3640re: genesis october sales [beer4704]        that is very true.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3642#msg3642re: genesis october sales [tjc78]        i live in the chicago suburbs and have seen two different genesi on the road w/o dealer plates.	1
	they were different colors so i know they were different units.	1
	and i've either seen the silver one twice or there are two of those in the area; i'm guessing it's the same one.	1
	so far they're rare but not unheard of.	1
	if they sell a few more i imagine i'll see them just as often as i see the azera, which is not all that often - once or twice a week at best.	1
	but that's fine for a car that should offer a degree of exclusivity.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3643#msg3643re: discounts on genesis [marvinlee1]        hyundai has not yet released the v8 car in the white color.	1
	the brochures do show that the color is available, and it will be                 eventually                                i also would have to agree that the discounts that are being quoted would not add up the same way on a base model car.	1
	since it was listed as $1900 under invoice you would just see the difference of the lesser markup in the base car in the total discount.	1
	i would guess maybe the dealer has a bunch of genesis inventory sitting around???	1
	we have kept our stock to no more than 2 at a time and have (so far) been able to keep pricing at msrp.	1
	of course, right now if some one came in and made almost any offer over invoice i would probably take it.	1

	btw, i have no clue what this strange icon is on my post, must be a default...it's not my car...                                this car is absolutely incredible.	1
	after break in (600 miles) popped it to 140 mph like nothing.. not even sure what it's top end is.	1
	going 100-120 mph feels like 60 mph.	1
	smooth and secure.	1
	handling is, imho, that of a sports luxury car... i've already smoked bmw's, lexus', cadillac sts's, audis.. you name it.	1
	i'm on the road very early (light traffic) and you can find other enthusiasts to play around with, respectably... no one can/has stay with me.	1
	when i see them step on the gas to try to 'show me what they have' they obviously have a few second lead and even with that i'm passing them in a matter of seconds.	1
	the sound system is insane, might as well have the allman brothers in the car with me, sounds the same.	1
	navigation system, incredibly accurate.	1
	blows away my magellan majesto i paid $400 for less than a year ago.	1
	phone and bluetooth pairing is automatic and sound quality for me and the other person is great.	1
	upgraded the xm to get howard stern (sirius upgrade package), took me 15 minutes on the phone, piece of cake...                                click off the esc and i'm smoking the tires and i feel like i'm 16 again with my old mustang, except the handling is obviously another story.	1
	gas mileage is outstanding (solid 25-26 hwy)... when i drive the speed limit.	1
	otherwise i'm still in the 18 -20 range between my 'spurts' of 'driving' this car as it can be driven.	1
	if you have a few extra g's, i highly recommend the v8 over the v6.	1
	the power, options, handling and overall driving experience are just too good to be true...at $40k ??	1
	jeez... and people will still buy a 'brand name' for $20k more.. ego's run riot, this is a great car and hyundai is clearly making great strides.	1
	btw, i'm not a salesman (i re-read my post and i sure sound like one...just stating the facts as i experience them), i'm a cfo, so i look for value  results... this car is value and results...performance       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3652#msg3652saw 2 of them        i just saw 2 non-dealer genesises on the road (lake elsinore, on collier and 74).	1
	the first one seemed to be silver (it was twilight, so hard to tell), and i only caught the rear-left quadrant.	1
	at first i thought it was a bimmer 5 series, but knew something was different.	1
	turned my head as it passed to my left, and sure enough, the 'flying h' was prominently displayed.	1
	the second one was just minutes later, a beautiful light-blue.	1
	again, wasn't sure what it was, and thought it was a lexus ls for a while just based on the taillights, then noticed that some details were definitely not lexus.	1
	moved up right behind it to take a picture with my cell phone, and sure enough, saw the 'flying h.' i passed it on the right, and it was an elderly couple, with the lady driving.	1
	if i am not mistaken, she had a big smile on her face - not surprised.	1

	for the people that matters to (like yourself) you won't be buying anyway.	1
	there are many mercedes and lexus owners who have made the switch.	1

	because they see not only quality but value in the purchase.	1
	it's unfortunate you don't open your eyes and mind that it could be possible to produce a quality luxury car that's not a german brand.	1

	i havent been on in almost two years.	1
	yet i read a lot of this.	1
	i have a ls 430 and a loaner es 350 for about two weeks.	1
	thanks to a deer.	1
	i went out and drove everything almost.	1
	the v-6 v-8 rear drive genesis is very very nice for the money.	1
	i believe the v-6 makes more engine noise then the v-8  certainly around town.	1
	i thought i could go down to a ls 350 in size not so sure now.	1
	highway road noise or lack of  it is important to me.	1
	i only drove the hg around town.	1
	i would like to drive the v-8 at 60 to 70 to hear it.	1
	any thoughts on these ideas?	1
	i checked all spec and they are so very close to ls 430. thanks  happy thanksgiving       	1

	[carguyay]        mr. carguyay : hello and happy thanksgiving .	1
	the spelling of your name is quite unique .	1
	it contours to look like it means ... ' car guy , from uraguay , has to look , but with one eye . '	1
	is that you ?	1
	nah ... i doubt it ...                any way :                here is some stuff you knew anyway .	1
	.... you can't replace the ls 430 , unless you buy used .	1
	the es 350 is a backbreaker for me ... and alot of folks i know .	1
	the drivers seat feels good until a g force pins the lower back on some cheap camry construction coils wrapped around the hot seat wires .	1
	junk .	1
	---- the 6 cyl.	1
	genisus is plenty .	1
	there is double pane glass in that vehicle ( exactly like a s 550 mercedes ) ... you can't hear nothing , unless your hearing aid is cranked up full and the window is open .	1
	it's one of the quietest vehicles made .	1
	the genisus has dunlap d 5000 v rated tires ... the exact tires that cme on your ls 430 when it was new  ( retail about $ 225 us a tire ) ,made in japland .	1
	i drove the  genisis  at 138 mph at dover downs for an hour straight , andf the vehicle wanted more punishment .... it was begging me .	1
	the six has a 6 speed jap xmission , and the 8 has a zf nazi xmisssion .	1
	the 6 speed jap has less chance of failure .	1
	the zf responfds to very little .	1
	it is programmed to shift when it decides .	1
	it doesn't know from 'fuzzy logic' .	1
	the 6 speed ( 6 cyl ) jap xmission can decide between yes and no on an up or doenshift , as it has jap fuzzy logic , and can distinguish that it does not have to think in only 1 or 2 ... it has a maybe also .	1
	agreed the specs are close on the genisis to the ls 430 .... but the genisis beats the ls to smitherines .	1
	... the genisis has the electric motor power steering like the ls 460 (l ) , the ls 430 is still hydraulic fluid .	1
	the engine is quiet on regular fuel , unless the dot head who sold you the gasoline puts 20 % water in his tank at 3 in the morning , to rip the guts out of his host country citizens .	1
	if you are a serious buyer ... buy the genisis .	1
	lexus is $ 75 k with a levinson radio , and i have had one '07 and two '08's , and they are good until break in at 2000 miles , then go doenhill and burn gas .	1
	enjoyed talking to you ... best of luck in your new genisis ... hurry up , the price is going up in $ 2000 increnments starting jan 3 , 2009 .	1

	as the article i posted states, the 8-speed is coming                 in the future.	1
	the genesis v8 currently has the zf 6-speed transmission with a 3.133:1 final drive ratio:                                 http://www.hyundaigenesis.com/library/hynd_bh_webspecs07.pdf        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3676#msg3676re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [dean3927]        some people, not a lot, but some have said that the genesis is overpriced.	1
	in a recent car and driver article they tested the genesis against the 5-series bmw, chrysler 300c, and the toyota avalon.	1
	of course they liked the bmw better because of it's sportier handling.	1
	but hands down, they liked it better than the chrysler, and they liked it even better than the avalon.	1
	my brother own a avalon limited and has never liked hyundai's, but has absolutely fallen in love with the genesis.	1
	the article said that for around the same money as a xls avalon you could get the genesis, and they seemed to think it would be a better buy and i think so too.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3677#msg3677re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [joshuag]        i really wouldn't feed into that whole notion of folks thinking the genesis is overpriced.	1
	the majority that think like that simply want it to be cheaper because of the fact it's a hyundai.	1
	also, they wan't one badly, but they don't have the backbone to stand up to family and friends and justify why they spent almost $40k on a hyundai.	1
	considering the car has been directly compared to the lexus gs and it was basically said that the genesis offered almost everything (gadget for gadget, option for option  feature for feature) as the gs at a considerable savings, and yet nobody is crying about the gs being overpriced.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3678#msg3678aftermarket bliss        seems like aftermarket tuner companies are taking a liking to the genesis.	1
	first dub creates two slick rides for the sema show and now this...                                                 rides magazine creates custom hyundai genesis for sema                                i picked up the latest rides magazine and saw the article on this...sweet!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3679#msg3679re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [allmet33]         that whole notion of folks thinking the genesis is overpriced.	1
	that's just it - in an absolute hardware for the dollar perspective - the genesis is                 underpriced                as most hyundai offerings are.	1
	from a perception standpoint and relative to                 where                it is sold it is overpriced.	1
	if you think about it there are very very few manufacturers that can successfully sell a $40k car alongside a $10k one.	1
	thinking about that a little further some of those 'japanese' brands may be the only ones to successfully pull that off - and they had to come up with new brands (and dealers)  to do it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3680#msg3680re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [captain2]        captain, once again your points fall short.	1
	#1)  bottom line...what you get for your dollar in the genesis is truly hard to beat.	1
	it has clearly been proven that you would have to pay $10k or more to get the very same things the genesis offers in comparison to the premium sedans.	1
	granted, you can't put a price on luxury sentiment, but we're talking tangibles.	1
	#2)  volkswagen is doing the very thing you claim can't be done.	1
	rabbits sell for around $15k and the toureg 2 in v8 form sells for almost $50k.	1
	the sonata tops out around $25k, the azera tops out around $30k and you can get into a base genesis for $33k and fully loaded for just under $40k.	1
	i bet you would just love it if the genesis were sold for the same price as the azera, huh?	1
	with the progressions hyundai has made, why do you continually believe that they are unable to 'do it'??	1
	?       	1

	hmmmm?	1
	the korean won has lost 40% of its value against the us dollar since july and hyundai is going to raise prices?	1
	the won is at its lowest point in fourteen years.	1
	perhaps they will raise prices in the korean won but i think it's unlikely they will raise prices in us dollars.	1
	more likely the price will drop in us dollars.	1
	i'm not saying anything negative about this car i own one.	1
	it is absolutley the best car i have ever had at any price but i think it likely the price will come down in january not up.	1
	most likely some dealer is blowing smoke, trying to pressure you into buying now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3683#msg3683re: yeah but it's a hyundai [tjn007]        my point is clear and obvious, they should have changed the name.	1
	if they had re-badged it, it wouldnt be embarassing to drive.	1
	let's be real and recognize that americans like brand names - we like coach, gucci, mercedes-- it doesn't have much to do with quality or logic, it's the emotion of elitism.	1
	had hyundai changed the name, they would have had a contender.	1
	short of that, noone - and i mean noone is going to trade in a mercedes for a hyundai.	1
	if anyone has done that please speak up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3684#msg3684re: yeah but it's a hyundai [raycharles1]        obviously you haven't been in a genesis of any trim level.	1
	it's hardly embarassing to drive.	1
	you are right about one thing, many americans are stuck on brand names, but with the economic status of our country...a good many are starting to re-think things.	1
	hyundai doesn't have to change, it's already a contender.	1
	you have obviously chosen the right screen name because you're so blind you can't see it.	1
	one thing i've learned in life...never say never.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3685#msg3685re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [allmet33]        if hyundai was forced to sell the genesis at the same price as the azera it would be a travesty and even more of an indicator that hyundai is having trouble selling higher priced cars and might be following gm/ford/chrysler's  path into the dumpster.	1
	this kind of thing not good for not only hyundai, but also  not good  for hyundai's 'acceptance' into the legions of the 'better' car mfgrs.	1
	as well as all those folks that have already invested in the thing.	1
	if you want to use vw as your example, then, let's not talk about a cheap car and an upmarket suv (notice that i don't call it a 'luxury' suv) , but a cheap car and a very expensive one that was a miserable failure.	1
	i don't really know what 'progressions' you are talking about, unless it is simply that they have shown the capacity to make a whole bunch of different types of vehicles.	1
	in next month's cr listing of their 'most reliable' cars, 40 out of 47 are 'japanese' and the only hyundai model to even make the list - the elantra.	1
	while no hyundai models appeared on the 'worst' list' either, the only progress i see from a reliability standpoint is that they aren't as bad as they once were - years ago - but still little to change that unfortunate  'disposable car' reputation.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3686#msg3686re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [captain2]         if hyundai was forced to sell the genesis at the same price as the azera it would be a travesty and even more of an indicator that hyundai is having trouble selling higher priced cars and might be following gm/ford/chrysler's path into the dumpster.	1

	as well as all those folks that have already invested in the thing.	1
	exactly!!!	1
	why not use vw...the rabbit was always known as cheap transportation, it just wasn't as disposable as an escort or excel.	1
	the point of your statement was that a company can't sell a cheap car and a car costing $40k, but lo  behold...not one, but two companies have and are doing it.	1
	the fact that hyundai isn't as bad as it used to be is the progress that needs to be seen.	1
	the fact that you don't see any of the models on the worst list is a huge statement...considering we are talking about hyundai.	1
	not to mention that hyundai/kia is the 5th ranked automaker in the world.	1
	anyway, back to the topic at hand...the debate should just stop at the fact that you and others seemingly have a problem with a $40k hyundai.	1
	it's as simple as that.	1
	it's not about what it should be or what it isn't or what some think it pretends to be.	1
	it's the fact that hyundai has a $40k car.	1
	get over it, if you don't like it...then don't get one, but don't sit there and say that this can't happen or that shouldn't happen...bottom line, it's happening!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3687#msg3687re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [captain2]        captain,                                i think you should stop now... its no point                                i think allmet works for genesis... else i adore his passion.	1
	there can be nothing wrong with genesis... even after seeing a banged up genesis in which airbags did not deploy he has this to say (post no 3633 above)                                 we know what the article says, but we don't know if the details are correct.	1
	for all we know, the photographer just walked up and saw the genesis coupe all crashed up and went from there, he/she may have never spoken to the actual driver to know if he/she was an owner or someone test driving for the company or what.	1
	for those who understand no explanation is needed                for those who dont understand no explanation is possible       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3688#msg3688re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [sanjaysdca]        no sanjaysdca...i don't work for hyundai, nor do i own a genesis.	1
	i am an azera owner.	1
	at no point have i ever said the genesis was the perfect car or that there was nothing wrong with it.	1
	come on now...if you're gonna call me out...get it right!	1
	so what...a picture was posted of one genesis coupe banged up against a light pole and the air bags didn't deploy...what is that supposed to mean?	1
	trust me, i've seen a few accidents in the dc area where cars have run into the backs of other cars and you don't see an air bag deployed and yet...the front end is pushed back significantly.	1
	if someone snapped a picture of you drunk out of your mind, passed out with vomit all around you...are we to assume you're an alcoholic?	1
	could have been a one time situation that you simply had too much to drink.	1
	the point is...why feed into it when it's a limited instance.	1
	now if we start seeing pictures popping up all the time with this problem...i think more heed should be paid, yes?	1
	the genesis isn't the perfect car, but it's the perfect car for hyundai in that it's the feather in their cap that can bring them a level of respectability they have yet to enjoy.	1
	no, it won't happen overnight because the genesis still has to prove that it is worthy of the accolades that are potentially waiting for it.	1
	hey, it's even possible that the genesis doesn't live up to it's potential.	1
	bottom line is hyundai has created a car that a great many didn't think it could and that in itself speaks volumes for the company.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3689#msg3689re: what to buy, when.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3690#msg3690re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [allmet33]         you and others seemingly have a problem with a $40k hyundai                right on - and apparently there are many many more just like us - betcha the profit on those 1000 cars/mo.	1
	they are selling can't even cover all those silly tv ads they are running during football games etc.	1
	granted it is a toyota and the economic times were much different but the avalon was running 10 times that volume a few months after it became available in 05 with no advertising at all, and it is not nearly the screaming 'deal' that the genesis is.	1
	you 'h' guys seem to be celebrating that hyundai is no longer amongst the dregs of the auto industry, which it seemingly has graduated from in recent years - perhaps just perhaps hyundai's should have loftier goals if it really wants to sell like the genesis to those badge and quality oriented folks that they seem to think would be interested.	1
	being 'average' is nothing to brag on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3691#msg3691re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [allmet33]         why not use vw...the rabbit was always known as cheap transportation, it just wasn't as disposable as an escort or excel.	1
	the point of your statement was that a company can't sell a cheap car and a car costing $40k, but lo  behold...not one, but two companies have and are doing it.	1
	the vws of today are very different from those of, say, 30 years ago.	1
	vws in the late '70s were known for low price, cheap interiors, poor rust resistance and many quality problems.	1
	the one bright spot was acceleration--the rabbit was a bit quicker than most of its direct competitors.	1
	today, vw is known as a sort of euro-chic brand with a distinctive personality, and people routinely pay more for vws than for comparably sized and equipped hondas, toyotas, or nissans.	1
	twenty years ago, hyundai was building very disposable cars.	1
	the excel was dreadful, and the first sonatas were equally so.	1
	the scoupe (remember?)	1
	was cute, but poorly executed.	1
	even ten years ago, not many buyers took the accent or the first elantra all that seriously.	1
	but now the mainstream motoring press regards the elantra and sonata as fully competitive with toyota, honda, and nissan--arguably superior in some areas.	1
	even the accent is a quality car                 for the money.	1
	it's just an image problem--but when you're buying a luxury car, image is very important, arguably more important than reality.	1
	with intelligent marketing, it won't be long before hyundai is taken as seriously in the azera and genesis price ranges as it is in the compact and midsize market.	1
	but i suspect the marketing is the weak spot.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3692#msg3692re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [captain2]         if you think about it there are very very few manufacturers that can successfully sell a $40k car alongside a $10k one.	1
	several manufacturer lineups include a $30k or larger spread.	1
	chevy does (aveo to corvette/suburban), toyota goes from corolla to land cruiser (actually a $50k spread), etc.	1
	i doubt you'll find many people who dis the 'vette because the same dealer sells aveos and cobalts.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3693#msg3693re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [fushigi]        come on, it's hyundai bashing time!	1
	join the party!	1
	really, though.	1
	when the same posters continue to post negative ideas and negative speculation, it becomes very obvious.	1
	people who are interested in reading about the genesis are not mindless lemmings.	1
	i guarantee you the majority are car enthusiasts who will read back through hundreds of posts if they haven't seen them already.	1
	bottom line:  the genesis is an exceptional car that compares very well with the lexus gs, and more and more people are showing interest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3694#msg3694the big unknown        the big risk with the genesis is resale value, assuming one likes the car and is prepared to pony up the $$$ hyundai is now asking for it.	1
	i've heard all the estimates and projections about residual values on the genesis, and they remain just that - projections and estimates.	1
	only time will tell if the early adopters are punished excessively or not for buying the first 30k+ hyundai.	1
	we passed on it because of the suspension issues we highlighted before, and which many articles and reviews are starting to mention, but that's just a subjective complaint.	1
	aside from the price tag and suspension, it seems fairly competitive with other cars in the same price range (even though many of those cars are now being sold with larger incentives given the economic morass).	1
	don       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3695#msg3695re: the big unknown [ksmigel]        that is very true.	1
	i bet a lot of people would like to buy the car, but are worried about what it will be worth in a few years.	1
	i know this is pretty terrible, but i hope it's low so i can pick one up in a couple of years cheap.	1

	...                                that goes for any manufacturer.	1
	when the '05 rl came out, a lot of folks jumped on it with it's $50k+ price tag; some folks even paid as much as a $5k markup!	1
	that's how enthusiastic they were about it.	1
	about a year later, a person could buy a brand new, loaded up rl for around $41k if they searched hard enough.	1
	the resale on them is horrendous considering honda products are supposed to retain value like a one-of-a-kind antique.	1
	anybody who buys an rl gets oiled up in depreciation off the bat, and those early adopters were absolutely slathered in it.	1
	but at the end of the day, they all still love their rls; low resale value and all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3697#msg3697re: the big unknown [ksmigel]        actually, the genesis was the                 third                $30k+ hyundai, following the azera and veracruz.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3698#msg3698re: the big unknown [backy]        while it is easy (and probably valid) to point to the economy and gas prices slowing genesis sales, both the $30k azera and $35k+ veracruz have not set the world on fire either saleswise, despite availabilty that dates back to 06.. the fact that hyundai builds some cars with higher pricetags does not mean that the consumers are ready to accept them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3699#msg3699re: hyundai working on eight-speed transmission for genesis sedan [captain2]        seriously...if you have a problem, the easy solution is...just don't buy one!!!	1
	before toyota dropped the avalon on us, they had established themselves as a dependable car maker.	1
	hyundai has improved greatly and nobody wants to give them the respect that's due them.	1
	all you want to keep saying is, 'but it's a hyundai!'	1
	you are right, for hyundai to no longer be among the dregs of the auto society is to be celebrated...considering they were one time the door mat and butt of all auto jokes.	1
	who says that hyundai doesn't have loftier goals?	1
	are you in their front office making decisions?	1
	just because you and a few other believe it should be one way, that doesn't mean it must be that way.	1
	like i've said and i'll say it again, hyundai is breaking the mold of what an automaker is supposed to be.	1
	i truly love the fact that it ruffles the feather of the likes of you and anyone else that can't get over the fact that hyundai is doing what they are doing.	1
	hyundai is far from average which is why they are now ranked #5 among all automakers.	1
	sorry charlie, you don't get that high being average.        	1

	i know what this is all about.	1
	it has nothing to do with hyundai being better than they ever have been.	1
	this isn't about leaps forward in regards to their dependability/reliability.	1
	this isn't even about hyundai producing vehicles that are more appealing to the masses (gotta admit they haven't always made sharp lookin vehicles).	1
	this is merely about the fact that hyundai has created vehicles that breach the magical $30k mark and it's killing you!	1
	that magical threshold is only supposed to be reserved for the likes of your precious toyota, nissan  honda, but not hyundai!	1
	dude...get over yourself and just accept the fact that it has happened and there's nothing you can do about it.	1
	instead of complaining about it and tryin to make an arguement from every possible angle as to why it shouldn't be, just accept that it is.	1
	the most you can do, is just not buy a hyundai that costs upwards of $30k.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3702#msg3702re: what to buy, when.	1
	[richard124]        agreed.	1
	with the currency movement and a huge glut of supply building in the us auto sector -- particularly the high end -- there is precisely no chance of hyundai making a price increase stick.	1
	the genesis will routinely be selling below current invoice within the first quarter of next year.	1
	no knock on the car, this is simply the reality of the short-term economic outlook.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3703#msg3703re: what to buy, when.	1
	[skylab]        to be honest, it sounded more like a desperate salesperson trying to create a panic so that folks would come rushing in to get one before the end of the year.	1
	even with gas prices falling, there's never been a trend where the price of the car has gone up...especially with hyundai!	1
	if anything, you may just see a $2k slip in prices.	1
	i forsee the v-8 w/tech package selling for below $40k to be honest.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3708#msg3708re: what to buy, when.	1
	[allmet33]        hi guys.	1
	the price increase may not be all fluff.	1
	i was told, before the genesis hit the ground, the there was a price hike in the pipe.	1
	as for the $2k, i can't speak to the amount, just that i was told that it was coming in some variety.	1
	shouldn't be that much of a shocker though.	1
	most cars get a price hike after they have been on the ground for a while.	1
	where do you think the money for the rebates comes from?	1
	i remember when a gls v6 santa fe stickered for $19k.	1
	now they are $23k, but lo and behold, there is a $2500 rebate, and $1000 side dealer cash!!	1
	same price, you just have to give out the 'deal' to keep sales going.	1
	as to resale value, i think that a number of people are missing a big factor here.	1
	this isn't about what percentage value the car holds, it's about the amount that it cost you to drive!!	1
	if a ls 460 is say, $70,000 new, i would say that one should look at the value 5 years out.	1
	my black book says that a 2003 ls 430 is worth around $15000-$16000 trade-in (real money, not 'allowance'), now that looks like $54000-$55000 to drive for 5 years.	1
	even if you went over book, and went to $20k, it still cost $50k to drive for 5 years.	1
	my point is that the genesis will have a positive value of some amount in 5 years, and with that in mind, you can drive for less than $40k (or $30k, whatever)in that 5 years.	1
	seems like that makes the depreciation amount less on the genesis than one of the most highly regarded vehicles on the road.	1
	just because an accent is $15k and is worth $3k in five years does not mean that you lost more money on it than you would, say an accord or a camry, or a corolla (insert your car where you like).	1
	the percentages look terrible on the cheaper cars due to each dollar being worth more, but folks, i can buy bread with dollars, not percentage signs!!!	1
	as to the comment about people looking for a 'quality' car not looking at hyundai, i ask, 'huh?'.	1
	people should seriously get in the auto that hyundai is now putting out.	1
	most every offering is on par with, or better than the equivalent offerings from toyota and honda.	1
	find me something about the genesis that is not up to the japenese offerings.	1
	also, take a look at the veracruz and tell me why this unit is 'beneath' a toyota.	1
	when you read the reviews of that vehicle, most all have been nothing but glowing.	1
	now, i agree that sales are awful, but that does not change the fact that the vehicles themselves are solid.	1
	lets go start another thread where we make baseless accusations about honda or toyota or nissan and see how much fun that will be.	1
	by the way nissan is just a new name for datsun.	1
	remember all of those awe inspiring datsun's?	1
	man, that must mean that nissan's are all garbage, right?	1
	please.	1
	one last thing.	1
	there are dealers taking m-b, lexus, and bmw cars in on this unit.	1
	hate to burst bubbles around here, but there are rumors of people buying these high end cars just to say that they have one.	1
	some of those people are realizing that when they get one, (wait for it) it's still a car!!	1
	it's not god's chariot.	1
	i have personally taken audi, bmw, and lexus models in on trade at my store for hyundai's not named genesis, so why would a top shelf model that is winning several journalist awards not get legit consideration from the top end clients?	1
	by the way i had a m-b in here last week trying to trade for a veracruz.	1
	$14k in the tub.	1
	hard to work with that these days.	1
	also, our first genesis sale was to a previous e-class owner.	1

	mostly they went out the door , and are still going out the door as 2008's with a                $ 4000  rebate for $ 62,000.00 .	1
	they are selling at the 'sales' for $ 50 k and less ( high 40's $ ) , with 2000 miles .	1
	yes ... that's is what i said .... the cars dropped invalue $ 12,000 $ with 2000 miles                in months .	1
	there is or could be a # of reasons for this that are external to the vehicle itself , but , and that is a big butt , the genisis is beating the lexus to smitherines .	1
	finally , the make pretend aristocrats at lexus are getting their hairs trimmed .	1
	i love my genisis .	1
	i love the looks , the feel , the double pane                glass / quietness, the 485 watt radio and xm satellite , the leather feel and touch , the nav system works on the fly ,                the trunk is huge compared to the ls mini trunk , the hid xenon's are absolutely awesome ( yes , they do turn with the vehicle ) , the ketless entry and starter button works , it runs on regular gas ( really ) , i put in $ 17 , for 10 gallons , and haverage over 25 mpg on the xway .	1
	i could go on and on ....                bottom line on this post : don't think about depreciation .	1
	depreciation on automobiles is directly related to the list price .	1
	therefore the amount of dollar cost in depreciation is a ton lower on the genisis , than the lexus .	1
	that is why hyundai is leasing them cheap for 27 months .	1
	( because when they come home in 27 months they will sell them and make money again )                ( especially with the large price increases on the genisis in the works ) .	1

	[jeffreid]        hey jeff.	1
	thanks for the thoughtful post and dealer perspective.	1
	i agree with most of your points regarding the future prospects for the genesis as a model and, possibly, brand.	1
	i'm also perfectly willing to believe that hyundai really has planned for a price increase following the initial introduction period.	1
	i just do not think that they will be able to follow through with it, given the state of the market.	1
	we'll see, right?	1
	purely anecdotally, my wife -- who is brand-insensitive but extremely quality-conscious -- much preferred the v6 genesis over the e class after test driving both.	1
	i think the 535i would still be at the top of her list because of that blistering twin turbo, but i wonder if a spin in a v8 might change things?	1
	if prices go the way i think they will next year and if (big if) we still have any money after the hard landing, i'll probably lease her a v8 and sit out the resale lottery.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3717#msg3717re: headlights standard [dborth]        dborth is correct, there will not be a v8 in the coupe.	1
	as for a release date, there is nothing firm yet.	1
	i have heard spring and summer.	1
	now that means may-september usually.	1
	but who knows.	1
	if rumors mean anything, then there could be a turbo v6 down the line, or maybe a di version to increase power for the coupe.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3723#msg3723update after 8,500 miles        as i roll up the miles, i find myself thinking that i was too negative in some of my previous posts.	1
	after taking a long trip, i am really pleased with the genesis as a highway cruiser.	1
	it gets you there in style and comfort without being boring.	1
	yes, i still stick with my previous posts that the ride can be jiggly and too firm over rough pavement, but the offset is that it handles most roads with supreme poise.	1
	this is the absolute best six cylinder that i have ever driven.	1
	i am convinced that the perfectly mated six-speed transmission has a great deal to do with its performance.	1
	i still moan about the speedometer reading 5% faster than you are actually traveling but i guess most of you are tired of hearing me repeat such a nitpicking complaint.	1
	i have a more serious problem to report.	1
	two times, i have arrived from a trip to discover that my battery was completely dead with the car parked in an airport garage.	1
	the first time, the hyundai technician got a readout from the computer indicating a defective battery.	1
	luckily, they had just unloaded another new genesis and they replaced my battery with the one from the new vehicle.	1
	yesterday, i arrived at the same airport after a four-day trip to experience the exact same dead battery scenario.	1
	when i got a jump-start from the airport police, the first thing i did was to check every electrical device and switch to make sure that i did not leave anything on.	1
	this time, the technician's computer did not indicate a defective battery.	1
	they wanted to give me a loaner car and keep my genesis for several days to see if they can duplicate the problem but i am leaving on another 2,000 mile trip in two days.	1
	therefore, we have decided that i will complete that trip and then leave it with them to research the problem.	1
	both the dealer and i think that there must be an electrical short.	1
	now for a gas mileage story.	1
	i filled the tank with pure gas (no ethanol), reset the computer, and drove from greenville, sc to stafford, va on i-85 and i-95 traveling most of the time at 80 mph.	1
	it was a beautiful day with no wind.	1
	i was elated that the car's computer indicated that i averaged 30.3 mpg.	1
	two days later, i filled up with gas containing 10% ethanol, reset the computer, and traveled back to greenville on another beautiful, no-wind day.	1
	there are no significant hills on this route and there was no difference in driving conditions.	1
	i only achieved 27.1 mpg with the ethanol blend.	1
	stay away from ethanol blended fuel if you have a choice!	1
	since i probably have put more miles on my genesis than almost anybody, i am trying in each of my posts to give a completely honest and objective assessment.	1
	i know that i hate reading some of the blogs that are based more on emotion than on actual facts and results.	1
	in spite of my complaints, and i have reported some, i still think this is one heck of a car!	1
	i'll like it even better if they can figure out my battery drain problem.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3724#msg3724battery drainage        the azera also reportedly had some battery drainage problems.	1
	i, myself, suffered a dead battery from sitting the car for more than two days.	1
	i think there is something pulling power from the batteries when not in use.	1
	sit it for a few days, and it's drained.	1
	all it needs is a recharge, but it's inconvenient.	1

	i live in the upstate area and drive an 07 azera.	1
	based on my experiences with my azera and the reports in cd and automobile re: the genesis suspension, i am a little cautious about getting a genesis right now.	1
	am still impressed with the car overall, but waiting a bit longer.	1
	also, i think they need to add more 4.6 features to the 3.8, maybe as another package above premium.	1

	on another track, wonder what would happen if hyundai purchased chrysler, kept jeep, downsized dodge to trucks only and changed genesis to chrysler imperial or just imperial and maybe azera as a new yorker?	1

	putting old chrysler names on its cars like the genesis and azera would be a giant step backwards, imo.	1
	i think hyundai can find better use for its money than to try to salvage chrysler.	1
	besides, genesis is a lot cooler name than imperial or new yorker.	1
	those names conjure up a 70-year-old retired man or woman cruising over to the doctor's office or mall.	1

	in my experience and those who i have talked to, the suspension isn't really that much of an issue.	1
	yes, the suspension isn't going to challenge a bmw, for example, but for the purpose of a luxury car, the genesis offers an extremely comfortable ride - around the town, on the highway, and through the back roads (aka everyday driving).	1
	compare to a bmw, the genesis will feel softer, less firm and controlled but that just makes the genesis having different driving dynamics, not inferior.	1
	is the genesis perfect?	1
	far from it (same goes for pretty much every single vehicle out there).	1
	there are room for improvements, no doubt, but considering this is hyundai's first effort in a true luxury car in north america, and taking into account the product and the goods the car offers, hyundai has every right to be proud of its product and the genesis deserves the praises from the industry to the consumers.	1

	given the companys short historythe korean industrial conglomerate didnt even have an automotive division until 1967its an amazing achievement.	1

	[joe97]        ahhhhhh...so right you are.	1

	this is basically the same thing that happened when the '02 sonata  the '06 azera dropped.	1
	it took almost a year before you started seeing them on the road with any type of regularity.	1
	i honestly believe the coupe will fare better simply because of the aftermarket push it will have already generated as hyundai has released pre-production models to some aftermarket shops to create bolt on parts for it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3761#msg3761re: car  driver on the genesis [backy]        you know backy...i'm starting to believe that the reason some folks are so hard on the suspension of the genesis is that they want it to be something more than it really is.	1
	it's not enough that it offers a ride equal to that of a lexus, infiniti or mb for a lot less, but there are those that are convinced that it must be equal to that of the bmw in handling as well to be taken seriously.	1
	in all honesty, when the genesis is driven in the manner it was designed to be driven (as a luxo-cruiser)...there are really no issues with the suspension.	1
	when the car is pushed and driven as one would drive a bmw...that is when the problems show up.	1
	as you said, it's not a bmw and if you want a car to handle like one...go buy one.	1
	on the flip side of all this, i will admit...it is hard to not want to push the genesis when you're in the driver's seat.	1
	it doesn't have that snap-your-head-back acceleration you would get with a bmw, but i guarantee this much...mash the gas pedal down and before you know it, you'll be saying 'whoa...i didn't realize...'  it's a very smooth accelerating car and when you realize how easily it can achieve speeds in excess of 75 mph, it makes you wanna drive it in such a manner.	1
	to the fault of hyundai, they should have made the genesis look more stately and less athletic (sorta like how the kia amanti looks...nobody expects it to offer any sort of performance style handling), maybe then folks wouldn't expect a luxo-cruiser to carve up twisting winding roads like a sport sedan.	1
	hyundai may be able to emulate quite a bit in terms of luxury, but it's not going to get everything right.	1
	to be quite honest, for the money hyundai is asking for the genesis (in any trim level), they got more than plenty right.       	1

	i recognize some people won't be satisfied with that, but there are other cars for them.	1

	some may want a cushy ride at the expense of ultimate handling while others care less about the ride but want great handling ability.	1
	upscale car makers try to find a balance that they hope will appeal to the greatest number of actual, prospective, car buyers.	1

	the genesis isn't a bmw but why should it be?	1
	the lexus doesn't aim for the handling levels of the bmw and it sells just fine, thank you.	1
	i have a 3 series bmw, and one of the things that i notice when people ride with me is how disappointed they are in the ride comfort and the luxury level of the interior.	1
	it doesn't match their expectations of a 'luxury car'.	1
	well, for me it's fine, because i like the driving experience, and i don't mind the 'rough' ride or the acceleration 'lurch' when i hit the gas.	1
	but those thinking 'luxury' are unimpressed.	1
	i think that genesis has made a wise choice to lean towards the lexus side of the equation.	1
	the handling is good, but not at the expense of prioritizing the luxury and comfort levels.	1
	for those (whom i think are) in the target market, the ability to slide around mountain bends is going to be an unused ability, but fast, quiet freeway cruising is an everyday requirement.	1
	i also think that a slow rollout is a wise decision.	1
	if the unexpected quality glitch happens at rollout (and they can happen to any company  ) it's a lot better to have a smaller number of cars out there.	1
	you can give better customer service while correcting it if you have 15,000 cars than if you have 50,000.  when starting a new line of cars, how you handle the problems that occur is a very important part of the introduction.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3772#msg3772re: car  driver on the genesis [allmet33]         ...                                    to the fault of hyundai, they should have made the genesis look more stately and less athletic...                                i think that's exactly what they did.	1
	the genesis [sedan] doesn't look 'athletic' at all, to me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3773#msg3773re: car  driver on the genesis [tayl0rd]        take for instance...the kia amanti and the hyundai azera...mechancially identicle vehicles and yet...less is expected from the amanti in terms of handling as opposed to the azera.	1
	the azera is a more athletic looking car, coupled with the decent power it has, it would seem to be a car that should be 'driven'.	1
	the amanti looks like nothing more than a car you would either cruise around town in.	1
	the genesis takes cues from the infiniti m and the lexus ls in terms of looks and folks are expecting it to 'run' like it looks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3774#msg3774re: in case you missed it and wanna see [allmet33]        thanks.	1
	didn't look to be getting too sloppy while those guys were slinging it through the corners on the track.	1
	as previously noted, the fact that hyundai went with a modern suspension design probably means that allaying the initial concerns in that area will be just a matter of getting the tuning right for the market.	1
	it's not like they cheaped out with a solid rear axle or something and are now stuck with it for this generation.	1
	other than that, the video just reinforced my impression that it's a good-looking car in motion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3775#msg3775re: hyundai does not want to hear from consumers or anybody.	1
	[chuck1]         why do you feel motivated to contact the manufacturers?	1
	i guess if you are passionate about the car then if car or the dealer lets you down that gives you a motivation to contact the manufacturer.	1
	we had two infinitis..in sept i replaced one infiniti with a acura and sent a letter to infiniti why i did not replace infiniti with another one...                                guess what got two phone calls, nice friendly conversation, and some coupons for servicing the one infiniti that i have.	1
	i had an extremely bad experience at hyundai... where the salesman at kerney mesa hyundai told me that 'genesis probably is too rich for you'...wrote a letter to hyundai customer service... two months and still waiting for response...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3776#msg3776re: car  driver on the genesis [backy]        funny you did not cite the longer, follow-up real road test where they had very serious concerns about the suspension and possibly the transmission/computer.	1

	i saw the replay last night.	1
	it was a genesis sedan, dang i got my hopes up on the coupe - i was misled                                anyway, the silver genesis sedan looked good nonetheless.	1
	i believe it's the v8 genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3778#msg3778re: hyundai does not want to hear from consumers or anybody.	1
	[sanjaysdca]        precisely.	1
	as i said lexus and others have welcomed input from me and others.	1
	that is how any real corporation improves itself - by seeking and utilizing consumer input.	1
	both the hyundai santa fe and genesis are off my prospective lists now and probably won't return.	1
	would rather pay more for a lexus, acura or infiniti and purchase from a company that appreciates conusmers and has great dealer networks and customer service.	1
	glad to hear that toyota and gm are looking at genesis.	1
	means that in a couple of years their cars will be comparably equipped, better supported, more reliable and customers more appreciated than hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3779#msg3779re: car  driver on the genesis [carolinabob]        why are you so fixated on those two reviews?	1
	more specifically, that one point, out of the many other points the reviewers made.	1
	there are also tons of other reviews you can reference...                                if the suspension was indeed an issue, wouldn't more reviews point it out?	1
	wouldn't we hear from all of customers?	1
	and, if you were trying to advocate readers and shoppers as you put it, you'd know better to provide the positives and negatives.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3780#msg3780re: in case you missed it and wanna see [skylab]         thanks.	1
	didn't look to be getting too sloppy while those guys were slinging it through the corners on the track.	1
	in all fairness...the track is smooth, but even the testers mentioned that even though the suspension is bit softer than they would like, the genesis maintained a great deal of poise in corners.	1
	also, there wasn't any mention of unstable driving when they drove over the raised edge markers along the course either.	1
	i would think if it was truly and issue to be raised, it would have been brought up there.	1
	the genesis looked really good coming out of some of those corners.	1
	i think, for what the car really is...it's more than adequate and i believe in what the overall genesis experience offers, it more than makes up for any suspension imperfections that may come up when the car is pushed hard.	1
	however, that's just my opinion.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3781#msg3781re: car  driver on the genesis [carolinabob]         funny you did not cite the longer, follow-up real road test where they had very serious concerns about the suspension and possibly the transmission/computer.	1
	october issue.	1
	actually i did--you didn't notice the 2nd set of quotes with the link to that review (republished on another web site) i guess.	1
	not sure what you mean by 'serious concerns about the transmission/computer' though.	1
	did you mean this?	1
	we also give high marks to the zf six-speed automatic for smooth operation, although there are a couple of demerits.	1
	it lacks the paddle shifters that are de rigueur for sports sedans today, and it will upshift on its own in sport mode.	1
	a bigger problem with the transmission in our test car was premature upshifting, well below the cars 6750-rpm redline, regardless of driver input.	1
	this held the genesis back in acceleration runs, where it took six seconds to reach 60 mph and clocked the quarter-mile in 14.5 seconds at 101 mph.	1
	our august preview test, conducted at hyundais proving grounds in korea, yielded 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds and the quarter in 14.1 at 103 mph.	1
	hyundai techs tried reflashing the transmissions computer but to no avail, so we put this down as a preproduction anomaly and expect showroom-ready cars to perform very much like our preview-test car.	1
	that was the only reference to a computer in the entire review.	1
	imo that is not a 'serious concern.'	1
	but if someone were looking for any possible reason not to like the car, i guess it could be.       	1

	[sanjaysdca]         ...                                    i had an extremely bad experience at hyundai... where the salesman at kerney mesa hyundai told me that 'genesis probably is too rich for you'...wrote a letter to hyundai customer service...                                and that's where you went wrong.	1
	the manufacturers don't control the dealerships.	1
	you should have written/called the general manager of the dealership to report your grievance.	1
	give that a try, and express that you had serious intentions of buying one of the vehicles.	1
	you'll be surprised how quickly the gm will apologize to you and try to get you back in to give them another try.	1
	in the background, the salesman you had issue with will more than likely be reprimanded and possibly fired if he's a poor performer.	1
	dealerships are in the business of making money, and they don't want salesmen on the floor who are chasing off potential customers.	1
	please try that route and see what happens.	1
	otherwise, give it a rest already!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3783#msg3783re: hyundai does not want to hear from consumers or anybody.	1
	[carolinabob]         precisely.	1
	as i said lexus and others have welcomed input from me and others.	1
	that is how any real corporation improves itself - by seeking and utilizing consumer input.	1
	lexus followed up with you on your purchase decision.	1
	that was very nice of them.	1
	on hyundai, you made suggestions about features, packaging, etc, automakers reserve the right not to share with the public its future products.	1
	sorry you didn't get the response you wanted but that's corporate policy pretty much across all industry.	1
	two different scenarios.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3784#msg3784re: update after 8,500 miles [carolinabob]        sorry for the late response ... i have been traveling.	1
	yes, i bought it in greenville (where i live).	1
	you mentioned that you would like to see more of the 4.6 features on the 3.8.  i happened to be at the dealer when they received a fully loaded 4.6 and it appeared to be identical to my 3.8 except for different styled wheels.	1
	my 3.8 is fully loaded with the tech pack.	1
	they let me drive the 4.6.  it was surprisingly similar around town, meaning that my first impression was that the performance advantage in local driving was very minimal.	1
	however, at 50mph or above if you really tromp on the accelerator, the 4.6 will overhaul the 3.8.  but i will emphasize again that i did not find much difference in 'normal' driving and i did not get out of the 4.6 thinking that i should have waited.	1
	i am not a poky driver either!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3785#msg3785re: update after 8,500 miles [colegar]        one thing i can tell you, the leather in the 4.6 is different than that in the 3.8. the leather has a finer grain to it.	1
	if you go to the website...you can see it for yourself.	1
	also, the 4.6 gets the wood grain/leather steering wheel, whereas the 3.8 only gets the leather wrapped one.	1
	lastly, the 4.6 gets the illuminated door sill scuff plates.	1
	other than that, most of the other options that can be found in the 4.6, can be had in the 3.8, but only if you get the tech package.	1
	as far as not feeling a difference between 290hp as opposed to 375 hp at lower speeds...sounds almost crazy.	1
	i would imagine the difference to be like me going from my '02 sonata (170 hp) to my azera (263 hp).	1
	even easing into the gas pedal, it was a clear difference.	1
	but then again, you are expressing your perception of the whole thing.	1
	personally, for the few thousand more the 4.6 costs...i would most likely go that route.	1
	i mean, to get all the bells and whistles that are offered, plus the 375 hp and not take a huge hit in the fe department...yeah, to me it would be worth it.	1
	however, it seems i'll have to wait on the coupe to come out as i can't convince the wife that letting my paid for azera go in the pot as trade for the genesis sedan.	1
	she would like a little running around car (a coupe if you will) and so that would be a fair trade off...i get my genesis and she gets her coupe!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3786#msg3786unpleasant buying experience from all dealerships        just wanted to rant a little about my buying experience... this is not a bash on hyundai per se, but 99.9% of all dealerships from all makes...                                i've been looking for the hyundai genesis for 3 weeks now in a specific color (blue ext.	1
	saddle int.).	1
	wayne hyundai (wayne, nj)                : i had a deal in place with that said they would try to find me the car... i signed a purchase order and gave them a $1000 deposit and they tapped my credit.	1
	1 week later they still can't find the car so i told them to try and get me the blk/saddle combo instead.	1
	in addition i asked them if i could cancel my deal if i were able to find it from another dealer and they agreed.	1
	2 more days go by and still no word from them.	1
	i have no idea what takes so long to find a specific color combo; you either have it or you don't.	1
	my guess is they couldn't find what i wanted and were waiting for me to break down and choose another color.	1
	so i called them yesterday and asked them to email a cancellation confirmation.	1
	of course i'm still waiting for this email...                                 nemet hyundai (bronx, ny)                : after hearing that i couldn't find the blue/saddle combo i saw on this dealers online inventory that they had one in stock.	1
	i called the dealership personally to ask if they had this color in stock and i was assured they did.	1
	so i took a one hour drive to see this car only to find out that it wasn't in yet!	1
	and that it was already sold anyway!!!	1
	hyundai city (burlington, nj)                : they had one in stock so i asked them if they could match the deal i had in place already.	1
	i told them the details of my original deal giving them the out the door figures.	1
	i asked them twice if they could match the                 out the door                figures and they agreed so i asked them to send me a quote via email.	1
	lo and behold, the email comes in and they match the price without including ttl!!!	1
	another day wasted....                                 suresky hyundai (goshen, ny)                : i finally just started cold calling dealerships and asking if they had the blue/saddle.	1
	this dealership stated that they could get this color in by the next day but it would have 200 miles on it because it would have to be driven in from the other dealership... at this point i'm willing to take the deal so they take my deposit over the phone and tap my credit (which i agreed to ) at 7:30pm last night.	1
	i hardly get a night's rest due to the excitement and when i don't hear anything from them by noon i decide to give them a call... turns out that the car is 'unavailable'!!!	1
	i have no idea what could happen overnight to make the car unavailable but they say that they've made a call into hyundai to ask for the next one that comes in.	1
	of course their word means s * * t to me now...                                so here i am without a car.	1
	my credits been tapped twice in two weeks and i have nothing but a handful of empty promises from these scumbags.	1
	if i go to another dealership my credit gets hit again... the only dealer who has been forthright with me is jeff reid who was kind enough to point me towards the few dealerships who do have my color.	1
	unfortunately his dealership is a thousand miles away...                                buying a car should be an exciting, happy, fun thing to do... i don't think i've been unreasonable; i've treated the dealerships with respect (undeserved though it may be).	1
	yet instead of those good feelings i feel like i've just run a mental marathon... but before you think this whole thing is only about hyundai let me tell you                 i've seen these exact same stunts pulled at honda, lexus, infiniti and bmw                when i was helping my parents get a car.	1
	the only difference is their s * * t came with a little more polish...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3787#msg3787re: unpleasant buying experience from all dealerships [bashogrebash]        the sad part about your experience is the misdirection the dealerships put you through.	1
	it's hard to find a specific color combo because they are not being shipped to the u.s. en masse quite yet.	1
	i had the same issue when i bought my azera in feb. '06.	1
	i was looking for black w/tan interior ultimate package and they simply didn't have any available.	1
	they had a silver one w/black interior and a blue w/tan interior, but i wanted black.	1
	so...i settled for the black w/tan interior premium package.	1
	the dealership i bought from didn't have it, they had to go to another dealer about 45 miles away, trade one they had in stock for it just to make the sale.	1
	you're right, it's not hyundai...it's the dealerships who are at fault here.	1
	sounds like they are making a bunch of empty promises and tap dancing to try and distract you long enough that maybe they'll find one for you.	1
	what's crazy is...why not try the honest approach and just tell you...'ummmm...sir, there are no genesis models with the color combo, trim level you're looking for at this time.	1
	we can keep your deposit and as soon as one becomes available...we'll notifiy you.'	1
	to tell someone you can deliver one in a day or two is crazy.	1
	to be honest, going into this process knowing the cars aren't being shipped in full force quite yet...you should have come expect difficulty in finding the exact color, trim, package combo you really want (unless you just get lucky).	1
	if this were a year down the road and the genesis were fully established in the u.s. and you were still having this problem, then it would truly be a huge issue.	1
	while it must be frustrating because you want what you want, try to keep it in mind that the supply of desired package isn't on par with the demand for them.	1
	i hate to say it, this is one the growing pains one must face when dealing with a brand new model.	1
	don't say it's a hyundai thing, saturn had this problem with the sky, pontiac with the solstice and they're stateside.	1
	audi has this issue with the a5...they actually have folks buying them without being able to test drive them in some cases because the dealer can't keep one on hand.	1
	p.s.	1
	getting your credit tapped twice in 2 weeks really isn't as bad as you think it is.	1
	if you were getting turned down, then it would raise a flag, but if you're being accepted...it's all good.	1
	the good thing is that it let's a dealer know you've been accepted somewhere else and they may try to make you a better offer if they can.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3788#msg3788re: unpleasant buying experience from all dealerships [allmet33]        i have no problem with a dealership telling me that they can't find what i want... but don't lie to me and tell me you can get it.... the last dealership actually lied about their ability to procure it and waited until they took my deposit to tell me they didn't have it!	1
	how crazy is that?!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3789#msg3789last post        this is my last post on any hyundai site.	1
	for those who have not experienced problems with your azeras or genesis', congratulations.	1
	however, it appears many will not admit to problems or just don't understand how a luxury car is supposed to perform - in all categories.	1
	some people will never admit they made a bad decision, but i am willing to admit it.	1
	btw, the reviews on edmunds are generally completed within a couple of months of purchasing the car; too early for problems to have surfaced.	1
	good luck with your cars, but i have given up on hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3790#msg3790re: unpleasant buying experience from all dealerships [bashogrebash]        yeah...that's the part that sucks.	1
	it's the underhandedness that some dealerships will stoop to just to make a dollar.	1
	i wouldn't be surprised if they even went so far as to tell you that your deposit is non-refundable too, just to keep you stuck.	1
	i'm really sorry you're going through all that.	1
	i would seriously contact the gm of the dealership and sit down with him and let him know what's going on and see what he's willing to do to make it right!!!	1

	however, to diss the genesis the way you have is unwarranted when you don't own one yourself.	1
	yes, you can definitely talk plenty about the issues you're having with your azera and rightfully so.	1
	i don't think it's so much a problem that many won't admit to the same problem you and others have because they may truly not be experiencing them.	1
	the problem may not be as widespread as you may feel it is.	1
	i personally know 5 or 6 other folks that own azeras in the later '06 to late '07 range that haven't had any issues at all.	1
	heck, one buddy had an '06 that got totalled in an accident and he went and replaced it with an '07 that had 16k miles on it and even he has said the ride is fine with no issues.	1
	not sure what the comment about how a luxury car is supposed to perform applies.	1
	the azera is entry level luxury at best and the genesis, well...it's already been proven to hold it's own against the likes of lexus and infiniti in terms of luxury feel with the materials used (save for the center console) and execution.	1
	the only aspect that's really been questioned is the suspension and i think the problem with it is folks are expecting it to be more than it really is.	1
	the genesis is not the luxury sport sedan many desire it to be or claim it's supposed to be.	1
	it's a luxury highway cruiser and in that mold, the car performs admirably under those conditions.	1
	sure, the genesis isn't perfect, but it's leaps and bounds ahead of anything else hyundai has produced which is truly a good thing for the company.	1
	take care and happy holidays to you and yours.	1

	with all due respect to you and the car salespeople that hang out on this board;  the car buying process is anything but happy and fun.	1
	exciting...well that depends.	1
	this is due to the adversarial process of buying a car.	1
	with the one dealer who took your deposit-they never had the car, they never knew if they could get the car, they took your money on the hope of being able to find your car.	1
	then they found out they couldn't.	1
	i have never bought a 'high end' car, so i can't speak on that end.	1
	however, i will tell you what you listed above would have been no different have you been trying to purchased a ford, gm car, honda, chrysler, toyota, etc., etc., or hyundai sonata.	1
	hyundai dealers and other listed above are not really interested in long term relationships.	1
	there is a 90% plus chance the sales person you buy a car from will not even be there the next time around.	1
	that's the way it is!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3795#msg3795bad experience with the genesis        i purchased a brand new hyundai genesis from hub hyundai in the west houston area last week.	1
	after only 4 days of 'enjoying' my new vehicle, it developed a couple of problems being the most serious one a rambling noise when starting to move from a complete stop.	1
	it progressively got worse to the point where i had to stop driving it and have it towed back to the dealership.	1
	after 2 days of testing, the dealer's service advisor tells me that it was a problem with the parking brake that it's housed with the regular brakes and claims it is fixed now.	1
	first it is unacceptable that a car with less than 300 miles on it has already experienced such serious defect.	1
	to add insult to injury, the dealer kept my car for 2 days, unable to diagnose the problem, and put 80 miles on it 'testing' it.	1
	that is just shear incompetence or fraud, by using my vehicle for other purposes without my knowledge or authorization.	1
	it is inconceivable that a $40,000 + new car may exhibit such low quality, and the dealership such poor judgment.	1
	what a far cry from the lexus dealership where i used to take my previous vehicle (lexus gs300).	1
	my advise to all of you thinking about buying a genesis with the misconception you are getting a luxury car: stay as far away as possible and save some more to buy a real luxury car.	1
	remember, you are paying more money for the whole package (real customer service) and in my opinion is well worth it.	1
	i'll never buy a hyundai again!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3796#msg3796re: bad experience with the genesis [regretful2]        do you seriously believe that every single vehicle that rolls off the assembly line is perfect?	1
	defects happen, no matter what the price of the car is.	1
	you're dealing with a mechanical product.	1
	unfortunately, you happened to pick the vehicle that had the defect.	1
	the key here is that it was taken care of and that you're back on the road.	1
	heck, i've seen a great many cars, high end cars with paper tags still on them on the side of the road.	1
	yeah, it sucks, but it's a part of life...especially when you're dealing with car ownership.	1
	crying about the dealership putting 80 miles on your car to test it and make sure it's been fixed...come on now.	1
	would you rather them call you and say it's fixed without any testing?	1
	yeah, i'm sure your hair would be on fire with that one!	1
	personally, with something like that...i'd be upset if i found out a repair like that wasn't road tested.	1
	i bet you would have been more upset if they didn't put the 80 miles on it testing it, gave you the keys  and as soon as you drove of...the problem popped up again...wouldn't you?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3797#msg3797re: bad experience with the genesis [regretful2]        i really feel for all you luxury owners who think that you will find the same level of service at a hyundai dealership as you do at a lexus dealership.	1
	come on guys-no disrespect intended to you or hyundai - but these are the same dealers who sell a $9,000.00 hyundai accent!	1
	i made an earlier post here about a friend of mine who had a porsche and he was met by a guy in a lab coat who took notes on everything he said when taking the car in for service.	1
	this same guy takes his wife's jeep in for service - complains about a high pitched noise that happens at a certain speed at the jeep service guys says to him 'are you kidding me?'	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3798#msg3798re: bad experience with the genesis [chuck1]        then there are those lexus dealers who sell, say, $8500 dodge caravans, like one of my local lexus dealers is advertising right now.	1
	that would be cool to take the caravan i purchased at lexus in for an oil change and be met with a guy in a lab coat.	1
	i'm sure i'd get a superior oil change there, because of the lab coat.	1
	over the years i've actually received the best service on my cars at places that looked like... dumps.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3799#msg3799re: bad experience with the genesis [chuck1]        no disrespect taken, i take my azera into a hyundai dealership and i'm met with a guy that works hard and respects good folk.	1
	he listens to every customer to find out what the problem is, takes their key and assures them it will be taken care of.	1
	i've even seen him pick up the phone to update a customer of any problems that arise (if there are any).	1
	if you choose to wait in the service area, he'll talk sports, politics, cars and various other topics with you to pass time.	1

	jd power recently released their 2008 initial quality study, which tracks owner experiences over the first 90 days with their new cars.	1
	as you can see, hyundai does quite well compared to a lot of other people selling generally far more expensive cars.	1
	doesn't mean                 your                hyundai won't have a problem, but does indicate that there's nothing much fundamentally wrong with their engineering or quality control.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3804#msg3804get a life         some of these comments seem to suggest that you should not be thinking that your genesis is up there with the more expensive cars that some of the posters must be driving.	1
	i think that to suggest that the genesis is as good makes them feel stupid for paying so much more for the 'name'.	1
	i can easily drive any car i want since my net worth is almost $3million and i did drive both a lexus and infiniti before but i think that the genesis is the equal of both of them.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3805#msg3805re: update after 8,500 miles [allmet33]        thanks for pointing out some of the differences (4.6 vs. 3.8).	1
	i only drove the 4.6 about four miles, half on freeway, half on city streets.	1
	i don't blame you for thinking it is strange that i was not blown away by the 4.6 because i had anticipated a huge difference.	1
	like i said before, that difference was mostly apparent when i really stomped on it, not in normal spirited driving.	1
	i have owned some serious performance cars and i do like power!	1
	in fact, i bugged the hyundai dealer for several months before any of the genesis arrived and promised to take the first black on black v8 that he received.	1
	however, my mercedes lease ran out in july and when he called me to drive the v6, i was pleasantly surprised enough that i decided not to wait several months for the v8.	1
	having said all this about how similar the two versions drive, i too would opt for the 4.6 for the $2,000 difference if i were buying another one today.	1
	not that i think it would be logical ... but who said that you should be logical when buying a luxury car???!	1
	i am on another trip right now and by sunday i will roll past 11,500 miles on the odometer.	1
	i assume that i have about as much seat time in a genesis as anyone (except for the korean version).	1
	i think it is a great car albeit with a couple of problems that i need them to get worked out (mainly battery drain problems).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3806#msg3806re: bad experience with the genesis [allmet33]        i can see now that some of the contributors to this post are actually hyundai employees whose daily living may depend on people buying their vehicles.	1
	it's okay allmet33, we won't hold it against you.	1
	driving my genesis for 80 miles to pin-point, diagnose and ensure the car was fixed only goes to show that the mechanics had no idea of what they were doing and that they were so big headed that they didn't even bother asking for help from the right people (i.e hyundai headquarters).	1
	again, it goes to show incompetence, ignorance and obvious disregard for the customer.	1
	i never experienced that from my lexus dealer.	1
	i know quite a bit about fixing cars and i can assure you that, with the proper knowledge and tools (computers these days), you do not need to drive a car those many miles to make sure it's fixed.	1
	in any event, i got corporate involved now and they seem to want to do the right thing.	1
	they are flying some expert mechanics (unlike the dealer ones) from california monday to take a look at my car and we'll go from there.	1
	stay tuned...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3807#msg3807bad experience with the genesis [regretful2]        let me give a disclaimer before i get accused of working for hyundai or a dealer-i am a service manager in a large dealership-it's not hyundai.	1
	my techs are required to check before they start repairs-this problem may have been hard to diagnose.	1
	they probably should have asked corporate for help instead of forcing you to do it-this is where they screwed up.	1
	cut the guys some slack-noises and driveability are two of the hardest things to nail down.	1
	the techs aren't allowed to just go in an change out parts because they 'think' they know what it is-if they order parts and install them they are required to hand a failed part back over to hundai.	1
	no failed part=the dealership and tech don't get paid.	1
	you can bet that once the tech is done-they are going to road test the vehicle to make sure all is well.	1
	this is where most dealerships get it wrong-they finish the vehicle and park it outside for you to pick up without doing a thorough test to make sure they got it all done.	1
	i have owned my 3.8l genesis since the middle of july and i haven't had a problem.	1
	i've also never seen a genesis on the road here in arizona besides mine since i bought it-i don't know where all of them are hiding.	1
	good luck-they will get your car fixed correctly.       	1

	i assure you, i am not a hyundai employee...if i was, i would have that new genesis with no problems.	1
	at best, i'm a hyundai fan having owned 3 hyundai vehicles (with the azera being my current one).	1
	i've experienced, first hand, the progression the automaker has made in terms of quality and dependability starting with their miserable start ('87 excel 4dr sedan), moving forward to their turning point ('02 sonata) and then now.	1
	hmmmmmmmmmmmm...you're right, you can hook up a computer to find out quite a bit about your vehicle, however...nothing can ever replace a good ol road test.	1
	sure, you can think a problem is fixed once you've put the tools down, but you never really know until you put the vehicle back on the road.	1
	at any rate, i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing the problems you are.	1
	i hope everything gets taken care of and you are motoring down the road with a smile on your face.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3816#msg3816re: battery and ethenol [richard124]        at least two reasons to add ethanol to gasoline.	1
	1) in areas that are 'non-attainment' zones by epa standards (such as north tx with non-attainment for ozone) the ethanol oxygenates the gasoline so it burns cleaner, thus less air pollution.	1
	all gasoline in n. tx included in the non-attainment zone must have ethanol.	1
	2) 'helps' meet the federal governments mandate of distilling and selling xx billions of gallon of ethanol by a certain year.	1
	to reduce dependence on foreign oil.	1
	problem with that is, ethanol takes more energy to distill a gallon than it takes to distill one gallon of gasoline, plus the btu value of ethanol is around 25%  gasoline.	1
	ask the rancher having to buy expensive corn to feed livestock what they think of the government mandate.	1

	folks pay the premium for the bmws because they want the best and couldn't really care much about any 'super promotion' it may or may not be available at.	1
	it is not price that sells the bmw (or many of the other cars you list).	1
	the hyundai buyer may never understand this....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3826#msg3826re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        perhaps you would care to explain then why bmw has for years massively subsidized leases in order to actually get their overpriced vehicles into customer hands?	1
	the truism has long been that only an idiot actually                 buys                a beemer and you certainly appear to fit the profile.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3827#msg3827re: us genesis november sales [skylab]        don't own one  - , if you think that anybody that spends the money on those bmws are 'idiots' then you would definitely be in the heart of the hyundai buying demographic                .       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3828#msg3828re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        'the hyundai buyer may never understand this....'                                gee, what an insulting comment.	1
	captain, your posts are really going downhill.	1
	you used to make a little sense.	1
	but you are so totally un-informed on bmw promotional pracrtices.	1
	now i'm beginning to wonder wonder why your fellow inmates elected you their captain.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3829#msg3829re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        bmw is discounting the interest if not the purchase price:                 http://www.edmunds.com/incentives/rebatecontroller?step=1#bmw        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3830#msg3830re: us genesis november sales [sandy25]        sandy25-                not meant to be insulting- but still a fact, imo, hyundais ever since they frist graced out shores have always been sold on the basis of price and continue to be.	1
	they are certainly discounted much more heavily than some of those other brands mentioned.	1
	the comment meant to mean that the hyundai buyer goes into the dealer expecting a cheap price (and a discount) more so than most other brands.	1
	the genesis it seems is no exception.	1
	as far as my fellow 'inmates' - now that would be one screwed up prison if i were their captain!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3831#msg3831re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        captain...you are right in that price isn't what sells bmw's, however...you make it seem like everyone going to buy one just walks in and pays msrp for one.	1
	so while performance may sell a bmw, a buyer is still looking for the best possible price.	1
	folks are still gonna pay a premium price to own a bmw and expect the premium experience.	1
	in the end, does it matter who is discounting what?	1
	sales are sales, right?	1
	after all, we are talking about how the genesis sales are stacking up against cars of the same class.	1
	last i looked...there were no deep discounts on the genesis.	1
	regardless of that fact...it's doing better than you anticipated based on your posts before the genesis was rolled out.	1
	why does everything from you always have to have a, 'yeah, but...' with it?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3832#msg3832re: us genesis november sales [sandy25]        have to back the captain up here...                                value buyers, which i think most, if not all, of the hyundai buyers/owners are may never understand why people pay the premium to go luxury.	1
	which is one of the major reasons that led me to believe that the genesis will not succeed while carrying a hyundai badge.	1
	well, if you think selling 1,100 units per month with heavy discounts then i rest my case...                                also, let's get this straight, in 'hyundai buyers may never understand why people pay premium for luxury' i do not mean that people who buy hyundai cannot afford luxury.	1
	two totally different statements so those of you who want to put words in my mouth, stop.	1
	i am sure the captain agrees with me on this one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3833#msg3833re: us genesis november sales [louiswei]         well, if you think selling 1,100 units per month with heavy discounts then i rest my case...                                where is the heavy discount?	1
	if you go to hyundai's website and check out the deals being offered by them, the genesis has none!!!	1
	so...any deals happening are through the dealerships.	1
	hyundai special offers                                and if you think bmw doesn't offer discounts...                                 passport bmw special offers                                oh yeah...i'm a value shopper myself, but i do understand the premium thing.	1
	i don't knock those that desire to go that route, to each their own.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3834#msg3834okay...i can't stop laughing!	1
	i just checked out one of the bmw specials on the link i provided...a 5-series that has a listed msrp of $46,325, being offered for $43,555 and you get...black leatherette!!!	1
	okay, okay...i'm sorry about that one.	1
	i just find that to be so hilarious.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3835#msg3835re: us genesis november sales [skylab]         the truism has long been that only an idiot actually buys a beemer and you certainly appear to fit the profile.	1
	sorry for the interruption, but as a bmw owner, i must point out that '                 beemer                ' denotes a bmw motorcycle.	1
	if you're referring to a bmw automobile, the correct term is '                 bimmer                '.	1
	you're quite welcome.	1
	incidentally, i visited a hyundai dealer a few weeks ago  looked at a genesis.	1
	while i didn't drive it - i'm not now in the market for a new car - i must say that i liked what i saw.	1
	the car looks better in the metal - more stylish  less generic - than it does in photographs,  it's certainly well put together.	1
	material  build quality are first-rate.	1
	i also had an interesting chat with a salesman, a courteous  competent chap, who said that he wished that the genesis was available with awd.	1
	in my relatively affluent  import-friendly zip code, most premium german  japanese car buyers choose awd when it's available.	1
	one rarely sees a bmw 3 or 5 series that isn't an xi, or a mercedes c, e or s class that isn't a 4-matic, even though our winters aren't all that severe.	1
	he was afraid that genesis sales would dry up as soon as the first snow flake fell.	1
	now i happen to believe that the benefits of awd are exaggerated (my bimmer has rwd), but if i wanted to buy a genesis, i'd be foolish not to take advantage of this salesman's fears  wait until right after the 1st winter storm to make my offer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3836#msg3836re: us genesis november sales [jimbres]         sorry for the interruption, but as a bmw owner, i must point out that 'beemer' denotes a bmw motorcycle.	1
	if you're referring to a bmw automobile, the correct term is 'bimmer'.	1
	sorry.	1
	i've never quite got used to that convention, which seems to be largely restricted to your side of the pond.	1
	and i have nothing against either bmws or their owners -- the dripping condescension of the post i responded to just sent me frothing over the top.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3837#msg3837re: us genesis november sales [jimbres]         i happen to believe that the benefits of awd are exaggerated                amen!	1
	but it is something that sells regardless of what real value it has.	1
	it has certainly become fashionable to have those 3 letters on your trunk lid.	1
	many awd vehicles  started life fwd  and are really fwd about 100% of the time - only reverting to rwd in slippery conditions and below certain speeds.	1
	in many parts of the country where really bad road condtions are infrequent (or non existent), i believe that we are better served saving the gas and some of that added mechanical complexity as well.	1
	if hyundai, in this case, decides to come out with an awd genesis, it's only because they are wanting to keep up with the joneses.       	1

	gosh captain...i can only wonder why that would be?	1
	maybe you don't intend for your posts to seem as such, but i have to point out (as others have seen as well), there are plenty of times you actually do come across like you're dumping on anything hyundai  this is not intended to start an argument or debate, just pointing out an observation to your pondering.	1
	can't we simply look at a manufacturer that has suddenly decided to spread its wings, has come out with several commendably competitve products recently ann then discuss why those products don't do as well as perhaps they should in the market place?	1
	did you're fingers cramp up while typing that?	1
	it actually would seem you threw a compliment in there.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3843#msg3843re: us genesis november sales [jimbres]        yes.	1
	transplanted, for my sins.	1
	and frankly, captain, the tenor of your posts reminds me of nothing so much as the snobbery and complacency that fatally undermined the british car industry in the face of patient, iterative design and engineering innovation by a far earlier wave of foreign (and hence, of course, inherently inferior) competition.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3844#msg3844re: us genesis november sales [skylab]        hmmm...now that has a familiar ring to it..just substitute u.s. for british..       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3845#msg3845topic        genesis, anyone?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3846#msg3846re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        i am assuming you're 'dumping' on the name hyundai, and not genesis, which just happened to be the best name in the segment, imo - the only car with a name...                                back on topic - so, let's forget the fact for a second financially hyundai has estimated the luxury nameplate would only break-even after some double digit years, who's to say the brand would be a guaranteed success, with zero brand equity?	1
	it took years and years for lexus to become established, for the most part; infiniti is still getting its bearings together (while most people still put down as infinity); and acura has not even come close to a household luxury brand despite the fact it was the first asian luxury nameplate in the us.	1
	even the germans, namely bmw and mercedes, having dominated this segment, has been seen as susceptible.	1
	regarding the decision, again, hyundai did what it felt was the best option for the us market.	1
	and we know the genesis under the hyundai umbrella has been resilient, if nothing else, despite the crisis being experienced in recent months.	1
	continued 'dumping' isn't going to do much so let's see how the genesis plays along.	1
	personally i feel the arrival of the genesis family (with the upcoming coupe) helps in three general areas:                                1) the products themselves, of course                2) other products within the fleet                3) increased perception of the brand/company                                as an aside, those who predicted the genesis would be doa like the phaeton - show yourself        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3847#msg3847re: us genesis november sales [joe97]         as an aside, those who predicted the genesis would be doa like the phaeton - show yourself                                you didn't just call them out did ya?	1
	there are a few enjoying a little bit of crow, but will hardly admit it.	1
	either that, or they'll try and take a new angle to explain why the genesis will be a failure.	1
	personally i feel the arrival of the genesis family (with the upcoming coupe) helps in three general areas:                                    1) the products themselves, of course                  2) other products within the fleet                  3) increased perception of the brand/company                                i agree completely with you here (another point the nay sayers debated vehemently).	1
	product awareness has indeed shot up with the amount of advertising that's been behind the genesis.	1
	when's the last time you've heard of any tv show being sponsored by any other hyundai vehicle?	1
	yeah, there was a show that debuted and all the ads leading up to it said, '...brought to you by the hyundai genesis.'	1
	no other car in the hyundai stable has enjoyed the amount of attention that the genesis has received...even before it was brought to market.	1
	as i said early on, folks would be interested to see what this car was about and it would also have them taking a look at the other cars that are offered.	1
	all of the other models definitely benefit indirectly.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3850#msg3850re: us genesis november sales [allmet33]        sales are usually measured by two criteria....volume and share-of-market.	1
	the wall street journal report on november auto sales shows hyundai to be one of the few companies showing an increase in share.	1
	that is a good thing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3851#msg3851look at me        adevertising for the genesis is certainly creating awareness.	1
	i just picked my v6 up last week and have already been stopped on three occassions by people excited to get a look at the car 'they saw on tv'.	1
	i have owned lots of 'luxury' cars and this has never happened before...and i kinda like it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3852#msg3852for those wondering...         if anyone trades a premium brand sedan in for a genesis...i pulled this from the review section for the genesis.	1
	you'll also notice a host of genesis owners that still have or previously had various vehicles from the premium brands as well.	1
	hyundai must be doing something right to pull those folks in.	1

	owned 7 series  was nice compromise, esp.	1
	price.	1
	hyundai's first foray with an all-new rwd platform  v8 engine in this class is impressive.	1
	my car turns heads and i love its understated execution.	1
	has the luxury amenities i need and $$$ to spare.	1
	wish it was sold in a dedicated channel -- i.e., genesis brand -- wouldn't mind stripping the h logo and replacing it with domestic market genesis wings logo (front, back, wheel hub  horn pad)                                    favorite features                                    easy to drive, smooth, quiet and refined.	1

	suggested improvements                                    wish that the brakes were more on par with vehicles in this class (see bmw b/mark).	1
	prefer a bit firmer handling  less body roll.	1
	would look dynamite with some nice wheels.	1
	agree that pass seat should be cooled as well.	1
	need much better dealer experience  more advertising!!	1
	brand needs enhancement                                 i just posted these few cases where folks have traded in a premium sedan for the genesis just to show it does indeed happen.	1
	mainly aimed at the nay sayers that just feel it simply couldn't happen.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3854#msg3854re: us genesis november sales [joe97]         those who predicted the genesis would be doa like the phaeton                give it a chance                the phaeton was not doa or even still born, actually a damn fine car being sold at the wrong place for the wrong price.	1
	it certainly didn't take long though for vw to discover that the world was just not ready for a $70k vw regardless of how good it was.	1
	imo, the genesis is a damn fine car being sold at the right price but also at the wrong place.	1
	as  much as a 'screaming deal' as it may be,  it has not been available anywhere near long enough to be sure that it will not suffer the same fate or even to declare it a success -from a business point of view.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3855#msg3855re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        funny though, those few months the genesis has been available have been more than enough for some in this discussion to deem the entire venture an utter failure.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3856#msg3856re: us genesis november sales [captain2]        'give it a chance'?	1
	you'd want the genesis to fail?	1
	anyway, check this out, the genesis has already sold more, a lot more, than the entire us run (roughly 5 years iirc) of phaetons in just a few months.	1
	in its best year (2004), vw sold 1,939 units in a whole year.	1
	while i'd agree the phaeton was a very good car, it never really had a chance, so yes, i'd contend it was doa.	1
	on another note, how can you say the genesis is marketed at the wrong place?       	1

	of course not, the genesis is unarguably a helluva lot of car for the money - although i think it and hyundai would do better with it with a  new brand name, a new group of genuine                 luxury                dealers etc.	1
	adding with the genesis things like the veracruz etc.	1
	the point of my post, was really that you 'h' guys seem ready to decare that the genesis as some sort of unmitigated success , but imo it is plainly too early to make such declarations - not at a paltry 1000 cars/mo.. it may be another year or two before we know whether the car buyer is ready for $40k hyundais.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3861#msg3861what is success?	1
	a company with no history, experience, or reputation for luxury cars (in the u.s. at least) launches an all-new luxury sedan at a time that is the worst time for selling cars, let alone luxury cars, in many years.	1
	yet that car outsells or at least sells about as many units as established models from brands that specialize in luxury cars.	1
	if that is not a success, i don't know what is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3862#msg3862re: what is success?	1
	[backy]        hmmmmmmm...that is a pretty good point there backy.	1
	on the flip side, i know captain will say that it's all well and fine that hyundai seems to have hit a home run in the top of the 1st inning, the question is...will they still be hitting a home run come the bottom of the 9th.	1
	the genesis has indeed been a great story for hyundai, much better than the sonata ever was and exactly  what they should have done for the azera.	1
	if...hyundai decides to listen to the people and fix the things that are considered misses in the car and do something about upgrading customer service...they'll definitely be in it for the long haul.	1
	i for one, am a believer that hyundai is indeed in it for the long run and only time will prove it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3863#msg3863re: what is success?	1
	[allmet33]        9th inning?	1
	you mean, as in how lexus is an utter failure with the gs because its sales are tanking?	1
	or how infiniti is an utter failure with the m because its sales are falling and they can't sell them w/o huge discounts?	1
	or more like the fact the genesis was not the perfect luxury car on hyundai's first attempt?	1
	if 'upgrading' customer service means adding leather couches and lab coats, and a silver-plated espresso machine, with commensurate increases in price of the genesis, i'd just as soon take the relatively utilitarian customer lounge at my neighborhood dealer while retaining its already high level of service.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3864#msg3864re: what is success?	1
	[backy]         or how infiniti is an utter failure with the m because its sales are falling and they can't sell them w/o huge discounts?	1
	playing devil's advocate...if we weren't in the recesssion we're in...would the sales of those cars be as bad as they are now?	1
	personally, i don't care if the sales of those cars are on the decline, the fact that sales of the genesis seem to be steady shows something.	1
	or more like the fact the genesis was not the perfect luxury car on hyundai's first attempt?	1
	as it has been pointed out...the ls wasn't a perfect luxury sedan on the first attempt.	1
	if 'upgrading' customer service means adding leather couches and lab coats...                                personally...i agree with you on this.	1
	i don't believe all of that is necessary to have upgraded service.	1
	it means more to me to have a service department that is attentive to your needs.	1
	one that doesn't act like you're a burden, but the reason why they are there to begin with.	1
	one that can provide you with a comfortable (not lavish) waiting area is fine by me.	1
	lab coats...what exactly does a lab coat mean?	1
	dr. frankenstein wore a lab coat.	1
	sorry...i'd rather talk to the guy whose hands are greasy  oil because he actually works on the cars.	1
	in the end, just don't make me feel like i wasted my time by bringing my car to you.	1

	exactly.	1
	ever been to a saturn dealership?	1
	even though the vehicles aren't that expensive and the surroundings are not luxurious, the experience is pleasant.	1
	why?	1
	because the environment is clean and comfortable, and the dealership personnel (sales, service, and administration) are trained to treat customers with respect.	1
	it doesn't cost much to provide that kind of service.	1
	but hyundai dealers (and honda dealers and toyota dealers and.	1
	.	1
	.)	1
	do not uniformly provide it.	1
	some do quite well--others exemplify the bad old days of the car business.	1
	it doesn't help matters that many hyundai dealerships got their start as adjuncts to used car businesses, and some still function that way.	1
	i believe that hyundai could adopt the saturn model of customer service and reach customers who might otherwise still be skeptical about the brand's quality.	1
	a separate certification program for those wishing to sell the genesis would be a start.	1
	and no, i don't work for saturn.	1
	or for hyundai, for that matter.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3866#msg3866re: what is success?	1
	[stephen987]        stephen987...it's not so much hyundai, it's the individual dealerships that have this problem.	1
	the hyundai service department i go to...is one that gets it.	1
	the problem is that all of them need to 'get it'.	1
	i also own a saturn and the service department at the dealer i go to offers quite a pleasant experience as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3867#msg3867re: what is success?	1
	[allmet33]        i agree.	1
	my point was that if hyundai could find a way to push its dealers in that direction, they'd probably see an improvement.	1
	it may not be possible within the structure of current franchise agreements, which i'm guessing are rather lax.	1
	on a not-entirely-unrelated note, two new hyundai dealerships have sprung up within 30 miles of here, competing with an established one in a somewhat impoverished area.	1
	one is owned and operated by a guy who's been operating a failing mitsubishi dealership here for a couple of years, and the other is an offshoot of a fairly large (if not very reputable) ford dealership.	1
	neither one appears to have invested much money in either inventory or facilities, and neither appears to offer much competition for the older store, a small but reasonably attractive facility with an iffy reputation.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3868#msg3868re: what is success?	1
	[stephen987]        you're absolutely right, hyundai would benefit from putting their hands in dealer affairs in terms of how those that are representing their company are treating the consumers that buy their products.	1
	heck, they might even see an increase in sales should customer service improve all around!	1
	i'm sure hyundai could find a way to 'punish' those dealers that don't live up to standards they could set and reward those that carry out or exceed those standards.	1
	however, i don't think it'll be something they would act on unless there was enough consumer complaint in that direction.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3869#msg3869re: what is success?	1
	[stephen987]        maybe hyundai could snap up saturn and use it to improve their overall dealer experience.	1
	word is that the division could be sold.	1
	and hyundai could add a 2-seat convertible to the genesis offerings.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3870#msg3870re: what is success?	1
	[backy]        hmmmmmmmmmmm...with the direction that saturn is going with the upcoming models that i've seen inked...whoa!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3871#msg3871re: what is success?	1
	[allmet33]        i don't know about that... the new opel mid-sized sedan looks like a nice piece, maybe for the next-gen azera (or a smaller genesis sedan)?	1
	the outlook is quite nice too, for a big suv, but hyundai already has the veracruz.	1
	but buying saturn would be more for the value of its dealer network and service model than the vehicles.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3872#msg3872re: what is success?	1
	[backy]        the outlook is indeed a nice vehicle (got one) we crossed shopped the veracruz.	1
	if the veracruz had offered captain's chairs in the 2nd row and more room behind the 3rd row seat...we would have had that instead.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3873#msg3873re: what is success?	1
	[backy]        i agree--the saturn dealer network would be a tremendous asset for hyundai.	1
	then again, some fusion of current hyundai and saturn dna would make for some very interesting cars indeed.       	1

	the genesis offers a host of luxury and convenience features, along with a full complement of safety equipment, including eight air bags and standard electronic stability control.	1
	the top versions of the genesis are powered by hyundai's first v8, a 4.6-liter, 32-valve engine that produces 375 horsepower.	1
	most genesis sedans will use the 3.8-liter v6.	1
	we bought a typically equipped v6 version.	1
	its total price came to $36,000.	1
	initial impression                                the genesis is a roomy, quiet car with a punchy, refined powertrain.	1
	though it handles soundly and rides well,                 it lacks the final polish that sets true luxury cars apart.	1
	the 290-hp v6 is torquey and refined.	1
	the engine comes mated to a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission.	1
	this powertrain provides plenty of get up and go, and it averaged a respectable 22 mpg overall.	1
	a heavily advertised v8 is available, but the v6 delivers enough performance and it's clearly the better value.	1
	handling is sound but not sporty.	1
	the steering is quick but slightly lacking in feedback.	1
	while the ride is quiet and generally well isolated, rough pavement can provoke sharp nervous pitches that are out of place in a car of this class.	1
	the vast cabin provides lots of room to stretch out, front and rear.	1
	the steering column rises and retracts automatically when the driver leavesa feature normally restricted to high-end cars.	1
	the controls are blessedly uncomplicated and straightforward.	1
	fit and finish are first class.	1
	cr's take                                the genesis is an impressive car for the price, even if it doesn't quite match the excitement or refinement of the far costlier, similarly sized bmw, infiniti, and mercedes-benz sedans.	1
	what you get is essentially the driving experience of a $50,000 to $60,000 car for a lot less than $40,000.	1
	read how it ranks among its peers and other alternatives in the february issue of consumer reports, and online in january 2009.       	1

	what stands out to me is they are not specifying a particular 'class.'	1
	is it expected to have a super-pillowy ride and grandpa-like handling since it's priced close to an es350?	1
	or, are they comparing it to a 5-series that has a better balance of ride and handling for $20,000 more?	1

	the battery seems to be dead, can you give me more insight on what was the real problem with the battery, as you went to the technicians.	1
	i don't have hyundai professionals around i want to know what could be the real problem ( factory defect) and what the solution is.	1
	if it is a problem from hyundai shouldn't they come up with a solution to everyone ?	1
	it's a shame to have that, i bought the car few months ago haven't had time to use it.	1

	am i blind and can't see something cr said, or is this your usual personal bent on the genesis?	1
	how do you interpret this simple sentence?	1
	'while the ride is quiet and generally well isolated, rough pavement can provoke sharp nervous pitches that are out of place in a car of this class.'	1

	'while the ride is quiet and generally well isolated, rough pavement can provoke sharp nervous pitches that are out of place in a car ((( of this class. )))'	1
	again, which particular 'class.'	1
	super soft with no handling ability like an es350, which costs about the same as a loaded genesis 3.8l?	1
	or a masterful, decades-in-development ride/handling balance like a bimmer 5-series, which costs $20,000 more?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3891#msg3891re: consumer reports remarks on genesis: good; suspension is not competitive [ksmigel]         how do you interpret this simple sentence?	1
	'while the ride is quiet and generally well isolated, rough pavement can provoke sharp nervous pitches that are out of place in a car of this class.'	1
	to me that says in general the suspension is sound but needs a little tweaking/tuning/adjustment to make it even better.	1
	it may even mean that in my driving environment, i might not ever experience their reported 'problem'.	1
	does it mean that the suspension is not competitive as you say?	1
	not by a long shot.	1
	in fact, cr's summary seems to indicate that they think this is a pretty darn good car!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3892#msg3892hyundai has a problem        honestly...the genesis is proving to be something more than what hyundai intended.	1
	i mean...the problem i see is that with the smooth power either power plant offers in that car, it makes you wanna really drive it.	1
	what i mean by that...hyundai created the genesis as a luxury highway cruiser, so it's no surprise the suspension is tuned as it is.	1
	however, with 290/375 hp on tap and a car that's pretty well balanced...once you're in the driver's seat, you can't help but want to push the car beyond it's luxury highway cruiser persona.	1
	because techinically speaking it can contend with the likes of bmw in terms of acceleration, there are plenty of folks that equate that with meaning it should also handle like one.	1
	if folks (those that expect more)  would simply look at the genesis for what it really is...i'm sure you will find the suspension to be more than adequate for daily driving.	1
	the funny thing is...if hyundai addressed the suspension and tuned it more like a bmw, i think there would be a lot of folks that would then slam hyundai for trying to create a cheap bmw.	1
	it's really a no win situation in the eyes of those people.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3893#msg3893re: consumer reports remarks on genesis: good; suspension is not competitive [tenpin288]        to me it means that drivers in sunbelt states will never notice anything wrong, while drivers in pothole-rich illinois and michigan will think the car's significantly underdamped.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3894#msg3894re: hyundai has a problem [allmet33]        maybe hyundai could address the needs of both kinds of buyers by offering a 'sport' package on the genesis, as is done by bmw et.	1

	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3897#msg3897i like it         again let me weigh in on this.	1
	i did trade in a luxury car (infiniti q45) and previous to that drove a lexus ls400.	1
	the genesis actually has more interior room then both and uses regular gasoline as well as getting more mileage.	1
	the ride is not as soft as either of the other two but that is probably on purpose so that you get a sportier driving experience.	1
	i actually prefer a softer ride.	1
	the only two things that genesis might improve on in the next generation would be to put bluetooth button on steering wheel to access car phone and soften the ride a bit.	1
	i have 3,000 miles on my 3.8 with the premium plus package that is all i wanted.	1
	you can buy a navigation system and backup camera for a fraction of what you pay by upgrading to the tech package.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3898#msg3898re: i like it [sheltonzz]        what did you mean when you said 'put the bluetooth button on the steering wheel to access car phone' in your review.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3899#msg3899re: i like it [mn778]        it is above in the middle of the overhead light console.	1
	to answer the phone you have to reach up and push the on button as well as signing off.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3901#msg3901re: update after 8,500 miles [anmouss86]        regarding dead batteries.	1
	this is not a problem limited to the genesis.	1
	many hyundai models have the battery drain issue -- including the azera i currently drive.	1
	the simple explanation is that there are some components (security system, etc) that are constantly running and draining the battery when parked.	1
	over the course of two to three days, it will drain the battery enough that the car won't start.	1
	the solution is to charge the battery again.	1
	i don't really know if this is a 'defect' or 'flaw'.	1
	since this occurs with several models, it appears to be a common issue.	1
	the only way to really address it is to identify the components which are drawing power when idle and to re-design those components to draw less power.	1
	i think all cars draw some power when parked.	1
	it's just a matter of degree.	1
	it appears that some hyundai models draw more power than others which leads to a faster drain cycle.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3902#msg3902re: update after 8,500 miles [anmouss86]        wow!	1
	this is concerning to know that this problem may be more than just an isolated 'fluke' on my vehicle.	1
	i saw another response to yuur post that discussed this problem of battery drain being experienced on hyundais other than the genesis.	1
	he said it probably is because of all the electronics (security system, etc.)	1
	that continue to draw power with everything turned off.	1
	i can't accept that as being a tolerable situation.	1
	all new luxury cars are loaded with electronics and they do not drain the battery dead in three or four days.	1
	relative to my previous post, i have not taken any trips that required me to park the genisis for more than a day and i don't have any trips planned until after the first of the year.	1
	"also, i have not had a chance to leave the car with the dealer for them to try to rel\plicate the problem."	1
	i will keep you posted.	1
	took a 2,000 mile trip for the thanksgiving weekend.	1
	the geneisis is a wonderful car for long trips.	1
	my fuel mileage was not as good as the trip that i discussed in the previous post but i was stuck with fuel containing 10% ethenol all but one tankful.	1
	on that tankful i got 28 mpg.	1
	the ethenol fuel, i only got slighty over 25 mpg.	1
	what a scam!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3903#msg3903re: hyundai has a problem [backy]        what hyundai says:  'genesis delivers precise steering and handling as it offers a quiet, refined and comfortable ride--two suspension goals that normally conflict.'	1
	and this: 'the rear features a precisely tuned geometry optimized to deliver incredible ride and handling.'	1
	and 'amplitude selective damping (asd) is one of the most advanced suspension control systems available today.'	1
	... 'what this means to the genesis driver is improved ride and driving comfort without sacrificing handling stability or control.'	1
	all quotes are from the glossy hyundai genesis sales brochure.	1

	notice it did                 not                say, 'the genesis provides great ride comfort under any normal road conditions.'	1
	how                precise?	1
	how                quiet?	1

	how                stable?	1
	as for 'incredible'--there are different ways to interpret that word, aren't there?	1
	however, there have been 3rd party affirmations of the design of the genesis' suspension being 'advanced', e.g.	1
	c/d (8/08) said of it:  'the suspension, as well, is as sophisticated as they come.'	1

	i'm assumming you mean that somehow hyundai is representing that the car is in some ways comparable to some higher dollar european cars?	1
	that can't be fraudulent because within the narrow definitions of those ludricrous ads what hyundai is saying is true - will it out accelerate a 528  yep and so will many many other cars, is it bigger than that same car by a substantial margin, so is a taurus etc.	1
	etc.	1
	however, is it really really an alternative to the 'machines' that those bmws are - not close  - depending on your definitions and expectations.	1
	as i think,                 kdshapiro                pointed out at one time - it is precisely that last $10 or $20k more you pay for a bmw and a long rich history and sophistication that makes it what it is                i do think though you point out a problem with hyundai's advertising campaigns relative to the genesis, they are attempting  make us believe that the car is something it plainly isn't (and honestly can't be).	1
	it is quite logical that the car be soft - as this is what sells to americans, and it is also quite logical that hyundai  is not going to be able to reproduce the refinement present in those german cars - first time out.	1
	some buyers will feel cheated when the car does not meet  the claims and others (like me perhaps) will simply dismiss it out of context not even having driven or owned the car.       	1

	[rlejr66]        the emblem is held on with a 3m adhesive pad.	1
	in order to prevent scratching the car surface, i used an old cd to work it under the emblem until it was free to pull off.	1
	i took off the trunk lid lining just to be sure there wasn't some other fastener, but you don't have to.	1
	the adhesive is tough.	1
	it does take some work to get all the old glue off before mounting the new emblem.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3924#msg3924re: genesis ipod cable availability?	1
	[genesis57]        as discussed in the azera forums when folks were debadging...another method is to heat the emblem up with a hair dryer/heat gun, then using some strong fishing line...work it under the emblem back and forth like flossing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3925#msg3925re: genesis is a finalist [ergsum]        i think the genesis has a real good chance against the flex and jetta tdi.	1
	the jetta tdi is a five-year-old design with an updated diesel powerplant.	1
	how it made it to the finals i have no idea.	1
	the flex breaks no new ground.	1
	in fact, it resurrects old ground that is better left unturned, imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3926#msg3926two words to consider...and a few other things        1.  caveat emptor - 'let the buyer beware' is guiding principle for consumers in most                free market transactions.	1
	since a car is often the second biggest purchase a                consumer will make, the exercise of caution is advisable.	1
	2. is it your contention that hyundai actively concealed latent defects when                engineering and manufacturing the genesis sedan?	1
	proving such a contention                will be far more difficult than simply making a forum claim, considering hyundai,                the worlds 5th largest automaker, employs thousands of engineers and spends                more of their profit on rd (nearly 9%) than any other manufacturer the world.	1
	i'm told chairman chung retains outstanding legal counsel.	1
	3. i have personally spent extended driving time in genesis pre-production models  as well as the production offering and can vouch for the competence of this very advanced suspension.	1
	from the aluminum construction to the advanced multi-link set-up, hyundai engineers debated long and hard on the ride/handling delivery equation that would showcase this suspension.	1
	engineers final decision leaned towards real world delivery of a balanced 'steady state and transitional' handling dynamic.	1
	it's hard to argue with real world data, versus subjective opinions of journalists who have claimed that the genesis suspension is 'unexceptional'.	1
	yet the genesis outperformed the bmw 550i  at .94 g .	1
	the 550 pulled a .90g.	1
	the claims that the genesis suspension is inferior,  'incompetent' compared to much more expensive cars,  or poorly engineered is not only unfounded but uninformed.	1
	anyone purchasing a first-generation genesis is receiving a platform that received nearly                 three-quarters of a billion dollars                in engineering and development.	1
	there have been numerous inferences by consumers and auto journalists that the genesis platform has similar dna with the azera and sonata models, but this couldn't be further from the truth.	1
	the genesis sedan and couple platforms are offerings that are a radical departure from the sonata, azera and tiburon dna and 10 minutes of seat-time in either genesis model will reveal this.	1
	most of the criticism of the genesis sedan is linked to issues that have nothing to do with the engineering and performance delivery of this platform, but focuses on brand cache` and aesthetics.	1
	and yet this is precisely how the luxury segment operates and hyundai has decided to enter the segment in a manner that leaves many wondering if they can pull it off.	1
	only time will tell but my prediction is that the genesis sedan and coupe will accomplish everything hyundai has intended and the benefits from the success of these platforms will be felt across the entire hyundai line-up.	1
	i am already surprised that the genesis is receiving numerous accolades internationally and outselling many of it's competitors.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3928#msg3928hyundai  brand name change        i think the worst enemy or obstacle when it comes to new genesis and other models is not the competition but the name hyundai.	1
	they should seriously consider change the name like nissan did if new upscale division is out of question due to a few reasons.	1
	with a new name,even thou almost all consumers know that it is still hyundai but                they will realize 'it is not the 80s hyundai anymore rather quality product.	1
	new perception.... sometimes name alone does lots of trick, imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3929#msg3929re: two words to consider...and a few other things [prosource1]        i also thank you for bringing this suspension topic down to earth.	1
	if you go the lexus ls 460 forum you see will numerous complaints about a high speed wind noise issue several owners are complaining about.	1
	i onlny mention this as an example that any vehical will have some issues or concerns if you visit the particular vehicles forums.	1
	a friend of mine owns a 08 ls and loves it; no wind noise i have riden in it test drove one last week and it is great.	1
	that being said i have driven the genesis (both 6  v8) and was very impressed with it and it is on my short list,it is an outstanding value and yes i put it though the paces during my test drive which included rough pavement the genesis was very poised.	1
	i am considering a used 07 ls or a new v8 genesis with the tech package and yes for me it is a toss up.	1
	the genesis performed that good in my opinion.	1
	the ls is a better car but the genesis is without a doubt the better value.	1
	that is the point of what hyundai has always intended the genesis to be a good value and it is.	1
	what i look for when reading about a supposed problem with any car is how many of them (in this case used genesis) do i see offered used on ebay etc.to date i have seen none.	1
	if the suspension issue was a real issue they would be on the market used in noticeable number...                just my two cents.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3930#msg3930re: hyundai  brand name change [coolpin]        those who have been following the auto industry over the past 10 years and have actually driven or even owned hyundais over that time know that it is not the hyundai of the '80s anymore, and that they offer quality products and have for quite a few years.	1
	'driving is believing,' per hyundai's recent slogan.	1
	consider that toyota, honda, and nissan already had established a long-term reputation for quality cars                 before                launching their luxury divisions.	1
	hyundai has a different challenge:  make more people, all those who have not tried hyundai in the past 10 years, aware that hyundai makes quality cars.	1
	the genesis can help raise the image of the brand such that general perception matches reality.	1
	if a name change would 'do the trick', then we would see new names for gm and chrysler, and most of their brands, right?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3931#msg3931re:driving is believing        i drove a genesis v6, a genesis v8, a pontiac g v8, a bmw 135 , a mazda speed 3 (best value/fun + incredible cornering ability)                i had fun with a 2009  challenger v8 gt all recently.	1
	the best ride by a mile was the 2009 infinity g 37s  sport sedan.	1
	the suspension on the genesis was the worst by far ( like steering a chris craft)                i also had the worst sales experience with the hyundai dealerships.                                '	1
	based on what i have read on other genesis forums, owners have experienced the following problems:                                1. rough ride over tar strips and rough roads (suspension/standard tire issues?)	1
	2. car pulls to one side while driving on the highway (alignment issues?)	1
	hyundai issued a tsb to correct the alignment specs for the genesis                                3. the heating/cooling vents for the rear passengers does not blow cold air.	1
	only hot air.	1
	4. trouble opening the fuel door.	1
	takes several pushes of the button to open the fuel door.	1
	some owners have said they had to go in the trunk and open the fuel door manually, but someone posted that hyundai has a fix for this.	1
	contact your dealer for more info.	1
	5. water leaking into the trunk.	1
	this apparently is a design issue and cannot be fixed without redesigning the trunk.	1
	if your car has been sitting out in the rain and you open the trunk all the water sitting on top of your trunk will drip down to the inside of your trunk.	1
	i recall having this same problem in my 97 geo metro.	1
	the easiest fix is to buy a rubber cargo tray for the trunk so the carpeting does not get wet.	1
	6. slight buzzing sound briefly coming from behind the dash after pushing the start/stop button.	1
	(this might be normal operation)                                7. other random software updates to fix software glitches with xm, nav, etc.'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3932#msg3932re:driving is believing [vjkaty]        since you quoted verbatim from a post from someone else in town hall, it would have been good to cite the source, which is:                 http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.f1b3717/9                                you realize of course that of all the cars you drove, the only one in the same general class as the genesis was the g8?	1
	yet you are comparing handling of, say, the mazdaspeed 3 to a large luxury sedan.	1
	btw, how was the suspension/tire noise of the 3 on tar strips?	1
	the description of the 'water leaking into the trunk' is overstated.	1
	the owners are not saying that 'all the water sitting on top of your trunk will drip down to the inside of your trunk.'	1
	they are saying there is some dripping off the sides of the trunk lid if the trunk lid is opened fully w/o letting water drain off it first (e.g.	1
	opening it half-way, then all the way).	1
	i've seen this same behavior with almost every car i've owned.	1
	some water will drip off the lid and into the trunk when the lid is open all the way.	1
	most of it comes from the bottom edge of the lid, but some from the sides, especially if there is any wind (which often there is, in a rainstorm).	1
	the owners also report the trunk does not                 leak                , which would be a significant problem.	1
	of the problems listed, the only significant one imo is the alignment issue.	1
	you expect a car to track straight.	1
	ride?	1
	that can be checked out during a test drive.	1
	if the buyer of a $35-40k car doesn't take the time to drive the car on the kinds of roads he/she typically travels on, that's not the fault of the car, but a mistake on the part of the buyer.	1
	as noted, there is likely a fix for the balky fuel door (maybe just a little lube will help?	1
	), software glitches, and maybe the alignment issue.	1
	i didn't see enough on the air vent problem to know whether it's just an impatient owner not willing to wait for the hot air to be blown out of the rear vents after the car has been sitting for awhile, or a real problem.	1
	i noticed no one on the genesis owners forum mentioned the problem, so it could simply be a mis-adjusted hvac system on a few (or one) cars.       	1

	if the genesis has so many problems where are the used genesis'?	1
	i agree it is a very simple indicater of a possible problem if they are being unloaded.	1
	and yes the genesis has been on our shores long enough to see used sales if people could not live with them because of bouncey suspensions and hot air only in the rear compartment etc.	1
	it is being offered as a value not to say it is cheap $40k+ is a lot of money and there are plenty of people who could afford to spend more on a car but choose the genesis.	1
	i don't beleive those who could afford higher end are shelling out that kind of money and just living with the problems they would unload it and move on.	1
	i have not seen a single post to that effect thus far on any genesis forum.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3941#msg3941re: hyundai  brand name change [coolpin]        agreed                                this has certainly been talked about here - and probably in general agreement  - except for those dyed in the wool 'h' guys.	1
	one comment - nissan had a better name than hyundai (although not nearly like toyota's)  when it originally followed the lexus lead and certain cars became infinitis.	1
	and, at the time, nissan was not really in a terribly strong financial position to establish a new network of dealerships but they did it anyway.. maybe because of this the 'g20' was nothing remarkable, the i35  simply a relabelled maxima and the flagship 'q' was not nearly as well received as the lexus ls.	1
	this continued for several years, it wasn't until the reworked g35  and the last generation 'ms' that infinti's offerings became anything to brag about - the 'q', of course, remains the step child that it pretty much has always been.	1
	the infiniti i think remains a step below a lexus in most peoples eyes, but it did definitely provide nissan an entree to the luxury car market and  infiniti is improving -  from a perception standpoint.	1
	hyundai seems to want to ignore all this, doesn't seem to understand exactly why it is that many buyers of their premium priced products seem want to 'rebadge' them or simply won't be caught dead at a hyundai dealership in the first place.	1
	between the azera, the veracruz, and of course the genesis hyundai does have a basis for something new and different, but my personal feeling is that any success that hyundai might have selling higher priced models is going to be seriously limited by the brand name and the general character of the dealers that sell them.	1
	people, as shallow as it may be, do buy brands and are concerned about others think - even if the genesis approached the quality/sophistication of those german sedans that hyundai would like us to believe it is comparable to - who's going to care?	1
	- it's still a hyundai.	1
	.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3942#msg3942         'hyundai seems to want to ignore all this, doesn't seem to understand exactly why it is that many buyers of their premium priced products seem want to 'rebadge' them or simply won't be caught dead at a hyundai dealership in the first place.'	1
	where are all the hundreds of photos of people showing off their new korean market badges?	1
	or are a few online posts about rebadging being spun into 'many buyers...'?	1
	maybe some buyers think the korean market genesis emblem looks a lot cooler than the 'h' logo.	1
	'people, as shallow as it may be, do buy brands and are concerned about others think'                                somebody buying a $30,000 to $40,000 avalon or maxima is not looking for                brand prestige.	1
	they just see a nice car they can afford, and they buy it.	1
	many buyers in this price range will be looking at the genesis.	1
	'...but my personal feeling is that any success that hyundai might have selling higher priced models is going to be seriously limited by the brand name and the general character of the dealers that sell them.'	1
	i guess only time will tell.	1
	in the meantime - and i hate to break this to some of you - but this online 'speculating' by consumers is not going to affect the outcome one way or another.	1
	one would be delusional to think otherwise.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3944#msg3944re: hyundai  brand name change [coolpin]        does anyone really think hyundai didn't give long and serious consideration to marketing the genesis thru a stand alone division?	1
	this may have been the single most important marketing decision they had to make.	1
	and while it's good fun to second guess a strategy, let's give hyundai some credit for doing their homework.	1
	my background is in marketing/advertising (don't hold that agianst me) and i can assure you that between hyundai and their advertising agencies, many hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on market research with current hyundai owners, prospective owners, dealers, etc etc.	1
	as has been pointed out many times on this forum, one of hyundai's key marketing obstacles is the brands relatively poor image.	1
	if the genesis effort does nothing more than enhance that imagery and increase consumer acceptance of the hyundai brand, you could argue it is a success.	1
	without even making a profit of the genesis, hyundai may very well increase sales of its volume models to a level that more than makes the effort worthwhile.	1
	along this line, someone made the comment that the genesis advertising was 'ridiculous' as it made comparisons with prestige brands such as bmw.	1
	i would agree if the target audience for the genesis were only current prestige brand owners.	1
	but i don't believe it is.	1
	i think the genesis is mainly targeting buyers of $25-$35,000 cars and the job of the advertising is to make them feel like they are getting a bmw etc.	1
	for little more money than they are used to paying.	1
	certainly this is a realistic goal based on the tangible quality and performance of the car, and is supported by the vast majority of the automotive reviews i have read.	1
	of course the jury is out on the viability of the current strategy.	1
	my initial take was to go the route of lexus, infiniti and acura as they had a 'proven' strategy.	1
	but the more i think about it, maybe hyundai is building the better mousetrap.	1
	so far, sales figures thru november seem to say so: the genesis has outsold the lexus gs, audi a/6, acura rl and closing in on the infiniti m.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3945#msg3945re:  [aqua33v6]         somebody buying a $30,000 to $40,000 avalon or maxima is not looking for                  brand prestige                not so sure about that - the avalon especially and the maxima perhaps a bit less so both carry quite a bit more 'prestige' and 'image'- as illustrated by higher initial prices (%of msrp) both generally command , and definitely higher resale value than the 'comparable' azera, for example.. and it really is because this is a toyota or is a nissan and not because any of these cars is necessarily a whole bunch better than the other.	1
	granted not nearly the 'prestige'  (or the cost) of that german sedan, or that high end lexus/infiniti, but certainly more than any hyundai product.	1
	hyundais are more likely to be bought because of their real and perceived value and not usually to impress anybody.	1
	tell somebody you just wrote a check for 30 something for an avalon, you will get a reassuring nod because that person probably knows that it is the best that toyota makes and that yes they can cost even more than that, tell them that you spent $25+ on any  hyundai and the reaction is more likely' 'i didn't know that korean cars could cost that much'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3946#msg3946re:  [captain2]        captain...i'm surprised with you.	1
	you of all people should know that the avalon isn't toyota's best vehicle.	1
	sorry, as much as you may like to think that...it's actually the fj cruiser that took that honor.	1
	imagine that, one of toyota's trucks being the best they have to offer.	1
	anyway, carry on...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3947#msg3947re:  [captain2]        ahhh, but it's very easy to spin things into any light as we please.	1
	for example, let's look at the owner of a 2007 camry v6 who'd been to the dealership multiple times to have a transmission fixed on a brand new car, and had been given the runaround as to why the transmission wasn't properly fixed each time.	1
	if that were me, i'd be very hesitant to fork out $35,000 for a new avalon, especially since the 2 cars are mechanically identical.	1
	this is just an example of how someone could visit avalon forums and try perpetuating a negative spin on a regular basis.	1
	and, for all we know, my wife's car could be an avalon with some very annoying quality issues                                on the other hand, i am (actually) the owner of a modest $22,000 hyundai, and have had no issues other than faulty sun visors and an accelerator pedal position sensor, both replaced under warranty.	1
	my hyundai dealer has given me exceptionally good service - no hassling with warranty coverage, and each of the above-mentioned issues were fixed within 1 hour of arriving at the service department.	1
	all while i put their gourmet espresso machine to good use.	1
	if i were ready to move up to a nicer car, and spend $30,000 to $35,000, would i consider a 3.8l genesis?	1
	absolutely - based on my current and past experiences with hyundai.	1
	would i also look at a maxima, g35, passat, and tl?	1
	absolutely.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3949#msg3949re: hyundai  brand name change [sandy25]        i am not her to talk about how good the genesis is or isn't.	1
	the sonata and azera both look to be pretty good cars.	1
	however, not selling the genesis as a stand-alone-dealership i believe will be a mistake.	1
	the hyundai dealers are not known for dealing with people that can afford a $40,000.00 plus car.	1
	it's the opposite, those who look towards hyundai are buyers that need help getting in to a car because of credit, lack of down payment etc.	1
	i know this is a gross generalization, and it doesn't apply to the sonata buyer generally.	1
	you look at the very expensive (for hyundai) like the veracruz and the volume just isn't there.	1
	i know a dealer that installs that ugly black matte plastic on the door edges on every car and calls it a 'protection pkg.'	1
	and then charges (or tries too) a couple of hundred dollars.	1
	that is what your dealing with.       	1

	and then charges (or tries too) a couple of hundred dollars.'	1
	that is what your dealing with.'	1
	ok, you know [a dealer] that does this.	1
	to suggest that this applies to all (or most) dealers is a gross generalization.	1
	'the hyundai dealers are not known for dealing with people that can afford a $40,000.00 plus car.'	1
	and most people who walk into a toyota dealership are looking to spend around $20,000 to $25,000, on average.	1
	does this mean toyota should give up trying to sell $35,000 to $40,000 vehicles?	1
	avalons and fj cruisers are only a very small fraction of toyota's annual sales in north america.	1
	does that mean those 2 models are failures?	1
	one big question i have at this point:  why are we talking about a brand in general, instead of the particular model that this discussion thread is supposed to be about?	1
	i thought car enthusiasts like to talk about cars they own, or cars they'd like to own.	1
	why even bother wasting time talking about hyundai if it's such a lowly, insignificant company to begin with?	1
	interesting.	1
	very interesting.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3951#msg3951re: hyundai  brand name change [chuck1]        we could argue 'till death about a separate marque, a separate dealer network, but at the end of the day, it's all speculation.	1
	the reality is as follows - there is no luxury brand for the north american market in the near future; hyundai has deemed an unwise investment at this point.	1
	based on the state of the current economy and the uncertain future, probably a good move on hyundai's part.	1
	trust me when i say this, the genesis has been a very good thing for the hyundai brand; actually, it has been a very good thing for the hyundai brand.	1
	think of how hyundai has improved itself over the last decade or so, the genesis sedan and coupe is another chapter hyundai makes its mark.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3953#msg3953re: hyundai's problem [ksmigel]         you can't change facts.	1
	no, but then you are presenting few facts here, e.g.	1
	your generalization that almost all of hyundai's cars have unrefined, noisy and misbehaving suspensions.	1
	you are forgetting the 'fact' that hyundai has been lauded in the press for the design of the genesis' suspension.	1
	does the genesis have the world's finest suspension, without room for improvement?	1
	i doubt it.	1
	but not 'modern'??	1
	c/d would disagree with you on that.	1
	or that the azera has 'unbelievable' bobbing and porpoising on even a smooth highway--which btw i did not notice during my time in an azera, even on a not-smooth highway?	1
	or that the veracruz has such a terrible suspension that it beat out the rx in a head-to-head comparo by                 motor trend                .	1
	(maybe they ignored how the veracruz rides and handles?)	1
	they also must have ignored how the sonata rides and handles when they voted it the 2nd best mid-sized car out of 10 tested, only behind the passat.	1
	as for cr, yes, they think hyundais have such poor suspensions that they recently rated the santa fe the #1 choice for suvs and the elantra se the #1 choice for small cars.	1
	they also recently ranked the sonata ahead of most mid-sized cars in their tests.	1
	one of those was the new mazda6.	1
	just think how bad the suspensions of those lower-ranked cars must be!	1
	it's also funny i think that you blast hyundai for not having 'modern' suspensions when it offers much more sophisticated suspensions on some of its models than its main competitors do, e.g.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3960#msg3960first time poster here....        have followed this board for quite some time and discussions are very helpful.	1
	we are in the hunt to replace wifes '05 lexus es.	1
	wonderful car.	1
	she previously had an '02 avalon and she loved that car also.	1
	prior to the lexus purchase we drove a maxima, acura tl and others.	1
	i was all over the tl but she felt both 'rode too hard and are noisy'.	1
	you get the idea....she wants quiet and soft ride.	1
	i drive vettes so you can see we differ greatly on what we want in a car.	1
	gotta admit, the lexus is an awesome interstate cruiser and thankfully i get to drive the lexus during the winter.	1
	yup, she needles me to no end about buying a 60k car 'that you can't even drive in the winter'.	1
	anyway, this fall she wanted to drive the lexus rx (cute); the accord and the new maxima.	1
	we did.	1
	yup, they were not quiet enough and rode rough.	1
	i knew that from the beginning but.......                saw the sneak peek pic of the new genesis in car and driver last winter, looked great so we drove one this fall.	1
	impressed to say the least.	1
	quiet, rode great but the price was firm at sticker, 36k.	1
	a similarily equipped es was about 38k but with a 4k discount.	1
	now seeing discounts on the genesis and the v6 with tech stickers at 40k.	1
	appears i can pick one up for somewhere between 36-37k.	1
	a similarily equipped es would sticker at about 42k (buy at about 38k) but not include the rear camera, hid's etc., so content-wise, the genesis wins.	1
	have private party interest in our lexus so it may soon become decision time.	1
	i'm leaning to the genesis, wife doesn't care as she liked both but has a certain amount of loyalty to lexus.	1
	biggest concern (and i don't recall it being discussed) is the historical resale value of the brand name hyundai.	1
	not good!	1
	will the genesis change that?	1
	beats me and i wish they would have gone to seperate stores like toyota and nissan did with the intro of the '89 ls400 and q45.	1
	suspect their bean counters know better that i but realize the expense of doing so would be huge $$$.	1
	time will tell if this was a good/bad decision.	1
	don't know if i have presented any germane questions but any thoughts out there will be appreciated.	1
	as to our host 'pat'....can you pass some of that punch over the internet to me??	1
	i'm at home and hereby designate myself as driver.	1
	cheers to all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3961#msg3961re: first time poster here.... [gbjerke]        i faced the same decision and selected the genesis over the es.	1
	they were both fine cars with all the 'features'.	1
	subjectively, i just thought the interior of the genesis looked better and was more comfortable and i really liked the way it drove and handled.	1
	i also liked the idea of it being more unique and 'rare' than the es which has been around for a while.	1
	the clincher was the 27 month lease with almost no interest cost.	1
	so, at the end of 27 months if you aren't happy you can just walk away and not worry about resale value.	1
	or, if you loved the car, buy it and enjoy the excellent warranty coverage       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3970#msg3970battery dead again        if anyone has been following my previous posts, you have seen my dismay over the fact that my genesis can't be parked for more than two days without something completely draining the battery.	1
	the first time, the technician's computer showed a defective battery, which they replaced.	1
	the second time, the battery checked out o.k.	1
	and they asked that i leave the car with them so that they coould try to trace the problem.	1
	due to my schedule, i could not leave it with them at that time.	1
	now, one month later, i parked the car again in my garage on december 23rd without needing it until today (dec. 26th).	1
	dead as a hammer!!!	1
	i jump started it and left it with the dealer for them to try to replicate the problem.	1
	i will let you know what they find ... if they can determine the problem.	1
	to say that i am frustrated is a huge understatement.	1
	i am not about to own a so-called luxury car that can't sit for three days without needing a jump-start!	1
	i have almost 13,000 miles on the car and i have been posting my impressions every few thousand miles.	1
	i like most things about it but i can't muster up any enthusiasm today or ever again until they get it fixed enough not to leave me anticipating being stranded fairly often.	1
	if any of you are experiencing the battery-drain problem and want to compare notes, you can pull up my previous posts.       	1

	dead as a hammer!!!	1
	there must be a drain on the battery.	1
	no way should any car die in 3 days.	1
	my '06 avalon which is everybit as computerized as the genesis has sat in the airport parking lot for 2 1/2 weeks in the dead of winter and starts right up.	1
	my 99 s10 also sits for 3 weeks without problem as well.	1
	keep complaining to the dealer and/or get another dealer involved.	1
	the only thing that i may suggest is that you mentioned you park in your garage, do you leave your keys in the car?	1
	maybe the 'smart key' system is draining the battery because it is in close proximity and constantly active thinking you are sitting in the car ready to start it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3977#msg3977re: battery dead again [colegar]        i don't know if they can do much about the battery issue.	1
	this is the same issue as with the azera.	1
	i can't park my car for more than 2 or 3 days or it's dead.	1
	i already replaced the battery once and the car had only 16,000 miles on it.	1
	since i have read several instances of the battery drain, i don't know if it's a problem inherent in the electrical system, or if there's a defect of some kind.	1
	i have linked below some references to it in the azera forums.	1
	most have a hard time identifying the problem.	1
	one hyundai expert found a missing rubber bumper  from the hood that pressed a switch which activated the theft system.	1
	if left unactivated, other components remained on and slowly drained the battery.	1
	maybe the genesis problem is also linked to that defect.	1
	maybe not.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/3978#msg3978re: mt coty results [ricwhite]        although the gen does most everything well, and does so for 10k less it really didn't break new ground (except in value).	1
	the gt-r to put it simply, blew the doors off the barn, and competes w/ vehicles costing 150k more.	1
	not as practical as the gen for sure, but as far as pushing technology to it's limits and breaking new ground the gtr is clearly coty, and it is practical for those in that demographic for sure!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3979#msg3979re: battery dead again [tjc78]        no, i never leave my key in the car.	1
	also, you will see in my previous posts that the first two times it went dead it was sitting in an airport garage for three or four days.	1
	the third time it was in my garage at home.	1
	i have owned more cars than i like to admit and i have spent years traveling at least half the time.	1
	i too have left cars sitting while on trips out of the country but this is the first one that is only good for two days without going dead.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3980#msg3980re: battery dead again [ricwhite]        thanks!	1
	i pulled up the link to the azera battery problem and some of the posts sound very similar to the problem my genesis has.	1
	in fact, i plan to show the technician at the dealership those posts to stimulate his his diagnostic approach.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3981#msg3981re: battery dead again [colegar]        just a thought, my friend had a similar problem and it turned out to be the alternator.	1
	the battery was not getting charged and would just die.	1
	they can test it at the dealer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3983#msg3983re: first time poster here.... [sanjaysdca]        sanjay...to be honest, i'm really not surprised.	1
	anyone that really gets in a genesis and takes one for a spin....                                comparing it to the lexus es really is unfair, if you had said you would take it over the gs...i'd be more impressed.	1
	one thing i trluy dig about the genesis is that you can burn regular gas in it, the others are premium fuel only.	1
	granted, gas prices have fallen, but...we see how much hurt it put on folks when it spiked.	1
	another issue is maintenance costs...every other car you've mentioned from lexus, infiniti and audi are very costly in the maintenance dept.	1
	in comparison to the rest of the hyundai line-up, it could be more costly, but compared to the premium brands...maybe quite less.	1
	can't really speak on that with confidence, but it would seem to make sense.	1
	i've had my azera for almost 3 years now and the single most expensive maintenance cost i've paid is $125 for the transmission flush.	1
	other than that, it's only been oil changes ($35 for oil  filter x 8 = $280), brake pads (2 sets = $135) and wiper blades (2 sets                $40/set = $80), oh...and i replaced the oem battery for $75...a grand total of $615 covering 2.8 years  63k miles.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3984#msg3984re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]        if you are going to 'compare' a genesis with a lexus product - with a straight face - then wouldn't the better comparison be between the ls at $70k versus the the genesis v8 at more than 20 grand less than that?	1
	the  genesis much closer in size and purpose (soft highway cruiser) than the gs which is more a midsize car smaller than even the sonata.	1
	i doubt that you would find many that wouldn't take the ls, - if the $25k or so (and the badge, sophistication, engineering etc.)	1
	mean little.	1
	ibut i do agree that folks that would be worried about spending 20 cents+  extra or so per gallon would be precisely those that might consider the genesis seriously.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3985#msg3985re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        you are right to a degree...size-wise...the ls would make more sense in comparison to the genesis, however...if you're going for features and options, the gs and genesis are almost neck and neck in that regard.	1
	the size difference isn't really that huge between the two either to be honest.	1
	however, the point would still be that the genesis would be a better value than any of the lexus cars from v-6 to v-8 models.	1
	personally, when the new ls hit the streets i fell in love with it.	1
	it's a very sexy car (to me at least), however...seeing the genesis, while maybe not quite as sexy as the ls, it's still very eye catching and i can save $30k to boot?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3986#msg3986jazzed up genesis        okay...i got excited when i finally spotted a genesis in person on the roads in my area, but the other morning on the way to the bank i got to see not only a genesis, but one that was 'hooked' up.	1
	what i mean was...the owner had put some very nice 20' deep dish rims with at least a 3' lip.	1
	the genesis was that beautiful ice blue color and he had the windows tinted.	1
	it looked very, very classy....wish i could've gotten pics of it to post.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3987#msg3987re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]         the size difference isn't really that huge between the two either to be hones                really - sit in the back seat of an ls then go sit in a gs.	1
	given that both pay the price of the relatively space inefficient rwd layout..                'value' has never been a problem for the korean car mfgrs , perception is       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3988#msg3988re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        no...i was referring to the overall interior space between the genesis and the gs.	1
	heck, the azera has almost as much interiror space as the ls.	1
	unless of course you get the executive stretched version of the ls.	1
	perception is something that will change over time if they keep on their current path.	1
	one thing i've found is that most folks that have something negative to say about hyundai vehicles in general, haven't even been in one...they go based on what they've heared.	1
	i personally know a few folks that used to talk about how bad hyundai was, but when they saw my sonata and my current azera, they raised their eyebrows.	1
	now that they've seen the genesis and actually test driven one...oh, they have definitely changed their tune.	1
	i will say this much,  if you have never been in one, driving a current hyundai may not make you buy one, but...it will certainly give you a different perspective of what their vehicles are about if you previously had a negative image about them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3989#msg3989re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]        having not spent any time in the genesis yet, i would be surpised if it wasn't  significantly bigger than the gs, just like the difference between the gs and std.	1
	ls.	1
	wheelbase and other vehicle dimensions much closer between the genesis and ls as opposed to the gs/genesis.	1
	i have driven the azera and thought it was a rather remarkable achievement, but tempered that judgement by subpar fe and a marshmallow soft (seemingly sloppy)suspension - and  i drive an avalon as you know (albeit the touring model) of all things.	1
	the sonata v6 same 'problem' although not as 'soft' as the non-se camrys and a too cheap interior.	1
	not that i blame hyundai ('soft' sells in this country) but from a lot of what i read - suspension tuning/sophistication perhaps not quite in hyundai's bag of tricks yet....                it is possible to have a well controlled and 'soft/pleasant ' ride - all at the same time - they call them bmws, mbs, amd ftm lss.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3990#msg3990re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        sidebar...the fe on the azera is no worse than that of the maximas of the same model year and nobody complains about the fe on those.	1
	that's funny.	1
	the suspension is soft and that's simply becuase the azera is nothing more than a highway cruiser...all it was intended to be.	1
	with a more progressive suspension, it has potential though.	1
	i'm sure hyundai will eventually get the memo on the tuning of the suspensions and do something about it to make it a better fit.	1
	honestly, i think the genesis could use a sport tuned suspension because the car really makes you wanna drive it from the moment you step on the gas pedal.	1
	the interior differences between the genesis/ls and the gs...are merely .5' here, 1.25' there and 2' somewhere else, however...when it comes to pricing, the gs is closest in terms of what you pay vs. what you get.	1
	heck, even the base es starts out costing more than the base genesis v-6.	1
	i think the genesis vs. gs comparo was good in some aspects, but not so good in others.	1
	i mean...they could have compared the genesis 3.8 to the gs-350 and the genesis 4.6 to the gs-460 and done very well.	1
	granted, the genesis 3.8 won't turn in the performance numbers of the gs-350, but it won't be that far off.	1
	in essence, the genesis gives you close to the size of the ls, with the features and amenities of the gs with a price that would net you an es.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3991#msg3991re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]        it is hyundai, not me, that seemingly wants us to consider in lieu of those truly luxury 'sports sedans'.	1
	if all you want to talk about is 'bling for the buck' there are very very few cars that will stand up to any comparison with those made in korea - or alabama.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3992#msg3992re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        to be honest, they are making a very valid and well heard statement that's hard to ignore my friend.	1
	they may not be able to offer you exactly what mb, bmw, lexus or infinity can offer in terms of intangibles, but...when one can save anywhere from $7-30k (depending on what models you compare to the genesis), the level of luxury you can get with the genesis really does have quite an appeal to it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3993#msg3993comparing several .	1
	.	1
	read the latest issue of                   consumer reports.	1
	perhaps their write up will help you decide whether or not you care                for the genesis compared to some others that were tested.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3994#msg3994re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]         level of luxury you can get with the genesis                again you talk about 'luxury' as if it was some defining collection of doodads - something that i have issues with - i mean what is it then that you can get on a genesis that is not available on an appropriate azera, avalon, or even going lower a grand marquis.	1
	we've certainly been thru this all before, but a true luxury car has little to do with optional or even standard equipment, performance specs etc because it too is a perception.	1
	yes -  that bmw does come with lots and lots of your precious doodads (hell, the genesis may actually have more of them), but none of that has anything to do with one  being a true 'luxury' sedan, the other not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3995#msg3995re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        captain...i didn't mention anything in terms of amenities and features equating to luxury.	1
	the statement was simply that the level of luxury you get with the genesis.	1
	nothing more, nothing less.	1
	you are trying to put words into my fingers.	1
	i speak in terms of having spent time in an actual genesis sedan.	1
	i actually sat in all 5 seating locations to get a feel for the car, spent time in the driver's seat (on the showroom floor) just sitting in the seat to take in the ambience of the car.	1
	when i got to test drive one, i didn't just fire it up, put it in drive and go.	1
	i took the time to enjoy and soak up the environment around me as it came to life.	1
	the feel of the surfaces, the appeal to the senses in every aspect.	1
	so...when i speak of luxury in terms of the genesis, it's not in regards to the features and amenities it offers (even though, to a degree, gadgets are factored in).	1
	i'm talking about the feeling one gets while actually taking the car in completely.	1
	so please, stop trying to speak for me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3996#msg3996re: first time poster here.... [allmet33]         the feel of the surfaces, the appeal to the senses in every aspect                now you're getting closer and, just like i said a perception, because those same surfaces and those same sensory appeals can be found on your azera, my avalon etc.	1
	etc.	1
	it's all a question of our individual predispositions - in this case.	1
	in other words, if you think you are about to experience some sort of automotive nirvana - it will likely be a self-fulfilling prophecy.	1
	another example of this might be the mks, another ford rebadging effort with lots of doodads to be sure, and even with a brand name that most people still agree means luxury, but is it?	1
	i would contend to you that no it isn't simply because it is so closely related to the ford 500 it came from - and if you are buying a ford you can't buy a luxury car - just like if you buy a hyundai you can't buy a luxury car either.	1
	nothing specifically negative (or positive) about the car itself, only those nasty perceptions....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/3997#msg3997re: first time poster here.... [captain2]         because those same surfaces and those same sensory appeals can be found on your azera, my avalon etc.	1
	etc                                you haven't spent time in a genesis, have you?	1
	if you have, you wouldn't be making that statement.	1
	i own an azera and i cross shoped the avalon and no...the surfaces do not feel the same in the genesis compared to the other two.	1
	nor does the feel of the cabin.	1
	sorry, captain...it's the truth.	1
	and no, it's not an expectation of automotive nirvana, it's about feeling pretty doggone nice sitting in it.	1
	a level of nice that's above that feeling one gets from sitting in the azera, avalon or maxima.	1
	going from my azera into the genesis...night and day.	1
	going from my azera into the avalon...sorta like going from one room in my house to another.	1
	different look, same feel.	1
	i base my statements off of actually spending time in the vehicles i'm talking about.	1
	before you actually say something one way or other...do the same thing so you can at least know what you're talking about.	1
	if you reach out and touch the dash of the genesis, it has the pliable, pebble texture of the higher end cars.	1
	the azera has the pebbled hard plastic with no pliability upon touch and from my recollection...neither did the avalon.	1
	the touch of the controls has a nice feel, not that common everyday feel you get in cars like the azera, avalon  maxima.	1
	it's just something that makes it feel a notch above.	1
	would you please stop with the bs and trying to convince people that you can't buy a luxury car from hyundai.	1
	as much as you care not to admit or accept the fact...it's a reality                                by the way...have you sat in a ford taurus and then turned around and sat in the mks?	1
	i didn't think so...i think if you did you would be greatly surprised to see there's a huge difference in the impact.	1
	it's just so sad that you believe luxury cars can only come from europe or japan.	1
	the world grows smaller on a daily basis and because of that, the playing field gets more and more level.       	1

	lincoln since it no longer makes anything unique doesn't pass muster anymore, the genesis blew it's chance to be a 'luxury' anything when the decision was made to try to sell it at hyundai dealers.	1
	if 'genesis' was a brand, marketed independently,  the first genesis car, as we now know it, might easily have become a new entrant in the luxury car ranks.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4000#msg4000re: first time poster here.... [koury]        because he has nothing better to do than to be controversial and standoff-ish.	1

	the only perception that is shallow is yours.	1
	you keep refering back to the dealers, which i will admit and concur that the dealership network could be a major hurdle for the genesis.	1
	however, the sedan itself, no matter how you want to look it...is a luxury sedan.	1
	even when the es was nothing more than a glorified camry, it was still considered luxury.	1
	the infinity i30 was nothing more than a luxo-version of the maxima and it was still accepted as a luxury sedan.	1
	the genesis is not based on anything else, it is it's own animal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4002#msg4002re: first time poster here.... [koury]        what i think i said is that i haven't spent any time with one yet - which i haven't.	1
	sitting in one in a showroom is a different story, something i have taken the time to do - and also quite a bad way to evaluate anything.	1
	even a test drive is a suspect means to really truly evaluate anything.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4003#msg4003re: first time poster here.... [captain2]        sitting in the car whether it's in your driveway, the showroom floor, on the sales lot or anywhere else is hardly bad.	1
	it allows you to actually just sit in the car and take it all in.	1
	the test drive is just an extension of that, but now you're saying that simply sitting in and test driving isn't enough to determine a luxury feel?	1
	lmao  i truly think you're just pushing buttons for effect now.	1
	if you can't determine luxury from sitting in and test driving a vehicle, then maybe you're so much the car guy you desire everyone to think you are.	1
	just admit the fact that it kills you that hyundai had the audacity to create and bring to market a luxury sedan that could be more widely accessible than the flagship offerings from any of the premium brands.	1
	in your world, i'm sure this is truly tragic.        	1

	[donna388]        just saw the cr article.	1
	a little surprised with some of the comparison vehicles.	1
	a maxima and a g8?	1
	i guess 'high end luxury sedan' can mean just about anything these days.	1
	especially when everyone else is comparing the genesis to bmw, mercedes, and lexus.	1
	looks like the car geeks are having a hard time placing the genesis in any particular segment.	1
	in the end, the genesis still gets the thumbs up!	1
	no matter what the competition is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4007#msg4007re: comparing several .	1
	.	1
	[rlejr66]        cr compared the genesis to the maxima and g8 because they hadn't been tested by cr yet, so they were lumped in with the genesis to make a test group for an article.	1
	in actuality, cr compared the genesis against all vehicles in its price class, most of which they have already tested.	1
	that is how cr groups cars, by price and type (sedan, suv etc.).	1
	since the 3 cars are similar in price, they get lumped together for rating purposes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4008#msg4008re: comparing several .	1

	[rlejr66]         looks like the car geeks are having a hard time placing the genesis in any particular segment                                because the gen has it's own class 'bargain luxury', entry-level luxury may apply, but that's usually smaller cars such as bmw3, infinity g, lexus is, etc.	1
	and although they're all great cars they're not a bargain.	1
	not sure where else you'd place the vehicle~how 'bout 'entry level large bargain luxury'        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4009#msg4009re: comparing several .	1
	.	1
	[blnewto]        curious to know...what would make the genesis 'entry level'?	1
	if you use base that off the 3-series, es, g and c-class...the genesis definitely offers more.	1
	i certainly agree with you on the bargain point...you can pretty much get any of the premium entry level models fully loaded and pay what you would for a fully loaded genesis 4.6 for maybe a couple thousand more.	1
	well...pretty soon, the genesis will have a brother on the market.	1
	kia will be bringing their version based on the next generation azera platform.	1
	so far it's called the vg.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4012#msg4012re: comparing several .	1
	.	1
	[allmet33]        the kia 'vg' wouldn't be the brother of the genesis, but the azera.	1
	it probably would have some name other than amanti - vg is the codename used internally.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4013#msg4013re: comparing several .	1
	.	1
	[joe97]        so basically...the vg will be replacing the amanti then, right?	1
	from what i'm seeing, the vg will be longer and wider than the current amanti which would make it bigger than the azera...like the genesis.	1
	what gives?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4014#msg4014re:  [zone4]         so if the genesis was made by bmw, mercedes-benz, lexus, or infinity would it then be considered a luxury vehicle?	1
	almost certainly, the only difference being that bmw/mb and the like have no interest is being any kind of value leader, they simply want to be the best       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4015#msg4015         almost certainly, the only difference being that bmw/mb and the like have no interest is being any kind of value leader, they simply want to be the best                                the funny thing here is...if you were to go over to europe, they treat mb's and bmw's just like we treat the avalon, maxima, azera, camry and accord...like everyday cars that aren't that special.	1
	just because hyundai may be a value based company when it comes to the auto industry, that doesn't mean they don't strive to be the best.	1
	if that's the case, they wouldn't bother with making the strides they've made.	1
	here's the kicker though...if you were presented a genesis with no badging to indicate that it was made by hyundai, you would have no problems saying and accepting the car as a luxury sedan.	1
	you have qualified that repeatedly by saying that it's not a luxury car because of the italic 'h' on the trunk.	1
	bottom line is...the car itself (which is what we've been discussing) is a luxury sedan...it just happens to be made by a non-luxury company.	1
	you know...i've come to the realization that hyundai isn't for those stuck in their preconceived ways of how things should be.	1
	hyundai is as progressive a company as you can find and put an exclamation point on that by creating the genesis and marketing under the hyundai brand.	1
	as hard as it is for you to accept, it would seem that there are quite a few premium car owners that buy into it as well as witnessed by those that have traded bmw's, mb's, lexus  infiniti's in for a genesis, or the ones that were shopping the mid-level premium sedans adding the genesis to their shopping list, and even the ones that initially wanted a gs, m, e-class or 5-series actually buying a genesis because they get a high level of luxury compared to the price they would have paid for the premium sedan.	1
	the savings coupled with what the genesis offers as a car must be enough to sway those folks.	1
	heck...hyundai is doing something right if the genesis sales are keeping up with the premium sedans that it compares to...don't ya think?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4016#msg4016re:  [captain2]         the only difference being that bmw/mb and the like have no interest is being any kind of value leader, they simply want to be the best                                this is a truly ignorant statement.	1
	rolls royca and lambo don't have any interest in being a value leader.	1
	bmw and mb have a huge commitment to being a value leader.	1
	the 1 and 3 series and c-class are a testament to that and they directly compete against this hyundai.       	1

	to some, it's a car that most people can't afford.	1
	b. to some, it's a car that has top of the line quality, comfort, power, and features                  c. to some, it's a car with an exclusive luxury badge regardless of price or quality. '	1
	choice b would be for those doodad freaks that feel a luxurious car and a luxury car are the same thing - choice c for all the 'brand snobs' out there., choice a  is interesting as it implies (and requires)  a certain level of exclusivity.	1
	but, in any case, the genesis comes up aces in one of the 3 qualifications and fails in the other two.	1
	give me an appropriately butt kissing 'genesis' dealer., a price perhaps $10k or $15k more than what it is, then i give you a true luxury car, that appears to need nothing more than some suspension tuning and refinement to be truly competitive to those german and japanese cars that hyundai would like to to be.       	1

	the 1, 3 and c are all 'entry level', only a means to get more american butts in their productss and compete with something like a genesis only in their price.	1
	have you ever driven a 135 - perhaps the definition of what a 'sports sedan' should be', and it is tiny and anything but luxurious - quite the opposite of the genesis.	1
	although i'm sure there are a few exceptions, i sincerely doubt that anybody in bavaria or stuttgart is really giving the genesis anything more than a passing glimpse.	1
	this may indeed be a big mistake on their part, it was in 1989 when they dismissed the ls also pretty much out of context.	1
	nonetheless, the day that the buyer of the the big genuine luxury sedans like the a6/a8, the e and ss, the gs and lss, the 5s and 7s, the ms etc.	1
	start flocking to the hyundai dealer because they feel it is a better car (or at least a comparable one) is the day that the genesis is competing with the 'big boys'.       	1

	so see...a luxury nameplate can make a car that doesn't even meet the standards of luxurious and it's okay, but a non-luxury nameplate making a luxury vehicle is impossible, right?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4020#msg4020re:  [captain2]        only if you go by that one person's ideology of believing those are the only way a car can qualify as a luxury sedan.	1
	fortunately for us, there are plenty that can think for themselves.	1
	of course, that line of thinking fits with yours, so of course you'll buy into it.	1
	like i said...if you were presented a genesis with no way of knowing it was made by hyundai, i guarantee you would be calling it a luxury sedan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4021#msg4021re:  [allmet33]        confusing 'luxurious' with 'luxury' again, are we?	1
	a bmw branded product can be 'luxury' with rollup windows - very few marques can make that claim.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4022#msg4022re:  [allmet33]        i don't know why you guys keep arguing with captain?	1
	he obviously is closed minded and you're not going to convince him that the genesis is a luxury vehicle, which it is without a doubt.	1
	i have sat in one while looking into buying a sonata, bought a ford fusion by the way, and if thats not luxury i must be some backward hillbilly.	1
	if he wants to go out and spend 10k more so he can feel better about himself then it's his loss.	1
	if i could ever convince my wife that we don't need to replace her mountaineer with another suv or crossover, i would definitely consider the genesis.	1
	maybe it's because i can't afford to spend more that 40k for a car nor would i want to waste that kind of money on a vehicle..       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4032#msg4032re: first time poster here....        i did the original post on above and appreciate the feedback.	1
	to answer some of the questions posed.....                someone suggested i look at the gs, infiniti m and a6 as a comparo.	1
	done before.	1
	before we bought our es, my wife was all over the gs as it looked great to her.	1
	drove one and she pretty much liked it but drove an es right after that and the gs went out the window.	1
	believe i mentioned she wanted a soft/quiet ride and the es was her choice....good deal for me as it saved thousands of $$$.	1
	infiniti??	1
	nope, too rough riding and not as quiet.	1
	you get the drift of all this.	1
	as to the audi, no question, the interior is as fine as you can find and it looks good.	1
	however, my son had an a4 which spent more time at the dealership for warranty work than you can imagine so an audi was out of the question.	1
	another poster mentioned fwd vs. rwd.	1
	understand the benefits of fwd in snow country but i much prefer rwd and here in n. illinois, we usually don't get that much snow...except for last year and so far this year!	1
	to me, that is not an issue.	1
	another was to compare the genesis to the gs or ls lexus.	1
	i've covered the gs bit and think the ls is probably the finest of cars but the price point is huge as compared to the genesis and while i would love to have an ls in the garage, it becomes a question of whether it is worth it....dare i say, some 30k difference.	1
	it may well be worth it...don't know.	1
	wife also thinks the ls is too big!	1
	bottom line, she wants quiet along with a soft ride and the genesis we drove hit it on the head and for pricing it competes very well with the es.	1
	one question i posed that was never responded to was the historical dramatic decline in values of the hyundai nameplate vs. other  brands.	1
	my fear is that this is a car that should be bought a year from now for a fraction of original sticker.	1
	let's say i go for a 40k genesis and buy for 36k and in a year i see these cars selling for 20k.	1
	that folks, is a huge hit in the shorts.	1
	this may well not happen but is of concern to me.	1
	thoughts??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4033#msg4033re: first time poster here.... [gbjerke]        it will happen.	1
	you can buy practically any one-year-old luxury car for a huge discount off original msrp or even original purchase price.	1
	for example, how about a 2007 525i for $27k?	1
	or a                 2008                sts v8 for $22k?	1
	so if that thought bothers you, why not wait until next year and pick up a lightly-used genesis for a fraction of the original sticker?	1
	you could probably get one with the hyundai certified warranty, i.e.	1
	10 years bumper-to-bumper coverage.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4034#msg4034re: first time poster here.... [gbjerke]        sure the hyundai will depreciate quite a bit more than the lexus, but if you're eyeing the es350 you're getting much more car w/ the genesis.	1
	the gs would be a more accurate comparo, as would the infiniti m. the es is really just a lux'd out camry although it is lux'd out quite well                so what i'm saying is your genesis may drop an additional 2-3k off an es, but you'll still have significantly more car w/ your genesis imo.       	1

	our 5 mi.	1
	test ride before buying the car was over a country road, across a rr track, onto a stretch of us-101 hwy  back to the dealer.	1
	we didn't notice the hard suspension, but looking back, i remember the salesman in the back seat was continually talking about different features,  that was probably distracting.	1
	the problem w/the hard suspension surfaced on our trip over xmas from the sf bay area to orange county  san diego when we had to travel down  back i-5.	1
	especially in the right lane where the trucks beat-up the road, i felt like i was driving a jeep wrangler as the jostling literally caused my upper body to move back  forth as we traveled over the bumps  dips.	1
	unfortunately, the jostling aggravated a back problem, so im realizing that, as is, the genesis isn't the car for us since we drive to s. ca 4-5 times/yr.	1
	i'm going to talk w/the dealer  see if there are any suggestions for improving the ride.	1
	i've read the thread in the genesisowners.com website  don't want to put weights in the trunk to help,  am hesitant to reduce air pressure to soften the ride, which in turn would also reduce mpg  tire life.	1
	fortunately, i was going to sell my old car to my nephew  deliver it in feb. now i can keep that if the suspension problem doesnt get resolved,  sell the genesis, unfortunate both because its a great car except for the suspension,  even w/only ~700 miles on it, itll cost us some $.       	1

	captain, ol' boy, that day has already arrived.	1
	as a genesis owner for five months  9000 miles, i've monitored this site occasionally and simply cannot understand why you spend so much time posting about a car that you freely admit you've never driven                 nor even seen                !	1

	while i concede that genesis has different strengths and weaknesses relative to the 5-series, it's a very compelling package, and i have no regrets about trading in my bimmer...which, by the way, cost me $22k more than the genesis six years ago!	1

	very odd.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4045#msg40452009 genesis handles like a couch        well, i got very excited about the prospect of a car with a 375 hp v-8 that looks like it could be a mercedes or a bmw or a lexus - well-executed in every view inside and out - and with every conceivable extra known to autodom for $42k out the door.	1
	two flaws that killed it for me.	1
	the suspension is definitely designed for comfort - handling is very mushy - almost like driving a couch through a 30 mph turn onto a side street.	1
	the front wheels could not handle the g forces.	1
	the other flaw was the absence of low-end torque.	1
	the car eventually gets going but it was much too tame off the line.	1
	i wasn't looking to leave rubber - just looking for the grunt to show up a lot earlier than it does.	1
	this said - it's a hell of a car for the money depending on what's important to the owner.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4046#msg4046re: first time poster here.... [gbjerke]        i would suggest at least looking at and driving a cpo, say, 2006 ls 430. these can be had at around $35k with mileage around 30k.	1
	you get a lexus 3 year new car bumper to bumper warranty or up to 100k.	1
	drive it, you'll buy it.	1
	i do have to admit that i drove the genesis and really, really liked it.	1

	i wasn't looking to leave rubber - just looking for the grunt to show up a lot earlier than it does                                i respectively disagree,  one thing to note; tire pressure plays  a huge part in the genesis performance, also after driving the last 2800 plus miles i have discovered that esc steps in way too early.	1
	here is how i get performance from a standstill and some of my impressions;                                1  front tire pressure is set to 32 psi and rear tires to 35 psi.	1
	2  i switch the esc to the off position.	1
	3  i no longer  smash the accelerator any more, rather press the accelerator slowly taking at least two seconds to get to the first gate                4  after the first 500 miles the v8 really begun to open up                                it is not as neck snapping as my previous weekend vehicle (2000 transam ws6), however traveling in comfort is more than worth the 0.5 seconds in 0-60mph difference                                 i agree with you it is not as stiff as 5 series but certainly not as mushy as lexus, and if one takes a 90 angle at 45 mph there is a feeling of body roll but the car will preform the maneuver as if it is on rail tracks.	1

	from the 'official' reviews, i get the impression that the genesis handles more like a g8 than a lexus ls or even gs, but the forums trend the other way.	1
	suspension metrics include:                1. feedback through steering wheel (numb?)	1
	2. on-center steering precision (straight-line wander?)	1
	3. suspension stiffness                4. suspension travel limits (hit the stops on rough roads?)	1
	5. damping (certain speed/road combination induce bouncing?)	1
	i'm wondering if the 'official' reviewers concluded that the genesis steering was not numb and therefore was not like a lexus.       	1

	hmmmmmmmmmmmmm...it would seem the two go hand in hand my friend.	1
	by definition, luxury is a condition of abundance or great ease and comfort.	1

	not as a 'luxury sedan' .	1
	this despite the review itself talking a whole bunch about how 'luxurious' the genesis actually is.	1
	obviously has a whole lot to do with price and the badge.	1
	you can rail on all you want about the all the available doodads but if the genesis is ever going to graduate into that 'luxury' league it does need a higher price and a new place to be sold.	1

	i'll bet you dollars to donuts that they used the genesis 3.8 because none of the other cars offer a v-8 (except for the lucerne, but even the v-8 lucerne doesn't stack up against the genesis 3.8).	1
	if you group it according to what the car actually offers you...then it would be compared to the likes of the gs, m, e, 5-series and cars of such ilk.	1
	now you're back-tracking because the is, es, 3-series (some), c-class, g's and such cars all cost less than the genesis, so none of them can be luxury cars based on what you said.	1
	so now...if the genesis cost $50k, then and only then could it be a luxury car!	1
	dude...it's like you're treading water with your hands  feet tied together!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4060#msg4060re:  [allmet33]         now you're saying if bmw produced a car similar to a base model corolla...it would be a luxury car just because it has bmw on it?	1
	basically yes, but you don't seem to understand why.	1
	it is the fact that bmw doesn't produce any car intended for the masses (like the corolla) and does generally bless all its cars with a degree of engineering acumen and sophistication not found elsewhere that qualifies even the lowest trim 1 series as a 'luxury car'.	1
	nothing to do with smelly leather, quiet boulevard rides, fancy arss steros systems etc.	1
	etc.	1
	this, perhaps more than anything else,  is what differentiates the true 'luxury car' mfgrs.	1
	from the chevys, the fords, the toyotas, the hyundais etc etc.	1
	of the world                would a 135 with roll-up windows still be a luxury car, certainly, but only because the manufacturer would not allow it any other way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4061#msg4061re:  [captain2]         it is the fact that bmw doesn't produce any car intended for the masses (like the corolla) and does generally bless all its cars with a degree of engineering acumen and sophistication not found elsewhere that qualifies even the lowest trim 1 series as a 'luxury car'.	1
	how so my dear captain...because of price?	1
	well then, the genesis isn't intended for the masses then is it?	1
	and yet with all the engineering acumen  sophistication that acura puts into their cars, they aren't considered luxury with the likes of lexus and infinity.	1
	what gives?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4062#msg4062re:  [allmet33]        as i have said before and the cr grouping seems to confirm - put a 50 grand pricetag on it and change its name and then it likely becomes 'luxury'.	1
	the cr test wonderfully complimentary, and even though they talk about how well appointed the car is at some length - they still classify it is a  'upscale' large sedan'.	1
	you suppose it has something to do with price and brand name ?	1
	at least in this article, cr's classifications do seem to define 'luxury' as something north of $50k.	1
	how else would you explain the exclusion of the mks (at a mere $41k) from the 'luxury' ranks, but include the dts (another rebadge job) , for example, at 50?.	1
	maybe you don't agree with the genesis and/or cars like the mks being classified as 'merely' upscale, but we really are only talking about perceptions here and not doodads.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4063#msg4063re:  [captain2]        you really would like for the grouping to be the confirmation that you need to validate the point your trying to make.	1
	if you try to go along with the cr classification, then it blows the point you made about the bmw 1-series being a luxury car...doesn't it?	1
	let's take a look at the word 'upscale'.	1
	by definition... relating to, being, or appealing to affluent consumers ; also : of a superior quality.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4064#msg4064re:  [allmet33]        i don't think that there is any doubt that acura has a decidedly more entry level luxury perception,  and although i suppose the rl (at $50k) is going to meet most definitions, i don't believe that the brandname itself is thought of on quite the same level as lexus and/or infiniti.	1
	.	1
	honda puts a lot of effort into making the acuras as something for the drivers among us,  the tl , for example, is a wonderful car, but a bmw it ain't, and nor do i believe is it perceived to be.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4065#msg4065re:  [captain2]        once again...you back-track on the very words you put out there.	1
	just admit that you're a hater, simple and clear.	1
	you have already admitted that you haven't spent any time in a genesis.	1
	you claim it can't be luxury unless it's $50k+, but only after you read some cr report.	1
	yet before that, you were quick to claim the bmw 1-series a luxury car.	1
	i think you make statements just for the sake of being controversial, but the problem is...you're the only one making the statements.	1
	i mean, it would be different if others shared your point of view, but so far...none have.	1
	that in itself should tell you something.	1
	cr is hardly the authority of what is luxury and what isn't.	1
	they simply tell you if you're getting a good/bad car for your money.	1
	as i said earlier, your a hater and your favorite flavor of hater-ade...hyundai!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4066#msg4066re:  [allmet33]        dictionary definitions mean little in the world of perceptions.	1
	tell somebody you bought a bmw for 50 or 60 large and folks understand you have spent a lot of  (or even too much) money for something that is likely the one of the best.	1
	same can be said for lexus, infiniti, and mb to slightly lesser degrees.	1
	tell them you spent 15 or 20 grand                 less                 than that on a hyundai then they think you should be committed.	1
	that is a unfortunate (and probably unfair)  reality, without spending a whole lot of time needlessly looking things up in webster's.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4067#msg4067re:  [allmet33]        about how cr groups cars... the genesis is grouped with the '$30-45,000' cars.	1
	that grouping includes cars i think most would agree are not luxury cars, e.g.	1
	avalon, passat, maxima, azera, amanti, legacy, saab 9-3, charger v8, and grand marquis.	1
	otoh, it also includes the likes of:                                infiniti g35                lexus es and is                acura tl                cadillac cts                bmw 3-series                mb c class                lincoln mkz                                and of course now the genesis.	1
	cr groups cars for comparison based on price.	1
	not whether they are 'luxury' cars or not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4068#msg4068re:  [captain2]         tell them you spent 15 or 20 grand less than that on a hyundai then they think you should be committed.	1
	the people who would tell me that would not be my friends or people i respect, so i wouldn't care about their opinion anyway.	1
	now, if those folks want to make up the difference in price for me so that i can have a 'real' luxury car experience that they won't turn up their noses at, great, i'll take their money.	1
	otherwise it's none of their business what i choose to drive, just as it's none of my business what they choose to drive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4069#msg4069re:  [captain2]         dictionary definitions mean little in the world of perceptions.	1
	ahhhhh, but without a clear cut definition of the word...you wouldn't know where to begin.	1
	the definition is the foundation upon which the perception is built my friend.	1
	now you jump from using the 1-series as your example and jump up to talking about bmw's costing $50k plus.	1
	make up your mind!	1
	i'll give you this much, a neighbor may question why you paid $40k for a hyundai...until they actually get in it and either drive it or get a ride in it.	1
	then they'll be more like, 'wow...you got all that for $40k!!!'	1
	obviously with the sales of the genesis keeping up with mid-level premium brand entries, one wouldn't think purchasing one would equate to being committed.	1
	there have been plenty that have questioned it...that is until they actually go and sit in a genesis and take it for a ride.	1
	there are postings in the genesis review section on edmunds where folks initially didn't have the genesis on their list until someone told them they need to check it out and some even end up purchasing one even though it wasn't their initial target.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4070#msg4070re:  [backy]        thank you backy...that's exactly the point i was making to the captain.	1
	i'm starting to think he works with some sort of media outlet because he's taking a little bit of information he finds and twists it to suit his argument!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4071#msg4071re:  [backy]         the people who would tell me that would not be my friends or people i respect, so i wouldn't care about their opinion anyway.	1
	it might surprise you (and allmet) to know that i happen to agree with you - but i think you'll admit that for a majority of the autobuyers out there - hyundai doesn't make cars as expensive (or as good) as the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4072#msg4072re:  [captain2]        well...based on your postings, i would find it very hard to believe that you actually agree.	1
	hyundai doesn't make cars as expensive (or as good) as the genesis.	1
	well...they do and that is why people change their mind when they actually take the time to get in a genesis and see what it's all about.	1
	i can't tell you how many times i get into car conversations from those that don't even own a hyundai vehicle of any kind and they are quick to say, 'have you seen that new hyundai....the genesis!'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4073#msg4073re:  [allmet33]        everyone who has riden my genesis stated that if the hyundai badges were removed they would swear that the car was a bmw.	1
	a few of my friends though the car was a lexus.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4074#msg4074re:  [cviz821]        again...a point i'm trying to make to the captain.	1
	if they hadn't taken that ride in your genesis, they would probably think otherwise.	1
	the captain makes all his contentions based on his idea of what hyundai is and what he reads in various publications.	1
	he has yet to actually get in a genesis and take a spin.	1
	that is why he can't understand why my contention is that the genesis is a luxury sedan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4075#msg4075hyundai really came thru for me!!!	1

	luxury deals with comfort and prestige deals with public perception.	1
	i'd admit that hyundai is not a prestigious name as of yet.	1
	as a car, though, the genesis would belong in the category of luxurious.       	1

	however, that's the thing that's killing captain.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4083#msg4083consumer reports rates hyundai genesis top-rated upscale sedan        hyundai genesis outscores competitors, becomes consumer reports' top-rated 'upscale sedan'                                genesis narrowly outpoints lexus es 350 to take top spot                                yonkers, ny - the hyundai genesis outscored four competitors to become consumer reports top-rated vehicle in the competitive 'upscale sedan' category.	1
	the genesis, which achieved an 'excellent' overall road test score, now outranks 12 vehicles from lexus, acura, lincoln and others including the lexus es 350.                                the genesis' performance in cr's battery of tests solidifies the automaker's reputation as a builder of high-quality vehicles in several diverse automotive segments.	1
	previously, consumer reports named two hyundais, the elantra and santa fe, as 'top pick' vehicles in the small sedan and midsize suv categories respectively.	1
	'the hyundai genesis rivals high-end luxury sedans but costs considerably less,' said david champion, senior director of consumer reports' auto test center in east haddam, connecticut.	1
	'its luxurious and spacious interior and quietness far transcend its relatively modest price.'	1
	the genesis was tested against four other new or redesigned upscale sedansthe acura tl, nissan maxima, pontiac g8 and lincoln mks-for the february issue of consumer reports.	1
	prices ranged from $33,660 for the pontiac to $40,880 for the lincoln.	1
	two other vehicles in the test group also earned excellent overall road test scores, the tl and maxima.	1
	the g8 and mks achieved very good overall scores.	1
	the eight other vehicles in the upscale sedans category including the es 350, toyota avalon, buick lucerne and saab 9-5, were all tested previously.	1
	in addition to the five upscale sedans tested, cr also purchased and tested the jaguar xf luxury sedan.	1
	though it obtained a very good overall score, it still ranked near the bottom of the group of 12 luxury sedans that consumer reports has rated.	1
	but the redesigned honda pilot has slipped from being one of consumer reports' top-rated three-row suvs to midpack.	1
	the pilot now ranks eleventh out of seventeen midsized, three-row suvs that have been tested by cr.	1
	full tests and ratings of all six sedans appear in the february issue of consumer reports, which goes on sale january 6. the reports are also available to subscribers of www.consumerreports.org.	1
	(road test vehicles of recently tested vehicles are also available free at cr's web site.)	1
	the issue also contains a report on the conversion of a hybrid toyota prius to a plug-in hybrid.	1
	consumer reports chose a hymotion l5 conversion kit sold by a123 systems, which the company claims can yield more than 100 mpg.	1
	fuel economy in cr's converted prius jumped from 42 to 67 mpg overall for the first 35 miles of driving.	1
	at almost $11,000, the plug-in conversion clearly won't save consumers money overall.	1
	however, the technology itself proved viable.	1
	the tl is the only vehicle in this month's test group that is recommended by consumer reports.	1
	cr only recommends vehicles that have performed well in its tests, have at least average predicted reliability based on cr's annual car reliability survey of its more than seven million print and web subscribers, and performed at least adequately if crash-tested or included in a government rollover test.	1
	cr doesn't have reliability data yet on the genesis, mks, maxima, g8 and xf.	1
	spacious and well appointed, the rear-wheel-drive genesis offers good value and is a compelling alternative to luxury vehicles costing thousands more.	1
	this car's forte is swaddling passengers in silence.	1
	the engine sounds polished and road noise is strikingly absent.	1
	the interior rivals those of the very best luxury cars, with its optional stitched-leather dashboard facing and consistently high-quality materials.	1
	the only real drawback is its ride, which can be unsettled at times and doesn't live up to the standards set by other luxury cars.	1
	the genesis 3.8 ($36,000 manufacturer's suggested retail price as tested) is powered by a 290-hp, 3.8-liter v6 that feels quick and smooth and delivers a decent 21 mpg in cr's own fuel-economy tests.	1
	the six-speed automatic transmission provides smooth, quick shifts.	1
	braking is excellent.	1
	the redesigned acura tl is a nice car, with responsive handling, a slick powertrain and commendable fuel economy.	1
	but when compared with the previous tl, which was cr's top pick in this segment for years, the latest generation is not as impressive.	1
	vague steering saps the fun out of its handling, the trunk opening is small, and other competitors have roomier rear seats.	1
	the base-model tl ($35,715 msrp as tested) is powered by a 280-hp, 3.5-liter v6 that delivers excellent acceleration and a respectable 23 mpg overall on premium fuel.	1
	the five-speed automatic transmission is both quick and smooth.	1
	brakes are excellent overall.	1
	the maxima is a quick car, but it doesn't add much over the less costly nissan altima overall.	1
	while it's pleasant, it falls short in some ways.	1
	handling is responsive, but at low speeds the steering is overly light.	1
	the car is quiet and the ride is decent.	1
	but the new coupe-like silhouette compromises visibility, trunk room, and rear-seat comfort.	1
	the maxima 3.5 sv ($33,700 msrp as tested) is powered by a 290-hp, 3.5-liter v6 that gives the car quicker acceleration than some v8s.	1
	expect 22 mpg overall on premium fuel.	1
	the continuously variable transmission works very well overall; it's also the only one available.	1
	the maxima's brakes are very good overall.	1
	as a bargain sports sedan that can challenge the performance of models from bmw and mercedes, pontiac's g8 is a success.	1
	it handles and rides as well as the best cards in its class.	1
	the g8 gt's acceleration is very impressive, with a zero-to-sixty time of 5.7-seconds.	1
	but the downside of that is poor fuel economy-at just 17 mpg overall on regular fuel.	1
	the g8 gt ($33,660 msrp as tested) is powered by a huge 361-hp, 6.0-liter v8 engine that makes it blisteringly quick.	1
	the smooth six speed automatic transmission with a tall sixth gear makes highway cruising relaxed.	1
	the brakes are very good overall.	1
	(a 256-hp, 3.6-liter v6 with a five-speed automatic is also available in the base g8, but cr didn't test it because a more powerful v6 with a six-speed automatic will arrive in 2010.)	1
	in the tradition of large domestic luxury cars, lincoln's mks is built for pampering, not for spirited driving.	1
	handling lacks agility, and the engine is too noisy for a car in this class.	1
	the interior amenities and finishes are pleasant, but the mks feels too much like the ford taurus, on which it is based, to justify its luxury price tag.	1
	the mks ($40,880 msrp as tested) is equipped with a 273-hp, 3.7-liter v6 engine that performs well, but is not as quick or smooth as its competition in this class.	1
	cr measured its fuel economy at just 20 mpg overall on regular, which is not impressive.	1
	the six-speed automatic transmission is not as slick as most in this class.	1
	brakes are very good overall.       	1

	don't quote me on that though as i'm not 100% sure on that.	1
	the cts-v is also quite nasty considering it edged out the m5...which is actually a feat if you think about the fact it was an american car that did it.	1
	if you want a 535 for less and not used, best to buy at the end of the year and get the previous year model as they are trying to make room for the incoming new models.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4092#msg4092re: low volume [gmpatriot]        let's see - quite a few - the problem is balancing everything i want into one car  and not spending too much and not increasing my carbon footprint and do better than my 2006 is 350 - not easy.	1
	bmw 535/550/335/335d and the supercharged jaguar xk are at the top of my list.	1
	what would be great is if i had a 6 car garage and the $$$ to support my passion.	1
	i'd stock it with one of the two above, an aston martin vantage, an audi r8, a honda civic si 4-door, and a smart.	1
	if you counted 5 cars you're right - i left a space for one car for my honey.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4093#msg4093re: low volume [gmpatriot]         what cars do you fund attractive?	1
	maybe, just maybe i can answer this one without allmet's help.	1
	cars that are physically attractive, and those that are attractive in a mechanical sense are often not the same.	1
	the g8 has a lot going for it mechanically, but still suffers from  that traditional pontiac plasticked up boy racer treatment, my avalon is butt ugly, but i regard the mechanical specs and the interior egronomics as among the best, the genesis has both although i could live without the 'in your face' winged grill.	1
	chrysler for many years has generally made good looking cars imo - with lousy mechanics.	1
	jaguars look good but with substandard mechanics considering the price, the german cars are all usually appealing to me and have mechanical virtues mostly beyond reproach - if only i could justify spending that kind of money on one.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4094#msg4094re: low volume [captain2]        captain...you can't even take a simple question and answer it without a whole bunch of drama.	1
	my ultimate car of appeal to me...porsche 911 gt2!!!	1
	whew!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4095#msg4095re: low volume [allmet33]        what drama?	1
	my ultimate might just be the gt-r but not because it is especially pretty.	1
	mechanical sophistication and abilities definitely take precedence over what something looks like.	1
	kinda like a good wife...        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4096#msg4096re: low volume [captain2]        to a degree i can agree with you on the wife comment.	1
	but...if someone came to you and said, you can have any car you would desire...what would that one car be?	1
	throw practical sensibilities out the door...what is one car that you truly feel passionate about?	1
	me...i've been a porsche lover since i was a kid.	1
	for the longest time, the 959 was a wet dream for me.	1
	now that i'm older (don't know about the mature part...lol), the 959 gave way to the 911 gt2.	1
	that is my unicorn because i'll never pony up $200k just to see what it feels like to go from 0-60 mph in under 4 secs.	1
	i can spend a mere fraction of that and take my family to cedar point amusement park and take a ride on the top thrill dragster and hit 120 mph in about 4 secs.	1
	okay, if i had to pick a car that was attractive to my practical sensibilities...i would take the genesis, of course!	1
	p.s.	1
	the gt-r isn't exactly ugly to be honest, it depends on who you talk to.	1
	i watched a segment on the speed channel (super cars exposed) and they had a gt-r on there.	1
	not only can it run with some exotics/super cars...it can carry itself as a daily driver too...sweet!       	1

	boring?	1
	maybe, butt ugly.	1
	no.	1

	it really destroyed the looks of the 7 series bmw imo.	1
	our avalons suffer from the same treatment which is what i specifically do not like (on any car ) - that said the car is probably not the paragon of space effiiciency that it is without it.	1
	a bit harsh, true        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4100#msg4100re: low volume [captain2]        considering the bangle treatment is not as pronounced on the avalon as it is on a 7-series, do you really think it takes away from interior/cargo space??	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4101#msg4101re: low volume [koury]        i really don't take his dislike of the genesis grille to be a swipe, he's just saying he doesn't care for it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4104#msg4104re: you folks should consider [harddrivet]        comparing the g8 to the genesis is like comparing apples to oranges in my opinion.	1
	the g8 was way below in overall score to the genesis.	1
	the genesis is not a sports car.	1
	here is a bit of the review from cr about the interiors of both vehicles:                                 inside the cabin                  the interior is more utilitarian than luxurious.	1
	there are lots of plastic mold lines and loose fits, and some sharp edges, but most materials are nice.	1
	overall, it doesn't quite feel cheap, just a little bland.	1
	this big sedan has generous space, with plenty of head, leg, and foot room.	1
	the steering wheel tilts and telescopes, but some complained that the nonadjustable shoulder anchor makes the safety belt uncomfortable.	1
	wide front seats are supportive, but adjusting them is a chore.	1
	the space between the seat and door is tight, so it's difficult to get to the power-cushion adjuster.	1
	the manual recline knob, mounted at the seatback's base, is a long reach back and is stiff to turn.	1
	wide front pillars block the view in corners, but low head restraints leave a clear view out of the large rear window.	1
	the rear seat is spacious, even for three adults.	1
	even with the low seat cushion, it's easy to get comfortable because there's plenty of leg room.	1
	getting into the seats is made more challenging by the low seats and roof, which requires some ducking.	1
	controls aren't complicated, but some are awkward.	1
	lots of switches you'd expect to find on the doors, such as the mirrors, locks, and windows, are between the seats.	1
	what looks like a tuning knob for the radio controls only menus, and the power button is separate.	1
	lens glare often obscures the gauges.	1
	cabin storage is modest.	1
	the g8's trunk is nicely finished, but the rear seats don't fold down.	1
	a trunk pass-through opens in the center seat to carry long cargo.	1
	the g8 does not come with a spare tire, just a can of sealant and an air compressor.	1
	inside the cabin                  the interior of the genesis rivals those of the very best luxury cars, with its optional stitched-leather dashboard facing and consistently high-quality materials.	1
	everything fits together well except for the loose overhead bluetooth control panel.	1
	there is plenty of room inside, easily accommodating even tall drivers.	1
	the optional power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel helps everyone get comfortable.	1
	the front seats are decent but don't have quite as much support as those in other luxury cars.	1
	large windows all around aid visibility and help make up for wide windshield pillars and large rear head restraints.	1
	the rear is as spacious as in luxury cars costing tens of thousands more.	1
	seat contours cradle occupants, armrests are perfectly placed, and the cushion offers plenty of support.	1
	access is very good; wide doors and tall roof make it easy.	1
	controls in our test car were very straightforward to use.	1
	radio and climate controls are large and mounted high on the dashboard.	1
	but opting for the navigation system forces you to use a multifunctional controller to navigate through frustrating onscreen menus for many simple tasks, such as tuning the radio.	1
	some climate-control buttons are difficult to tell apart, and the blue control lighting lacks contrast in some conditions.	1
	the radio display was way too bright at night, but at least it was easy to turn off.	1
	cabin storage is modest, with little open storage.	1
	a pass-through behind the center armrest opens to allow long items to fit in the trunk.	1
	but it doesn't lock, and the rear seats don't fold down.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4105#msg4105re: you folks should consider [mtnman1]        if you are looking for a luxury car, the g8 is probably not the car for you.       	1

	[vjkaty]        let me just say i never did find out what was wrong with that car but my (new) genesis drives like a dream and all the past problems are now a distant memory       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4107#msg4107battery drain problem resolved (i hope!)	1
	the technician at my dealer thinks he has resolved the battery drain problem i have been blogging about.	1
	after spending several days looking for the cause, the technician got in touch with hyundai's tech support (somewhere on the west coast).	1
	eventually, they found that the switch button under the hood was 'bent'.	1
	they then kept the car over the weekend and checked it with their meter which indicates that the abnormal drain no longer exists.	1
	i have not had an occasion to leave the car parked for more than two days but i am knocking on wood that it is fixed.	1
	i would like to acknowledge a post on december 27th by ricwhite that directed me to a couple of posts about this same problem on the azera and a hood button being the culprit.	1
	although my technician did not initially give it much credance, my genesis obviously turned out to have the same scenario as the azera problem (and fix).	1
	just my two cents but i think that this forum should stick to factual and useful dialogs rather than some idiot going on and on about how bad a car model (genesis) is that he has never even driven.	1
	you don't need to read many of his posts to realize what a distorted and miserable misfit he is.	1
	i think most of you know who i am referring to.	1
	thanks again to ricwhite and others who have provided informative dialogs.       	1

	but as the article states, winning doesn't always mean instant success.	1
	i for one am not too concerned about the genesis gaining a lot of sales.	1
	i just want them to sell enough that it will survive and that hyundai wants to invest money in it so that it'll be a better car in each iteration.	1
	i like the idea of having a car that stands out from the rest.	1
	and around where i live, bmw, benz and lexus vehicles are a dime a dozen.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4114#msg4114xj220...        let's review that again for good measure, except that it's not just where you live that bmw's, lexus', benz and even cadidillac's are a dime a dozen.	1
	not necessarily where i live in this dusty, se arizona cowtown i live in, but they're everywhere, those cars you mentioned.	1
	the genesis is a breath of fresh air from hyundai  compared to those other cars, and, so is the new genesis coupe, soon to come out.	1
	agreed, of course hyundai would appreciate high sales right away, but, realistically, if they get enough sales to rack up some saved investment money in rd for future productions of the genesis rwd luxo-sedan and coupe, that is truly a good thing for their future.	1
	and a nice thing for whomever wants to buy these particular rigs down the road apiece, too.        	1

	perhaps...                the genesis really had no competition (the vw jetta tdi, and the ford flex- 2nd and 3rd) but  at least the nacoty is based on some non 'subsidized' auto journalist opinions.	1
	what's really impressive?	1
	not something 'minor' like urban wheels and the limited choices that we had for the 2009my - but somebody not subsidized like cr rating it ordinally higher than a number of other really fine 'upscale' sedans (incl.	1
	hyundai's own azera)  and are priced similarily - or ftm statistics that show that the genesis is sitting on lots a comparatively short period of time before they are sold.	1
	'urban wheels'  award gimmee a break!	1
	why not just pay somebody we've heard of - like jdp - for some trumped up award like  'the highest initial quality and initial satisfaction for all sub $35k rwd boulevard cruisers  that come with leather interiors, standard zoned air conditioning, heated seats, 300 hp, have a computer 'mouse' and lots of other available doodads - or whatever?'	1

	an attitude like that will only serve to perpetuate hyundai's image problems - is there some reason that you think that hyundai shouldn't be able to produce a good car?	1
	of course they can - and they have - all it takes is a little commitment and some  deep pockets.	1
	the listing of your 2009 models really has limited choices if you are defining a 'car of the year' as something truly 'ground up' new which the genesis, of course, is and many of these other candidates aren't.	1
	what  vehicles on this list are not simple rebadges, simple updates, and/or 'crossovers' not really 'cars' at all.	1
	just the 1 series (maybe) and the gtr ?	1
	not at all that the genesis isn't deserving of many of the accolades it is getting, only that 2009 is and will be a bad year for cars, the genesis being one of the few available bright spots on a rather bleak horizon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4138#msg4138re: more car of the year [captain2]        so by winning the car of the year, your position is 'something truly 'ground up'' - and the genesis is, no doubt...but is that really how it usually work?	1
	let's have a look at the recent finalists from the past few years:                                2008 - malibu, cts, accord                2007 - aura, fit, camry                2006 - civic, fusion, solstice                                the first model listed in each year took home the award.	1
	you mean to tell me they were, and i quote 'something truly 'ground up''?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4139#msg4139re: service [sheltonzz]        with chewed wires, i'd bet on the rodents.	1
	squirrels normally nest up in trees.	1
	rat or mouse would be much more likely.	1
	the nest could have been there from your place or from time on the dealer's lot.	1
	10+ years ago i had a car where i found the bag of gumdrops i left on the front seat empty.	1

	of course not, but this only goes to illustrate how remarkable the genesis is in that regard.	1
	as i said, of that original listing of nominees you posted , and other than the rather unavailable gtr, there is not one of them that is truly 'new' or remarkable in a coty respect.	1
	if that is the competition, the 2009  genesis should 'win' every coty it is entered in, simply because of what it is, and what its competitors are not....       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4144#msg414415,000 mile update        i will roll over the 15,000 mile mark this week.	1
	i have been updating my impressions of my fully loaded v6 genesis at various intervals.	1
	first, let me get the one (big) problem that i have had out of the way.	1
	i am the one that had several posts related to a persistent battery drain problem that occurred every time i parked the car for more than three days.	1
	long story short ... it turned out to be a defective switch that gets depressed upon closing the hood.	1
	i assume that it turns various things on or off (engine compartment light, security system, etc.).	1
	the technician believes that was the problem and that it is fixed.	1
	ironically, i have not had an occasion to leave the car parked for more than two days since they achieved this 'fix'.	1
	in spite of my frustration with the problem described above, i am still a big fan of the genesis.	1
	it is not perfect (what car is?	1
	), but it does so many things well!	1
	in fact, if you go back to my previous updates, you will see below that i am becoming more impressed with the car as the miles roll by.	1
	here goes:                                1.  i still think the v6 comes close to matching the v8  genesis that i drove about six weeks ago.	1
	it has the same 0 to 60 of six seconds flat and the same 14.5 second quarter-mile time (per the march 2009 issue of car and driver).	1
	i was pleased to see that confirmation of my having suggested in one of my posts that the v6 appeared to hang with the v8 in any kind of normal driving.	1
	i keep repeating how well the six-speed transmission is mated with the v6 and how powerful the engine is for a v6.	1
	i have taken three trips over the steepest parts of the blue ridge and smokey mountains and this thing is so torquey that it never has to drop down to 5th gear to keep pace at 75 to 85 mph.	1
	also, the transmission shows no symptoms of 'gear hunting' like most six cylinders do on long, steep inclines to offset their lack of power and torque.	1
	i am convinced that hyundai's rating of 290 hp is purposely understated to keep buyers from thinking it is too close to the 375 hp v8 version.	1
	2.  i find myself liking the ride characteristics better all the time.	1
	i was initially fairly critical of how 'jiggly' it was over undulating road services and pavement seams.	1
	it is very stiff over speed bumps and rough pavement but out on the boulevard, it is a dream.	1
	3.  my fuel mileage remains good but somewhat inconsistent.	1
	never-the-less, it always achieves the epa rating of 27 on the highway.	1
	it usually gets a mile or two better than that but it sure does not like fuel containing ethanol.	1
	don't get me started on that crap again!	1
	4.  dare i repeat that i am still unhappy that hyundai has calibrated the speedometer to overstate the actual speed?	1
	are you listening hyundai?	1
	don't give me the old 'it is within tolerance' jargon!	1
	if you are going to boast about how much technology went into the genesis, don't act like it is acceptable to overstate the speed by as much as 5%.	1
	5.  i find it disappointing that the last two cars i owned had tire pressure monitors that gave readouts for each tire giving the psi for each.	1
	the genesis just tells you when one tire is low.	1
	6.  the lexicon is the absolute best audio system i have ever seen in an automobile.	1
	in summary, i am trying to give an objective review from my perspective.	1
	i hate the posts from those that are fanatical either way, some claiming the car is perfect, and some going on and on about what a piece of junk it is.	1
	it is neither ... but in balance, it is a very competitive luxury car that leans toward being sporty as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4145#msg4145response to colegar        thank you colegar, that is a very good review on your impressions of the vehicle and it means a lot from somebody who drives it on daily basis.	1
	curious on one note, i did think that the tpms does show you on the display which tire is low on air, meaning on the small lcd on the instrument cluster.	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4146#msg4146re: 15,000 mile update [colegar]        when the tpms comes on in any car, it's because there is something usually in the tread (nail, glass, screw, etc.).	1
	a tire will not 'seep' enough air for the tpms to come on.	1
	this being said, it's usually easy enough to spot the low tire, or if the tire isn't leaking (rapidly) the offending cause poking out of the tire.	1
	i have tpms in my 4runner as well, it doesn't tell me which tire, but i figure it has easily saved me from buying two tires that might have other wised been ruined had the light not come on (telling me i had a problem somewhere) and allowing me to safely pull over and inspect the tires.	1
	it doesn't seem it takes that long anymore to run a short distance on a flat tire and ruin it!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4147#msg4147re: response to colegar [dudest]        it depends on the car                my acura tells me the tire pressure of all 4 tires.	1

	i was impressed, however, with the review, and the following portions stood out:                                'the genesis profile also speaks                 premium                ....'

	well ... i am originally from the hills of arkansas so what did you expect???!	1

	i don't know how some of you feel, but a really good system is one that can make you 'see' the performers.	1
	what i mean is...if you're sitting in your car and you close your eyes...do you simply just hear the music or is it alive enough that you can picture the artist in front of you singing and the band backing the artist up.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4154#msg4154re: 15,000 mile update [chuck1]        that is definitely not true that when the tpms comes on it is because the tires have a nail or something in any car.	1
	i have a 2004 mountaineer and a 2009 fusion and mine will come on when the pressure is low which usually occurs when the temperature suddenly drops to the single digits for a couple of days.	1
	i will then take them to have them filled and will find that the pressure is down o 24 psi or something.	1
	only had the tpms on once in the mountaineer because of a nail.       	1

	my last car was also an acura tl and i checked the pressures shown on its diagram (using a digital guage) and found it to be very accurate.	1

	in meetings, and the voice-over says something like, 'it took a little thing like the north american car of the year award to get people to say our name right.'	1
	i thought it was a pretty funny way to get the point across.	1
	there was also an ad for the coupe, showing a yellow coupe being flung around a racetrack.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4158#msg4158re: response to colegar [colegar]        it has a direct monitoring system.	1
	the manual states: each wheel is equipped with a tire pressure sensor mounted inside the tire behind the valve stem.'	1
	my tpms light came on for a specific tire and i took it in.	1
	the dealer hooked the computer up to the car and the car reported the psi for each tire.	1
	(so it knows the psi, unfortunately it doesn't show the number on the dash, only the tires that are too low)  also all my tires were below 33, but only one was low enough to trigger the warning, so i can understand why it would be nice to know the exact psi.       	1

	illiustrates the influence of individual perspective and predisposition, i guess.	1
	at least according to an espn talk show this morning (i don't know whose 'ratings' they (mike and mike) were talking about) , the hyundai ads you reference rated at the bottom of all the super bowl ads - the doritos ads at the top of the heap - at least in terms of 'funny'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4160#msg4160re: super bowl ad [captain2]        i guess if one considers ripping the clothes off a young lady as she is walking down the street or turning a police officer into a monkey funny.	1
	i think it's pretty juvenile.	1
	could be an indication of the market that the doritos ads were going after.	1
	maybe a better word for the hyundai ad is 'clever.'	1
	it wasn't rip-roaring funny, more tongue-in-cheek funny.	1

	yes, i drive 30k miles per year and i am a fanatic about keeping tires inflated properly.	1
	i really liked being able to see the readout diagram on my previous car (acura tl).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4162#msg41622010 v6 genesis sedan        has anyone heard of any small changes/upgrades planned for the 2010 v6 genesis sedan?	1
	in addition to fixing any reported bugs in the 2009 model, a small horsepower bump up for the 3.8 would be nice.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4163#msg4163re: 2010 v6 genesis sedan [bman900]        'the 2010 hyundai genesis sedan should see no major changes following its introduction for the 2009 model year.	1
	hyundai's largest car offers two engines: a 290-hp 3.8-liter v6 for the 3.8; and a 375-hp 4.6-liter v8 for the 4.6. a new base model with a 3.3-liter v6 may join the sedan lineup sometime in the model year.'	1
	http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2010-hyundai-genesis.htm                                my personal opinion (and wish) is that the lambda rs engine developed for the genesis coupe would be further massaged (turbocharging or direct-injecting) and a                 v6 genesis sedan rs                version made available (the target powerplant may be the new z's 332 hp v6).	1
	the reasons why i think this may be done: 1) the v6 genesis offers a better f/r weight ratio, and any suspension tuning will be more readily reflected in the car's handling characteristics; and 2) other notable manufacturers are focusing on bumping up their smaller engines (bmw's upcoming m5 will have a turbo v-8 rather than a v-10).	1
	btw, i thought the lambda rs engine's output was 303-306 hp; the article below indicates 310 - is this due only to using premium fuel, or hyundai's reaction to the new mustang (315-hp 4.6-liter v8)?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4164#msg4164re: 2010 v6 genesis sedan [dean3927]        personally, i kinda figured there wouldn't be any major changes with the sophomore iteration of the genesis.	1
	there may be some tweaks here and there, but why mess with something that seems to be a pretty successful package already, right?	1
	as far as the massaging of the powerplant...don't hold your breath.	1
	i think that is the main reason that hyundai has already made the genesis coupe available to the aftermarket houses to create bolt on parts for the coupe.	1
	the 4 cyl.	1
	model will likely see more aftermarket pieces than the v-6 version, but i'm sure a super/turbo charger of some sort will be available for the v-6.	1
	as far as hp numbers go, it could very well be the numbers based on premium fuel.	1
	the 303 hp figure will most likely be what the output is using regular with a nice little boost with premium.	1
	the genesis sedan 3.8 puts out 368 hp using regular and 375 hp on premium.       	1

	at its core, this top-line genesis se coupe is powered by hyundai's 24-valve, 3.8-liter lambda v6, which produces 299 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and delivers 266 pound-feet of torque at 4,700 rpm.	1

	yes - for all it's greatness, the genesis suffers from some suspension issues that are very well documented and discussed over at the hyundai genesis owners forum (i strongly suggest any owner to monitor that site).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4181#msg4181re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [californiadan]        i have to echo these complaints about the harsh ride.	1
	unfortunately, the roads in our test ride didn't disclose this shortcoming.	1
	after owning the car 2 weeks, we took a 1300 mile trip to s. ca which got us on some major roads w/bumps  potholes  made us realize the harsh ride problem.	1
	the rough ride home back to the bay area on i-5 w/its many potholes, caused my sciatica to become a problem for the 1st time in many yrs.	1
	after searching the internet for solutions (sans luck), i took it to my 30+ yr tire dealer  asked what he might be able to do.	1
	he said he could put on his softest tire,  drop the tire pressure a few psi,  said i probably wouldn't be able to discern any difference.	1
	the dealer, nor their regional service tech or sales mgr were aware of any fixes.	1
	to avoid further problems w/my sciatica, we took the car to the dealer to sell on consignment.	1
	it's been a huge disappointment to us because i've been following this car since it was 1st announced,  we were anxious to get 1 when it arrived.	1
	it is such a great car in about every respect.	1
	i've read that when the genesis was introduced in korea, it had adjustable air suspension (air bags which you could change pressure), but they wanted a different suspension for the american mkt.	1
	my current car is a 1998 740i which is great for our many trips to s. ca to see family  friends,  i was hoping to replace it w/the genesis.        	1

	who knows, you may not find the same isssues that some have mentioned.	1
	i know when i tested a 3.8 w/premium package...the seats were very supportive and comfortable and the ride was quite compliant over all surfaces during city driving (speeds only up to 45).	1
	i didn't get a chance to take it on the highway to see what it would do at highway speeds.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4188#msg4188re:  [johnxyz]        based on my impressions of the genesis, i thought the suspsension was fine, not too firm and not too soft, and the seats were far from subpar.	1
	take the advice from allmet, and go drive one.	1
	i also don't know if you can find a car from toyota or honda on the same level as the genesis, assuming lexus is excluded (i skipped acura on purpose                ).       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4200#msg4200re: oil change intervals [joejet]        from my understanding, the newer sonatas are getting synthetic oil from the dealer.	1
	that being said...you can go 7500 easily between oil changes.	1
	however, there are a great many that follow the practice of doing the first oil change at 3000 miles (if not sooner) to get rid of any break-in debris from the oil.	1
	personally, i change my own oil (i own an azera) with castrol syntec and i follow the 7500 mile schedule (for the most part).	1
	doing it yourself will not void the warranty.	1

	there will be some that will say no, wait till the 7500 miles, some will say yes.	1

	it's funny how you talk about all the complaints, but if you look at the customer review section in edmunds in regards to the genesis....it has a customer rating of 9.4.  does that reflect every owner out there, no...it does not.	1
	just as the site you mention with the complaints doesn't reflect all the genesis owners out there either.	1
	if the problem were as drastic as you make it out to be, then why hasn't it made the news yet?	1
	remember when the small suv's had the problem of tipping easily, it made the news quickly since it was a safety hazard (to say the least).	1
	i would think this would qualify as such if it were indeed as horrific as you make it out to be.	1
	lastly, how do you really think anyone can go and check how many genesis have been returned, traded in or gotten rid of simply because of this 'suspension issue'?	1
	i hate to say it, you're starting to sound like this other guy in another forum by the name of snaglepus.	1

	while i was out there, i watched a guy in his 50's / early-60's return from test driving a silver genesis 4.6 with his wife.	1
	he was a conservative, dignified looking man, and reminded me of someone i'd see driving a lexus.	1
	as they were getting out of the car they had just test-driven, the man said to his salesman enthusiastically, 'yep, i want this one.'	1
	i've noticed the dealer's genesis inventory has been steadily increasing, and the cars are moving.	1
	they started out with 3 models, all v6's.	1
	then they got a v8.	1
	this past weekend, they had 8 genesis models on the lot.	1
	two v8's and six v6's.	1
	i guess people who are interested in buying a genesis actually go test drive them despite all the negative posts by alleged owners on the internet.	1
	btw, many of the roads in the area look as though they haven't been resurfaced in years.	1
	plenty of bumps/ridges/potholes to bring out the worst in any suspension.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4211#msg4211re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [stanco]        stanco, i do own a genesis and i believe after 16,500 miles i am among those qualified to post an informed response to your serious charges regarding the suspension.	1
	if you go back to my original post and work forward, you will see that i have had a some criticism of the stiff ride on bumpy roads, but you will also see that i have complimented other traits of the suspension, and, in fact, have grown to respect the overall performance of the car.	1
	i am a relatively spirited driver and i have had the car on all sorts of roads.	1
	i can absolutely assure you that i have never had any symptom of anything approaching the dangerous and violent suspension behavior you so persistently describe.	1
	although your story is difficult for most of us to square, you have the right to believe that it is accurate and factual.	1
	however, it is so far from my 16,500 mile experience that i can't begin to get myself to be concerned that i will dive into a corner and the car will go crazy out of control.	1
	i know that i am being blunt but your post wasn't exactly soft peddled.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4213#msg4213re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        it's funny how you talk about all the complaints, but if you look at the customer review section in edmunds in regards to the genesis....it has a customer rating of 9.4. does that reflect every owner out there, no...it does not.	1
	just as the site you mention with the complaints doesn't reflect all the genesis owners out there either. '	1
	allmet... you hit the proverbial nail on the head....the 'other site' has over 1100 members and the posts about the suspension come, over and over again, from fewer than 10...or roughly 1% of the members.	1
	not to say they are not entitled to their opinions.	1
	rating a suspension is subjective, depends on what you have been used to and what it is you prefer: firm, not so firm, soft etc.	1
	but claims about the genesis suspension being dangerous, out of control, etc are just so far over the top they can't be taken seriously.	1
	so don't.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4214#msg4214re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [stanco]        i'm still with stanco on this.	1
	even if i discount 50% of what he is referencing there are now too many doubts.	1
	where there is smoke, there is fire...                                throw in hyundai ignoring the complaints ( but then again what car company doesn't...) and i'll have to pay more for a japanese brand, which i suppose buys some peace of mind (and resale).	1
	appears that hyundai was dodging customer issues with the azera (sp?)	1
	model that preceded the genesis.	1
	e're not talking about $25 dollars here.	1
	thethe crummy seats in a $40,000 hyundai (v8 model) has a point about perceived quality and value.	1
	i may still go look at one just to address my curiosity.	1
	though.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4215#msg4215re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [johnxyz]        i would like to understand better what hyundai's response to these complaints has been, i.e.	1
	have they actually been 'ignoring' them or is their response not what those complaining wanted?	1
	for example:  owner tells hma that the genesis' suspension is 'defective' and 'unsafe' (words used in this thread).	1
	hyundai checks the car, finds that the suspension is working as designed, tells the owner that.	1
	what more is hma to do at this point?	1
	sure, they can decide to change the suspension design at some point to make the ride over bumps smoother, if enough owners and prospective buyers think the ride is too stiff.	1
	but that is likely to be impractical to do on existing cars.	1
	i have a feeling what these owners posting here would like hma to do is to buy their cars back at the price they paid (maybe less mileage?).	1
	i can understand why someone would want the manufacturer to do that.	1
	but i can also understand if hma doesn't do that, if the suspension is performing as designed.	1
	if a dealer or hma in general decided to buy back cars because the owners don't like them, i would see that as a very generous customer service gesture.	1
	but not something that they should be expected to do.	1
	as has been noted, it would be more effective for owners to take their case up the chain at hma, all the way to the president if necessary, rather than slamming hyundai here.	1
	there is also an arbitration process that is spelled out in the owner's manual.	1
	and if the owner believes the car is unsafe, a good course of action would be to file a complaint with the nhtsa.	1
	they can open an investigation that could lead to a recall--if in fact there is a safety issue with the car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4216#msg4216re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [johnxyz]        like i said before, do yourself a favor and go test drive one yourself.	1
	nothing can replace personal experience.	1
	as far as hyundai not responding.	1
	let's see if i can put this in perspective.	1
	you design a car that you've rd'd to the nines, you release it and all the critics (auto authorities) test it and give it really good reviews in regards to suspension performance (note i did not say outstanding).	1
	then, the car wins north american car of the year.	1
	out of nowhere, you get a single owner approaching you talking about how dangerous the car is, that over uneven surfaces at highway speeds, the steering wheel jerks violently out of his hands.	1
	are you seriously going to pay this guy any attention???	1
	now, if you started having folks from all over the country coming at you with the same complaint, then you start taking a look at what is going on.	1
	so far, you are the only person i've ever seen describe your suspension experience with so much dramatic flair.	1
	i honestly don't have an issue with you having a problem with the suspension, i can accept that it may not be what you were expecting, but dude...seriously...tone down the dramatics and everyone will take you a little more seriously.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4217#msg4217re:  [johnxyz]        precisely, as i felt the bumpy ride myself... nice car but the 2009 maxima is much nicer especially in the exterior design in my opinion... i have test driven the 2009 maxima and i am considering it very cautiously as a many years toyota owner...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4218#msg4218re:  [agnosto]        the maxima is indeed a very nice car and the much needed design change it so deserved, but honestly...not as much car as the genesis is.	1
	i'm surprised you're not cross shopping the m35 as it's comparable in many ways with the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4219#msg4219re:  [allmet33]        it might surprise you but i still like the looks, body flares of the 2009 maxima better than m35... maybe the g37 (which i might test drive only the g37 sedan but still i like the looks of 09 maxima better), also in my psychology i do not consider any vehicle no matter how good it is above $45k... another factor is always reliabilty which as a current toyota owner (18+ years free of any major issue(s) except minor ones) makes it very difficult to decide...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4220#msg4220anyone researched the genesis ride problem?	1
	i've heard the korean version of the genesis has a better ride than the us spec version.	1
	without going into the air suspension option in korea, does anyone know the coil spring rate/dimensions of the korean vs. us version of the genesis?	1
	what about any differences in shock valving?	1
	are the korean springs and shocks interchangeable with the us version?	1
	i would try to get hyundai to change out the parts for those who want a softer ride.	1
	if enough owners and potential owners complain, hyundai just might do something.	1
	changing tires might also improve the ride.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4221#msg4221re:  [agnosto]        actually, it doesn't surprise me at all.	1
	the maxima does have beautiful lines.	1
	the only reason i mentioned the m35 was it's a car that is pretty close to the size of the genesis, moreso than the maxima.	1
	if the maxima is your thing, then you're in a whole different class of car and the door is much wider now.	1
	g37, es, c-class, 3-series...just to name few.	1
	heck you wanna take a look at a beautiful car that i think trumps the maxima...try the passat cc!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4222#msg4222hyundai genesis steering problem needs to be addressed        purchased new 09 genesis 4.6 with tech package.	1
	very nice car with no complaints except for the steering pull when driving on freeways/roads with sloped surfaces.	1
	because of the heavy steering, it can requirer two hands on the steering wheel to counter sloped driving surfaces.	1
	on short test drives, you probably won't  experience this to you have a few hundred miles of driving experience.	1
	for a first year car, hyundai did a great job, but needs to correct this steering pull   issue.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4223#msg4223re: hyundai genesis steering problem needs to be addressed [bmichael]        considering the genesis is rwd, there should be no pull on the steering wheel unless the alignment is out of whack or the air pressure in your tires is very uneven.	1
	i would have them check that out.	1
	fwd cars usually have the issue with torque steer, but usually only during acceleration.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4224#msg4224re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [johnxyz]        i have the 4.6 and  i find ride is great!	1
	on certain rough roads the suspension gets a little busy, however my lexus is was positively worse and it's ride over imperfections in the road was very harsh.	1
	that's why i got rid of it in favor of the genesis.	1
	one could check the ride in another car to see if there is much of a difference to determine if the car has a problem.	1
	all in all the tire profile gives me a superior ride and handles and tracks well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4225#msg4225re:  [allmet33]        oh no, not for me, as i went to take a look at the passat cc last week and left as fast as i could from the dealership, as i could not stand it ... as i said i am very particular with the exterior of a vehicle to attract me right at the first sight...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4226#msg4226re:  [agnosto]        to each their own my friend.	1
	i just don't understand how you say the m35 isn't curvaceous enough for you and yet, the lines are very similar to the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4227#msg4227re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]         'i hate to say it, you're starting to sound like this other guy in another forum by the name of snaglepus.	1
	he swears up and down that every single azera on the road has the same suspension issue his does, but since everybody isn't complaining about it, then we are either too ignorant to know better or we are in denial.'	1
	mike, you say 'i hate to say it' .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	but then you go ahead and do say it!	1
	if you are going to quote someone, be factual and not try and put words in that persons' mouth.	1
	first place, he does not swear anything.	1
	you think that your 20 inch wheels and lousy riding low profile tires are the way to go says something about your approach to cars.	1
	same thing can be said about all the monies that you have wasted on radio equipment on your azera.	1
	.	1
	. '	1
	we are either too ignorant to know better or we are in denial                .'	1
	remember, you said it, not his words but yours.	1
	what does what snaglepus says on another forum have to do with this genesis discussion?	1
	some people simply love to hear themselves talk.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4228#msg4228re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [donna388]        hey donna...hating to say something doesn't mean that it isn't going to be said.	1
	also, i didn't quote anyone, i simply gave a summary.	1
	by me saying he 'swears', that's not meant in the literal sense, but if you see the conviction with which he states nobody knows what they are talking about, you may as well say he swears it.	1
	now....as far as my 20's and low profile tires...it was my choice.	1
	however, until you've had a ride in it...you can hardly say it's lousy riding.	1
	putting them on wasn't about my 'approach' to cars.	1
	it just means i wish for my azera to stand out from all the other...you know, personal touch!	1
	my audio system, the money would only be 'wasted' if it wasn't an upgrade and sounded like crap.	1
	now...as far as what snags said, all i said is that one guy sounded like the other...simply put.	1
	basically just making an observation.	1
	some people simply love to hear themselves talk.	1
	based on the fact that your response to my posting has nothing to do with the genesis discussion, you're the pot calling the kettle black!	1
	p.s.	1
	oh...and my posting you responded to, did have relevance to the genesis topic.	1
	thank you very much!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4229#msg4229re: hyundai genesis steering problem needs to be addressed [bmichael]        have to agree here - when i'm in the left lane on the highway, i do find the car tends to drift left due to the crown of the road, and a slight amount of correction needs to be applied.	1
	i never experienced this in my previous car.	1
	same goes when in the right lane (except reverse).	1
	and of course when in the middle lane, straight as an arrow.	1
	there is a lengthy discussion of this in the hyundai owner's forum.	1
	i would not let this discourage anyone from buying this car though.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4230#msg4230re: people looking at / buying genesis [aqua33v6]        hi all.	1
	speaking as someone who purchased a genesis about two weeks ago and am trading it in this weekend for something/anything else i can attest that concerns about the ride/suspension are real.	1
	this does not mean that they are necessarily widesprerad or experienced by everyone in the same manner or at all  many report no concerns about the ride and are happy.	1
	others report concern.	1
	this does not negate the validity of either experience.	1
	indeed, i have experienced both extremes myself - the demo i drove was firm, maybe a tad harsh, but acceptable - especially given all else wonderful about the car.	1
	the car i ended with, however, has the worst ride of any car i have ever driven - there is not a single type of road on which the ride is acceptable let alone pleasant.	1
	having driven many cars and models in the last month (acura, lexus, lincoln, bmw, toyota, honda, sonata, sante fe, etc.)	1
	on the same roads i can say the genesis is by far the worst ride of any.	1
	it is best described as nervous, pitchy or bouncy - every bump,swell and road imperfection, no matter how minor, is felt and pitches the car.	1
	on a so-so highway near me it feels as if one is riding a go-kart with the car almost seeming to skip along the surface and shaking you around quite unpleasantly.	1
	indeed, my sante fe and every other car i have ever tested handles this same stretch with minimal or no bounce whatsoever.	1
	i have also experienced the 'porpoising' daily on two stretches of road in the area.	1
	i can say that the issue goes beyond just mere preference for a firm vs. soft ride to some downright odd and, yes, at times scary behavior.	1
	again, in 30 years i have never had any other car ever exhibit anything like the constantly harsh, jittery ride of my genesis.	1
	i emphasize my genesis.	1
	i can't vouch for anyone else and don't deny that many people love the ride and have no concerns.	1
	some wish to deny, however, that this issue exists.	1
	others who love their ride, of course, think i am nuts, lying, work for lexus, deluded, ignorant, etc.	1
	none of those are true.	1
	there are others like myself who have experienced the same or similar behavior - many of whom have contacted me.	1
	several have or are trading in for something else as hyundai has to date denied any sort of issue.	1
	it is always best to drive the car for yourself and make your own decision - i would only caution you to make sure you extensively drive the specific vehicle you will purchase over every road surface you typically encounter.	1
	through a process of elimination i have also discovered that in my car the ride is much better when it's rainy out.	1
	so i'd suggest your drive when it's dry.	1
	i did my extensive test in a demo on a very rainy afternoon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4231#msg4231re: people looking at / buying genesis [johnnw]        this may be a silly question, since either you or your dealership may have done so already, but have you checked your tire pressure?	1
	hyundai ships their vehicles with very overly inflated tire pressure to prevent flat spotting.	1
	from what i have read in these forums, many dealerships miss correcting the pressure during vehicle prep.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4232#msg4232re: people looking at / buying genesis [ergsum]        it's not tire pressure.	1
	all that and more has been done.	1
	sand in back, psi adjusted, endless meetings with regional reps, techs, manager, etc.	1
	all to no avail.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4233#msg4233re: people looking at / buying genesis [johnnw]        i was not pleased to hear i have a twin.	1
	as you know i have suffered with a duplicate defective suspension along with being nuts, delusionary etc.	1
	after receiving constant degrading from the fabulous 5  'know it alls',spearheaded by allnet33,backy, captain,joe97,bfriended and koury.	1
	there has been no response from letters to hyundai's bosses and the dealer had                a jerk who i met at the dealer who didn't drive the car but left a message 'car is normal' and case is closed !	1
	had he at least put it on a lift  i wouldn't be livid.	1
	also i found same color overspray on windshield, side windows, rear window all on right side.	1
	they said may have been dockside touch up but no records exist.	1
	i had to clean it myself.	1
	after owning over 40 cars i must say, this is the worst experience ever, including                seeking advice on this hyundai/edmunds blog.	1
	thank you for confirmation, but sorry for your experience.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4234#msg4234re: people looking at / buying genesis [stanco]        i am sorry you took a constructive suggestion to report your issue to the nhtsa as 'degrading.'	1
	btw... have you done that yet?	1
	if so, what were the results?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4235#msg4235genesis tires        i visited tirerack.com to read reviews of the dunlop sp sport 5000 m tire, the tire used on all genesis models with both 17' and 18' wheels.	1
	i found many negative reviews on this tire, notably from is250 and ls430 owers.	1
	curiously, most of the negative reviews from people driving those lexus models were from early-2008 and prior, before the genesis was even road tested or released on the market.	1
	one ls430 driver commented:                                'on smooth surface (blacktop) roads very quite on concrete or different type surface you can hear the tire noises.	1
	if air pressure is to high in tire you have a hard road ride.	1
	and a couple other ls430 drivers wrote:                                'the car is 'cushy' on low speed, but once you are on highway doing over 60mph, it is noisy and takes slightest roughness on the road hard.	1
	i dont like it.'	1
	'...the reason i bought the car was for a soft quiet ride.	1
	this tire does not excel in these areas.	1
	i have owned tires half the price of these dunlops that ride better with less noise.	1
	will replace with another brand in about 5000 miles.'	1
	all of the above reviews were from people using the same model dunlop tire that is used on all genesis models.	1
	so, was hyundai hoping that most genesis buyers would prefer grip over ride comfort?	1
	should these dunlop tires be dropped down to 28 or 30 psi in order provide a smoother ride?	1
	i think it's possible that there may have been a little misjudgment on hyundai's part when they chose to put these tires on the genesis.	1
	or, maybe it's as simple as hyundai creating a future tsb to drop the tire pressure when owners complain of a harsh ride?	1
	so, why are people jumping to the conclusion of 'suspension defects' when all this data is available?	1
	i know i'm not the only one who scours the web for data like this.	1
	could it be possible that certain individuals have an agenda?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4236#msg4236research really pays off        one more thing...                                before i buy a car, i review every important aspect of the car.	1
	tires are a major factor in performance, ride comfort, and future maintenance costs.	1
	if i were buying a genesis, i'd have walked onto the dealer lot equipped with knowledge from these tire reviews.	1
	not only would i have the dealer check tire psi before test driving the different genesis trims, but i would take the car on all different types of road surfaces, at speeds up to 75 mph.	1
	if the dealer had a problem with me test driving the car for 20, 30, or 40 miles, i'd have said 'take care, bye now' and moved on to the next dealer.	1
	if i found the ride to be unacceptably rough on certain surfaces, and the psi to be set properly on all 4 tires, and if i really liked everything else about the car... i would tell the dealer 'replace these harsh dunlop tires with some bridegestone turanza serenities, or some michelin primacy mxv4's, and i will buy this car.'	1
	sure, it's maybe a $500 loss for the dealer (at their cost), but they really want to sell that $35,000 or $40,000 car.	1
	any dealer who is too stingy to make that slight compromise would not get my business.	1
	period.	1
	please note, i'm not trying say dunlop tires are bad.	1
	in fact, i've read that they provide incredible grip during track testing.	1
	genesis buyers who value road grip more than anything else would very likely want to keep the oem dunlop tires on the car.       	1

	[donna388]        i'm not sure all can be boiled down to tires.	1
	i have tried 30 psi in the tires - no difference.	1
	the odd thing is that the ride is very good in the rain - none of the concerns are evident when it rains - any insights on that?.	1
	that of course makes one think tires, but the reps thought the tires were carefuly chosen.....  a mercedes tech also suggested yesterday that i have the alignment checked out more thoroughly.	1
	i don't think they really checked that when i first brought it in since they felt all was normal.	1
	i'll try that and see what comes up.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4243#msg4243re: your the pot calling the kettle what?	1
	[donna388]        maybe it depends on where you came up...growing up, it was always said, 'the pot calling the kettle black.	1
	oh, by the way, this is just for you.	1
	i googled the phrase 'stove calling the kettle black' and this is what came up:                                 goenglish.com - idioms                                peer pressure for some wheels???	1
	i don't follow everyone else, i lead my own way.	1

	trust me, far from a hard jiggly feel you suggest.	1

	i've been trying to get as much insight as possible to help me decide what to do, etc..  i don't worry too much what others say.	1
	i've found that it is very easy to question motive - as if someone for some unknown reason would just devote one's life to posting bad stuff about the genesis.	1
	i have no trouble believing those who sya they have no concern about the ride or any negative experience.	1
	i'm not sure, however, why they have so much trouble believing anyone else may have an issue or concern.	1
	and why they are so threatened by those that do?	1
	i guess i could question the motive of those who are perfectly happy and yet can't refrain from constantly commenting on an issue they have no concern about.	1
	not sure why they can't tolerate any negative experience at all.	1
	and yes, i have i detailed my issue in the genny owners suspension forum to try to get some insight and find others with similar experience.	1
	not sure why that should bother anyone.	1

	it was held in canada at some famous race track and on the cobblestone streets and windy roads of canada.	1
	three different experienced drives took it out.	1
	nothing but positives... amenities, power, handling etc... they were all amazed it was a hyundai.	1

	to quote him/paraphrase but pretty close to an actual quote 'you get all these amenities, a/c seat, rear camera, they all commented on the incredible sound system.. endless list of features mentioned.'..	1
	then he named a plethora of luxury sedans and said 'you get all this at 1/2 the price... so unless you need a badge/logo (what i choose to call ego and a closed mind that another company can do better then the old stand bys-bmw, lexus, acura, infiniti, mercedes).	1
	my doctor took it out and says it drives, handles and has more options then his $85,000 mercedes.	1
	but he will not buy one as he needs to go into the dr. lot at the hospitals and fears the 'snickers' of owning a hyundai.	1
	he will buy one if hyundai changes their strategy and starts an upscale division.	1

	i would expect that a tire company might be willing to 'tune' tires to suit a manufacturer's specifications and suspension design.	1
	we were discussing that in the tire forum as well as the venza forum.	1
	yeah, that does happen.	1
	the mazda miata was initially delivered on custom bridgestones developed especially for it.	1
	bmw and porsche have their own model designation for a particular tire on a particular vehicle.	1
	the original dodge caravan had a 1-off or 2-off size that met the needs and weight characteristics of that vehicle.	1
	i find it interesting when people cite vehicle handling as a purchase consideration and then complain about the tires or come replacement time, get the cheapest zippy-the-pin-head retread and then complain how it doesn't handle like it used to.	1
	in driving a genesis around the midwest, i found the ride quality acceptable on the 3rd world roads they call highways around here.	1
	that said, i am willing to compromise ride 'serenity' for handling, and i am not the genesis' market segment.       	1

	[johnnw]        the harsh ride you described disappearing in the rain and becoming 'very good' is hard to comprehend.	1
	rain by itself shouldn't have any effect on ride smoothness.	1
	to my knowledge, there is no such thing (yet) as a 'rain-sensing suspension.'	1
	however... when it rains, it usually gets colder.	1
	when it gets colder, tire pressure is reduced (about 1 psi per 10 degrees f).	1
	perhaps colder weather could also affect the performance of the shocks?	1
	also, when it rains, people tend to drive differently (e.g.	1
	more slowly and carefully) than in dry weather.	1
	so i think there are some other factors at work here.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4269#msg4269re: your the pot calling the kettle what?	1
	[backy]        temperature has been suggested as a factor - but we've been unable to find a consistent affect.	1
	yesterday and today i'm experimenting with adding 160 pounds of weight in the trunk as others have done - though it helps the ride around town it did not improve the highway ride this morning.	1

	i have nothing by complements from those who have ridden in the car.	1
	i've had no serious suspension issues.	1
	when i first got the car i though the ride was very hard.	1
	i checked the psi in my tires and noticed that each one was at 37 psi.	1
	i dropped them down to 33 psi and the ride was like night and day.	1
	i did have a problem with the car pulling to the left and took it into the dealer for adjustment.	1
	i will admit the car is very sensitive to road crowning and does pull to the left or right depending on the road.	1
	the longer i own the car the more i feel it loosen up.	1
	it was stiff in the beginning , but now it's feels great.	1
	the pulling does concern me a bit and i believe the dunlop's are the root cause.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4272#msg4272i pulled the trigger...        well, i did it.	1
	yesterday i went to the dealer, my dealer, up here in canada, to talk with my sales director cause my lease on my azera is finishing in june.	1
	i left my home at 10:00am and got back at 18:15. i live 13 minutes from the dealer!	1
	long story short...i tried the v6 and then tried the v8 (the v8 was brand spanking new from the showroom, they had to take it out for my test drive, it had 3km on it).	1
	for me, the v8 was a big difference.	1
	it felt more composed, solid, and i found it quieter.	1
	i found the suspension somewhat stiff and responded quickly of road feel.	1
	the brakes are unreal!	1
	the cars stops so fast and it feels effortless.	1
	i drove the car for almost an hour!	1
	i did alot of highway and city driving.	1
	the car feels great in city and highway driving.	1
	i went on some pretty bad city roads and found no issues with suspension performance, it actually felt great.. i felt no suspension issues at all.	1
	(i was worried after reading all these suspension issues here and there).	1
	after my test drive all suspension issues for me are gone!	1
	this car is absolutely beautiful and felt great.	1
	at one time i was cruising at 120km and floored it to see how much power it had and was suddenly at 160km in no time.	1
	wow is all that came to mind!	1
	the whole test drive (v6 and v8) i was alone with my wife in the car.	1
	the fit 'n' finish of this car is beautiful and very rich looking.	1
	at the end of my test drive i already felt like i'd been driving it for months.	1
	i found that pretty weird!	1
	anyways...i then got back to the dealer and signed a contract on the spot for the v8 tech package.	1
	man they are not kidding when people write if you try the v8, make sure your ready to buy!	1
	my otd price is $56,206.65cdn or $44,527.78usd.	1

	i'm happy about the free maintnance cause i average 30,000km/year.	1

	from my understanding, the lexicon system in the genesis uses optical interfaces between the head unit and the amp which could make it real tricky in terms of splicing in for a usable signal.	1
	like you, i have yet to own a car that i didn't upgrade the sound system, but the genesis factory system sounds that good where you don't have to touch it but so much.	1
	the only thing lacking for my tastes is the bottom end of music.	1
	the genesis system clearly has more oomph when it comes to the lower frequencies than the azera system did, but not quite what i prefer.	1
	it sounds like you'll have a challenge on your hands and the only thing i can really suggest to you is to contact harman-kardon's oem dept.	1
	and ask questions about how you can pull off adding an aftermarket amp to the system while leaving the rest alone.	1
	they were truly instrumental to me when i swapped my system out.	1
	good luck!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4277#msg4277genesis prestige        official images of the new hyundai equus has come out.	1
	it's hyundai's version of the ls/s-class/7-series/a8.	1
	it's for the korean market, but may come to the u.s. as the 'genesis prestige'.	1
	it's available in 3.8/4.6 form -- and a 5.0l 420hp long-wheelbase form at a later date.	1
	priced at $93k in korea (but likely around $50k if sold in the u.s.).	1

	could it possibly make its way into the genesis as a m5, amg, s6 fighter?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4278#msg4278suspension of the genesis        i've been reading alot of the posts on this forum about the suspension for the genesis and came to the conclusion that this suspension is not for everyone.	1
	people this vehicle was not designed to be a luxo sport sedan, it was designed to be a luxo cruise sedan period end of story.	1
	so if your in the market for a luxo sport sedan than this is clearly not the car for you.	1
	if you buy one thinking thats what your gonna get than bash it because it's not living up to its billing than shame on you, it will be your fault for making the purchase not hyundai.	1
	end of story.	1
	now i have a real con for the genesis and its not one those its has a bad suspension or the fuel economy was not that good kinda of cons.	1
	i only hope and pray that hyundai adds the cooled seat for the pass side on the 2010 model.	1
	to me this is the only con worth mentioning.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4279#msg4279re: suspension of the genesis [lashawn]        it's nice to see someone else actually realize the reality of things.	1
	this is the same issue that happend with the azera.	1
	folks love the fact that the genesis costs much less than anything else it can actually be compared to, but that isn't enough for folks.	1
	they want more, they want the car to be more than what it actually is to justify to their friends and families why they paid what they paid for a hyundai (this only pertains to those who don't 'get it').	1
	putting the price into perspective, the omission of the cooled seats really isn't a con considering cars costing $10k or more don't even stack up against what the genesis offers you as a whole package.	1
	while the cooled seats would be a nice addition...i personally don't think it's something that hurts it.	1
	i'm pretty sure if hyundai has been paying attention to the people, it's a feature that may find its way into the car in a future refresh.       	1

	john, have you ever considered that it's just your car that rides rough?	1
	since your car  (by your own admission) rode ok with the hyundai rep along for a ride, are you sure you're not imagining it?	1
	i'm sure you know how your imagination can exaggerate things when you're alone in complete silence.	1
	maybe you should listen to talk radio while driving and see how it goes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4288#msg4288re: suspension of the genesis [johnnw]        no...i'm completely blind to the fact of the suspension issues some have complained about.	1
	it's really no different than the suspension issues going on with the azera.	1
	however, it's not a universal problem with either vehicle.	1
	some experience it and some don't.	1
	just because i don't have the issue with my particuarl car, i'm not discounting what someone else experiences.	1
	it's just that some folks get a bit overly dramatic when describing the problem, claiming that it's just so unsafe that it will cause one to lose control of their car and crash.	1
	that part i don't understand is how these folks didn't realize the suspension was an issue because a test drive would have shown them that.	1
	it really kills me how folks claim they went and test drove a vehicle, but a few weeks later (after purchase) they are complaining about this issue or that issue that clearly would have come out in a real test drive.	1
	personally, i refuse to buy a car if i can't take it for a ride that satisfies my curiosities.	1
	when i bought my azera, i drove it over the very roads i drive on my daily commute.	1
	i had the car for about 2 hours and the dealer had no problem with that.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4289#msg4289re: genesis prestige [joe97]        i think when the comparison was made to the size of the 7 series, it was re interior room.	1
	the new equus appears to compare with the 7 series in exterior size also.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4290#msg4290re: genesis prestige [backy]        yeah, i think so too.	1
	the genesis actually boasts larger overall interior volume than the 7 series.	1
	the exterior is more comparable to a 7 series swb.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4291#msg4291re: genesis prestige [xj220]        it is un vetty, vetty nice, ya?	1

	i like it.	1
	also, hyundai has developed a supercharged 4.6l v8 prototype making 460hp.	1
	could it possibly make its way into the genesis as a m5, amg, s6 fighter?	1
	a fighter?	1
	probably not with just 460hp.	1
	an alternative?	1
	quite possibly if they can work on the suspension tuning.	1
	maybe they'll go back to lotus for help in that area.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4292#msg4292genesis coupe!!!	1
	well...i just got back from my dealer (alexandria hyundai) and they have a black genesis coupe 3.8, with black leather interior, on the showroom floor that they just got in yesterday.	1
	walking up on it...the lines are clean and evoke motion even when parked.	1
	sitting in it, the seat was comfortable and very accomodating for a tall guy (i'm 6'2' and weight 215 lbs).	1
	i got to turn it on to acc mode and hear the sound system and it didn't disappoint.	1
	the dash is laid out nicely, the center stack is comfortably in reach of the driver, the functions are laid out pretty nicely.	1
	i wish i could say i got to test drive it, but i can't.	1
	i wanted to, but between it being the only one they had and me being pressed for time...                                i'm looking forward to a test drive, that's for sure!!!	1
	on another note, this dealership seems to 'get it' in terms of how they treat the genesis.	1
	the store itself isn't anything to brag about, but you get in the showroom and they have put the genesis sedan up on a wood floor...showcasing it.	1
	i was pleased to see that they are treating the genesis like it's truly a flagship within the confines of what they have to work with.	1
	i have also noticed they are doing renovations to make the environment more pleasant as well.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4293#msg4293re: 2008-2009 hyundai genesis [rockylee]        yes i know finally hyundai might have done something good for once!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4294#msg4294re: hyundai is moving up fast        this is one amazing value for a car in this price range.	1
	although the m35 and gs350 are more refined, there is a difference but also look at the price differentiation?	1
	hyundai will still be ironing out and fine tweaking any issues.	1
	considering the position that sonata has moved to, i've sure the genesis will be giving the asian counterparts something to think about.	1
	toyota did it in 1990 for lexus.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4295#msg4295re: suspension of the genesis [allmet33]        sorry i test drove a demo extensively on two different occassions  - including a snowy day.	1
	the first time i had it for an entire day and drove all my usual routes.	1
	it was raining however.	1
	had the demo rode like my car i expereince now i never would have bought it.	1
	yes, air pressure was checked.	1
	i have since driven several other genny's and they all have the sub-standard ride.	1
	the reality is that the us suspensio cannot handle real world driving.	1
	i;m sure its great on the test track or absolutley perfect roads.	1
	even my passengers comment on the 'bouncy ride' and reprt even feeling ill in back.	1
	the ride is not good period.	1
	some tolerate it is all.	1
	drive another car back to back and you'll understand.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4296#msg4296re: suspension of the genesis [johnnw]        johnnw (doug725) - maybe it's the way you drive?	1

	but we appreciate the updates        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4297#msg4297re: suspension of the genesis [johnnw]         even my passengers comment on the 'bouncy ride' and reprt even feeling ill in back.	1
	maybe it is the way you drive!!!	1
	honestly, if you're going in expecting the driving dynamics of a bmw or a benz...you're setting yourself up for disappointment.	1
	while hyundai got a great many things right with the genesis, there's a few things that obviously need to be tweaked.	1
	i tested a genesis and drove it over city streets at speeds up to about 45-50 miles and hour and it handled wonderfully.	1
	hitting potholes, bumps and sunken manhole covers (all purposely) never caused the car to lose it's composure.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4298#msg4298re: suspension of the genesis [allmet33]        sorry - setting myself up for disappointment is not valid - i haven't even driven a bmw.	1
	i know many want to pin the issuse on the owner in any convoluted way possible, but the car is what it is.	1
	it's too sensitive to side to side and up and down motion.	1
	when a mercury milan has better ride dynamics and less 'business' transferred through the seats you know you have an issue.	1
	i'm aware many like the ride and that's great (though admitedly surprising to me personally - especially since none of my passengers have enjoyed the ride in the least).	1
	the combo of the roads here and the suspension characteristics is a horrible match.	1
	i'm aware that there are those who experience the ride characteristics and like it/and or in some cases tolerate it (even in my area).	1
	i did notice that other cars - the v8 in particular have what i consider excessive floatiness and motion, but not the same level of constant nervous pitching as mine.	1
	having also driven the '09 sonata and sante fe today i can say they exhibit some of the same ride characteristics on the roads here as the genny.	1
	it's not quite as extreme or annoying, but still present.	1
	actually the 2009 sante fe rides worse than my 2002.5 did.	1
	drove the mercury milan today and the nissan murano - both drove absolutely fine over these roads - especially the milan (firm yet smooth).	1
	also am driving the m35 today on extended test.	1
	it's like night and day compared to the genny.	1
	imo suspensions are the weak link in the hyundai lineup.	1
	you often hear it described as suspension clunk, bounciness or noise, etc.	1
	the azera had ongoing suspension issue - though i am not aware of the extent.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4299#msg4299re: suspension of the genesis [johnnw]        you are giving us a convincing case (if we needed convincing!)	1
	that a thorough test drive is always in order to be sure the car we are purchasing suits our individual wants and needs.	1
	i think it's time we accepted that there are differing viewpoints here, all valid, none 'wrong'.	1
	let's acknowledge that we have different expectations and experiences and accept that we're not going to change each others' minds on those things.	1
	with all of that in mind, it's time to move on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4300#msg4300re: suspension of the genesis [pat]        pat, you're absolutely right.	1
	there are some of us who like the suspension and some of us don't, whatever the case may be just drop it.	1
	i'm sure someone at hma has read these posts and others and are working on a way to correct, so everyone talking about it is kinda pointless; unless you people just wanna vent and get it off you chest.	1
	i say if you keep having an issue than there are two things you can do about it.	1
	1) deal with it and get over it.	1
	2) get another vehicle.	1
	problem solved.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4301#msg4301re: suspension of the genesis [lashawn]        if you don';t want to hear about it or discuss it then don't read it or respond - i'm just replying to others on this topic - so take the above advice and 'get over it'       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4302#msg4302re: suspension of the genesis [lashawn]        here here!!!	1
	i've had enough of the same tired rant every day.	1
	either sell it or accept it, one or the other!!	1
	for most of us, we're very satisfied with our genny's.	1
	sure there are some minor tweaks but certainly not enough to spoil an overall great ride!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4303#msg4303suspension issues        i really don't have a problem with someone posting about an issue they have with any aspect of the car.	1
	the only time it becomes suspicious is when the description of the problem is overly dramatized and blown out of proportion.	1
	like lashawn said, there are those that completely enjoy the way the genesis rides and it seems there are those that don't.	1
	the only thing i can ask is...how did this issue pop up mysteriously after the car was purchased???	1
	i mean...a thorough test drive would bring the issue to light and if it truly was an issue, why would you buy the car only to complain about it after the fact?	1
	if you did test drive the genesis and you didn't like how it rode, fine...post your test drive findings and keep it moving.	1
	i think the issue is that there are some that post with what seems like an agenda as opposed to just being someone posting about their experience...good, bad or indifferent.	1
	it's just funny how there are a few folks that complain about the ride in various forums (and believe me, the number of those actually complaining isn't that great), but every auto publication that has tested either or both versions of the genesis have all given it good reviews on the ride.	1
	the concensus seems to be that it rides good, but it certainly isn't a bmw in terms of driving dynamic.	1
	if anything, more than one write up has compared the ride of the genesis to that of an infiniti/lexus.	1
	again, i don't have a problem with someone posting about something they don't like about the car (everyone's entitled), but don't make it seem like everyone has to go along with your thinking or that we're crazy for not agreeing with you.	1
	if you had a 'bad' experience during your test drive and you ended up not buying the car because of it...then what more do you really have to say?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4304#msg4304re: hyundai genesis steering problem needs to be addressed [allmet33]        i appreciate your advice, and your right, you would never expect this problem in a rear wheel drive car.	1
	the first thing that was checked by the dealer was tire pressure, tire condition (new tires) and wheel alignment.	1
	the dealer service department test drove the car less then a mile on surface streets and reported it to be normal.	1
	when i questioned the service advisor about the tendency of the car to drift on crowned sloped surfaces, he said, at this time there is no fix for that problem.	1
	it's a very annoying problem and can be fatiging on long trips.	1
	another problem is the excessive steering wheel chatter that is transmitted from the front suspension.	1
	with all that being said, the genisis is a fine car, as long as your on a level road.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4305#msg4305         when a mercury milan has better ride dynamics and less 'business' transferred through the seats you know you have an issue.	1
	this issue is more a tribute to the milan than a whack at any competitor.	1
	the fusion triplets have long been noted for having outstanding suspensions with excellent ride-handling balance, as well as very good value for money.	1
	while $30,000 should buy you even better, lots of other pricey cars (cough*lexuses*cough) don't pass this particular test either.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4306#msg4306re: hyundai genesis steering problem needs to be addressed [bmichael]        honestly, i don't know what to say.	1
	phsyics would indicate if you're driving along a sloped surface, gravity will pull you down the slope.	1
	i have noticed it when i drive my azera...there are some roads that seem to have a steeper slope from the middle to the outer edge than some.	1
	the ones that have a very minor slope don't really seem to affect the tracking of the car, however...the steeper ones do.	1
	i wish i could say it was characteristic of only hyundai vehicles, but it seems to affect the saturn outlook as well.	1
	when you mention steering wheel chatter being transmitted from the front suspension...what is the existing situation that causes it?	1
	i only ask because when i tested a genesis, i purposely drove over pot holes, sunken manhole covers and various undulations in the roads to see if the car would lose it's composure it didn't.	1
	the steering wheel remained firm in my hands, it never yanked one way or the other and the car never felt like it was on the verge of being out of control.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4307#msg4307re: hyundai genesis steering problem: can alignment fix?	1
	i'm wondering if this particular owner would be happier if the suspension were deliberately aligned somewhat away from factory specs to have more self-straightening tendency.	1
	a quick googling suggests that both toe-in and caster angles have an influence on this.	1
	maybe a good independent shop can help.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4308#msg4308re: hyundai genesis steering problem: can alignment fix?	1
	[tonycd]        maybe, but then if you're setting the alignment to be better suited for driving on 'crowned' roads, what would happen on flat ones?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4309#msg4309re: suspension of the genesis [johnnw]        why reply to what they say if your're gonna say the same thing?	1
	like i said earlier 'get over it' find something else to talk about, if you could because the suspension seems to be the only thing about the genesis that's a flaw; in most people's eyes anyway.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4310#msg4310re: hyundai genesis steering problem: can alignment fix?	1
	[allmet33]        maybe, but then if you're setting the alignment to be better suited for driving on 'crowned' roads, what would happen on flat ones?	1
	nothing.	1
	just a tad more steering effort and a tad more tire wear.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4311#msg4311re: suspension of the genesis [lashawn]        on the other hand, there is something to be said for ignoring the posts that do not provide value for you.	1

	also, the mkz doesn't compare with the genesis in any way, shape or form.	1

	however, it rode very nicely.	1
	and he's right i can hardly ever lean my head on the headrest in the genny without feeling like a bobblehead.	1

	who leans their head back against the headrest while driving???	1
	i've test driven the genesis and certainly didn't have the experience that some have mentioned in this forum.	1
	i'm not discounting it at all.	1
	the only question i could really ask is exactly what type of surfaces are being driven on that bring forth the type of experience that some are posting on.	1
	personally, i would love to see video or pictures.	1
	i drove over pot holes, uneven roads and the car never lost its poise.	1
	one poster made it seem that he actually went 4-wheeling in his genesis with the way he described the problem.	1
	even the road tests that have been on the speed channel have shown the car handling quite nicely.	1
	there's one segment where the driver takes a corner and the wheels actually are on the washboard border of the track and he never even mentions anything about it...and this would be at speeds bettering that of city driving.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4322#msg4322re: genesis a rough ride indeed [koury]        wow...that's crazy.	1
	i mean...i do rest my head against the headrest, but in most cases...the car is either parked or stopped.	1
	the only other time would be when i'm stretching on a long ride or something like that.	1
	i'm just really curious at to how these people drive to be honest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4323#msg4323re: genesis a rough ride indeed [allmet33]        i believe these people are idiots to be honest with you.	1
	i mean enough already, time to move on.	1
	the car has a subpar suspension setup to some people, but not all think so.	1
	i personally like the way the car rides.	1
	if some of you people don't like the ride of the car than don't buy it.	1
	if you already bought one and you don't like the ride of it now, shame on you for not doing your homework; live with it or get rid of it.	1
	simple.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4324#msg4324re: genesis a rough ride indeed [lashawn]        i would have to agree...i think there were a good many folks that purchased without much of a test drive.	1
	some complained that they weren't afforded anything more than a cruise around the block.	1
	if that were the case, i wouldn't have bought from that salesperson or that store if that were the case.	1
	if i'm serious about purchasing and they know it...they won't have a problem with me logging in some driving time to get a full feel for the car (they let me take the azera for a spin for 2.5 hours).	1
	i can't imagine anyone actually buying the car if the suspension is as bad as they claim it to be.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4326#msg4326re: genesis a rough ride indeed [koury]        there's a suspension thread on the genesis owners site that has approx 190 posts.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4327#msg4327re: genesis a rough ride indeed [davidlazerr9]        certainly if the the driver's experience was like a human bobblehead, then this major flaw would have been pointed out a long long time ago; surely lots of people, and i do mean lots, have tested this car, including the industry critics, and no such issue popped up.	1
	i've personally driven both the genesis v6 and v8, and in various different trims - no such issue in any of the cars tested.	1

	i've got 3500 on my v6 and it seems to happen more when the car is warming up...but can occur at other times.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4334#msg4334re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [genesis57]        hyundai has had open throttle issues in 1st gear.	1
	my '02 sonata had the problem and my '06 azera had the problem.	1
	it was merely a reprogramming that needed to be done to clear up the issue.	1
	for those that don't understand...basically, no matter how little you depress the gas pedal, the throttle opens up all the way causing a surge that doesn't match the pedal effort applied.	1
	gentle pressure on the gas pedal should equal a smooth  easy take off.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4335#msg4335re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [allmet33]        my 06 sonata recently had problems with a sensor failing in accelerator pedal at 35000 miles.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4336#msg4336re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [bman900]        did the sensor fail cause wide open throttle starts?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4337#msg4337re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [allmet33]        my sensor fail actually did the opposite.	1
	it caused the engine to go into 'limp power mode' - probably a safety measure.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4338#msg4338re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [bman900]        that makes sense.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4343#msg4343re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[dean3927]        looks like hyundai plans to use genesis cues in its other sedans.	1
	which is a good thing.	1
	but i think the sonata (if the renderings are anything like the real car will be) is a more unique style for its class than the genesis is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4344#msg4344re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[backy]        hey, that sonata is looking good.	1
	i realize the renderings are educated guesses based on rumors, camoflaged cars, and trends within the industry and company.	1
	i hope the yf sonata looks close to the picture.	1
	i also hope it takes cues from the genesis interior.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4345#msg4345re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[bobad]        it would be nice if hyundai would bring over a nice compact pick-up.	1

	imo.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4346#msg4346re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[houdini1]        i think a pickup was in hyundai's plans, until fuel prices rose last year.	1
	but yea, toyota needs some competition.	1
	i recently looked at every pickup on the market and had to take the lesser of the evils, a tacoma.	1
	it wouldn't be hard for hyundai to compete with it in price and quality, especially with a 5 or 6 cyl diesel.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4347#msg4347re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[dean3927]        pretty sure this particular rendering has already been discredited as a photochop of a genesis photograph.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4348#msg4348re: the genesis had better watch out!	1
	[tonycd]        the blog was quite clear it is a 'rendering' that includes the front end of a genesis.	1
	but the overall lines of the car, the sides, the general appearance of the grill, and the roofline have been confirmed by spy photos.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4349#msg4349re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [genesis57]        to genesis57 (regarding surging):                                for whatever reason, i am no longer experiencing the power surge during takeoffs.	1
	however, the transmission is programmed to shift from 1st to 2nd at very low speeds anytime you make a slow, easy takeoff.	1
	i assume this is to improve fuel economy.	1
	this can sometimes cause a slight surge when it changes gears.	1
	you will notice that if you make a more spirited takeoff, everything feels as it should.	1
	you are correct that the engine programming keeps it at higher rpm's than most other cars after startup when the engine is cold but as soon as it starts warming up, it settles back to a normal idling speed.	1
	i am now at 19,000 miles on the odometer.	1
	i will post another round of my impressions (mostly good) when it reaches 20,000 miles.       	1

	i've been wondering how a rear wheel drive vehicle with traction  stability does in snow covered roads?	1
	that is if your from a snow belt region.	1
	or anybody that has driven the genesis in the snow.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4351#msg4351re: the genesis had better watch out!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4353#msg4353re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [colegar]         i assume this is to improve fuel economy.	1
	i think you're right.	1
	there must be many compromises to get excellent mileage and low emissions from a car that big.	1
	i think you can cheat it when new by staying on the gas a little harder to keep it from shifting.	1
	the transmission should  'learn' the higher shift point and stay put for at least a good while.	1
	don't know if 19k is too late to re establish the shift points, but you can always re-set it.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4354#msg4354re: my impressions after 1,200 miles [stush]        i'm have not driven the genesis on snow but i have driven other rear-wheel drive cars (lexus, bmw, mercedes) on both snow and ice.	1
	on snow, if you are an experienced slick-road driver, you can manage to get around fairly well on all except steep hills.	1
	on ice, leave it parked in the garage!	1
	most traction control systems have a computer brain that modulates the abs brake system and throttle response to in effect apply braking to the wheel that has lost traction.	1
	most cars have an open differential rather than a locking differential and therefore transfer the tourqe to the opposite wheel when the traction system applies braking to one wheel.	1
	it certainly achieves better results than not having a traction control system but it does not come close to having all-wheel drive (or even front-wheel drive).	1
	also, you will feel and hear  'chattering' as the traction system modulates the abs braking back and forth between the two drive wheels as each of them lose traction intermiently.	1
	before i go any further and get over in over my head, i will quit trying to act like an engineer!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4355#msg4355suspension        interesting that there are always new people complaining about genesis or azera suspension/ride, but the same few people always respond and attack them.	1
	regardless, consumer reports did pick the genesis as number one in its class, but commented negatively three times about the ride in its review.	1
	also, in their april issue, they stated one of the negatives of hyundai cars is the suspension.	1
	furthermore, please see                 http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2009-hyundai-genesis-1.htm                , particularly the ratings chart and the comments from professional reviewers.       	1

	yes - a no.	1
	of people have issues w/ their suspensions, but the vast majority of owners don't (look at the owner feedback reviews here or on the genesisowners forum).	1
	likely, it seems to be a problem due to the shocks (even tho being the same part no.	1

	you may find, like i did myself, that you have a different view point based on what you find out from your own test drive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4365#msg4365re: genesis a rough ride indeed [allmet33]        before i bought my bmw i did a number of test drives.	1
	however, reading about them in forums such as edmunds uncovered a theme relating to niggling electrical issues, obviously not something a test drive would show unless a failure occured during the test drive.	1
	this was one data point used to determine whether to go ahead with the purchase.	1
	had i experienced an electrical failure the ending may have been different.	1
	there are a number of posts on the subject, with a lot of varied interpetation.	1
	one mans hard suspension is another mans loose suspension.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4367#msg4367re: genesis a rough ride indeed [kdshapiro]        i'm not arguing the fact that it is indeed a data point.	1
	i definitely feel that it's something that folks going in should take a look at for themselves to see if it's the same issue for them as it was for someone that posted it.	1
	i had heard the horror stories about hyundai ownership and out of 3 hyundai vehicles (87 excel, 02 sonata  06 azera), ownership has been wonderful.	1
	none of those cars has left me stranded anywhere and any issues that came up were either easy to fix myself or the warranty covered it (with the exception of the excel as the warranty wasn't in place back then).	1
	however, the excel was the longest lived of them all...as the car met it's demise in 1996 due to being t-boned by a buick, but it had over 250k miles on it.	1
	the sonata went 4 years with 105k miles on it before being traded for my current azera (which currently has 65k miles on it).	1
	the point i'm trying to make is that i know folks that could dog hyundai for the bad experience they've had (i'm not talking about those that trash hyundai based on what they've heard), but with the 3 vehicles i've had...i have nothing but postive things to say.	1
	you can read about the issues some have with the genesis suspension, but you may go out and really like the way the car rides, handles and performs and come back and be able to put a post that would give a differing opinion compared to the ones complaining.	1
	however, there's also a chance you might see exactly what those are saying and your post would say as much.       	1

	these are                   not                  my comments.	1
	i post them because many people are seeking information and these are sources i have found and wish to share that information with those seeking objective analysis of cars.	1
	it also gets old for the same people to attack anyone who criticizes their beloved hyundai's.	1
	it was posted on both the azera and genesis sites because both cars have suspension issues per the                   professionals                 .	1
	not to mention the many who have driven or purchased the cars and complain of the suspension/ride.	1
	before you automatically attack, why don't you read the articles/websites that i have referenced all this time?	1
	perhaps as jack nicholson said, 'you can't handle the truth'?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4369#msg4369re: suspension [carolinabob]        bob...you're actually one of the few that post information that makes sense.	1
	there have been a few that posted about suspension issues in such dramatic fashion as to make the vehicles out to be totally unsafe.	1
	the only point of contention is where you say the 'many' that have made complaints.	1
	honestly...if you go to each of the forums, there may be a few here and there, but hardly a large number of folks.	1
	in some cases you have one person posting under a few various screen names, so it makes it seem like the problem is really bigger than it is.	1
	yes, various publications have stated that the suspension could be better, but none have said that the suspension should be reason for alarm or concern.	1
	truly, i don't mind someone posting something that they have personally found in their own experience, but you have quite a few that will post about what they read or heard from someone else, which again...sounds like another unhappy customer complaining and in reality...that person hasn't even driven one.	1
	just like the great many that tried to knock the azera with a lot of bad talk, but had never even sat in one.	1
	it happens, but usually...after a few postings you can point out the ones that are just parroting facts or statements they've heard elsewhere.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4370#msg4370re: genesis a rough ride indeed [kdshapiro]        unlike suspension issues for the genesis or azera (which is case by case and found in a minority of owners), the issue w/ the suspension for the x3 is universal.	1
	pretty much every auto review has commented on the harsh, jumpy ride of the x3.	1
	i can also personally attest since my parents bought an x3 before i could intervene (they would have done much better purchasing a 5 series estate - except for the heineous idrive).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4371#msg4371re: suspension [carolinabob]        oh please - there are tons of professional reviews out there which comment about harsh or jiggly suspensions about plenty of other models (for instance, edmunds takes issue w/ the suspension of the new mustang, esp.	1
	the version w/o the track pack).	1
	if these professional reviewers had experienced the type of suspension problems that a minority of (vocal) owners of the genesis/azera have been experiencing, they would not recommend the genesis or the azera (which pretty much every review does).	1
	what the reviewers who do note something state is something that is not uncommon in reviews of other autos (and a good many reviewers had no issue at all w/ the suspension, except for maybe wishing the suspension was tuned even tighter a la the 5 series).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4372#msg4372re: suspension [carolinabob]         i post them because many people are seeking information and these are sources i have found and wish to share that information with those seeking objective analysis of cars.	1

	if you were interested in informing the public in an honest and balanced way, you wouldn't go on many forums under different aliases to get your licks in against your perceived adversary.	1
	it's very easy to see what you're trying to do.	1
	instead of trying to embarrass hyundai in public and creating false impressions, why don't you take it up with your dealer?	1
	and try being nice.	1
	you're much more likely to get help with your perceived problem.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4374#msg4374re: genesis a rough ride indeed [jyym]         pretty much every auto review has commented on the harsh, jumpy ride of the x3.	1

	i have multiple model years and found it firm, not harsh, not jumpy in typical bmw style.	1
	so goes the saying one mans meat is another mans potatoes.	1
	which is the point i was suggesting.	1
	kind of like criticizing the vette for only having two seats.	1
	additionally even if the problem with the genesis/x3 is perceived i agree perception is reality, which is why this is a datapoint  and you have to make up your own mind.	1
	in addition, just because one might not feel the issue, doesn't mean it's not there.	1
	and i'll be fair and say this applies to the x3 also.       	1

	absolutely not.	1
	however, i've been here long enough to witness countless number of people claiming the suspension is bad, yet they haven't even driven one yet.	1
	contribute if you have first-hand knowledge, don't just regurgitate what others have mentioned or what you have read in a magazine.	1
	where's the value in that?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4378#msg4378re: suspension [bobad]        1.  if you read all my posts, you will see where i said the azera would be a 10 if they fixed the suspension.	1
	2.  i have test driven four different genesis models and agreed with consumer reports, consumer guide, car  driver and automobile magazine, et.	1
	al.	1
	that the ride/suspension is not what it should be for this class of car.	1
	3.  all my posts under this forum and others are under carolinabob-never used any other name.	1
	4.  i have never tried to defame hyundai or its cars, just trying to let others know there are issues they need to know before they purchase.	1
	5.  there were hundreds (thousands?)	1
	of postings on this and other sites before i made my first one.	1
	those posts are what let me know that i was far from alone.	1
	6.  it is not a perceived problem or hyundai would not have replaced all the many shocks on azeras that they have replaced already.	1
	many two times.	1
	they are also revising the suspension on the genesis because of what customers and the professionals have said.	1
	7. my 'negative' posts have almost always mentioned a source and you cannot quote entire articles that are 2-5 pages long.	1
	if the person is interested in a full report, they will read the article.	1
	i just let know there is something they may wish to read.	1
	i suppose when edmunds or consumer reports or automobile magazine makes a less than fully favorable report, they are trying to 'embarass' a manufacturer and create 'false impressions.'	1
	i don't think so.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4379#msg4379re: suspension [carolinabob]        consider that                 every                report edmunds or consumer reports or automobile magazine has made on a vehicle has been 'less than fully favorable.'	1
	for instance, no vehicle yet has earned a score of 100, or 'perfect', in cr's tests.	1
	(but the ls has come very, very close.	1
	how much do those cost, anyway?                )	1
	no vehicle is perfect.	1
	it looks like the suspension is a weak area on the genesis sedan, for some owners and for some professional reviewers.	1
	there are other things that could be improved on the genesis also, e.g.	1
	put a seat cooler on the passenger's seat too, huh?	1
	but as you said,                 read the full report                .	1
	there is much more to the genesis than complaints about the suspension.	1
	and i have yet to read a professional review that even hinted that the genesis' suspension is dangerous, a safety risk, or tosses people around in the car and makes them sick as had been reported by some posters here.	1
	to prospective buyers:                 drive the car.	1
	see what                 you                think about the suspension.	1
	if it's not to your liking, there's several other good choices for sedans with comparable performance and features.	1
	they might cost more, but if that's an issue... buy a 'previously owned' unit.	1
	this kind of car depreciates pretty fast.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4380#msg4380re: suspension [carolinabob]        i hope they                 are                revising the suspension settings on next year's genesis.	1
	anyone with a complaint should be sure to write about it on your three-month j.d.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4381#msg4381re: suspension [carolinabob]        carolinabob, maybe you have lost your objectivity on hyundai products.	1
	in your 7 bullet points, you did not admit that you are on a 1 man mission to flood the internet and punish hyundai because you are dissatisfied with azera's suspension.	1
	now you have expanded your campaign to a model you don't even own.	1
	you admitted you have driven 4 different genesis's, without the slightest intention to buy one.	1
	that speaks for itself.	1
	when someone becomes so involved or obsessed that they lose their objectivity, their comments should be weighed accordingly.	1
	where do i stand?	1
	before i buy a car, i read a lot of comments by a lot of owners, throw out the 10 out of 10's and the 1 out of 10's , and do a thorough test drive.	1
	it's very prudent to do that, because dealers can't afford to give refunds like wal-mart.       	1

	.	1
	[donna388]        donna388,  carolinabob has mentioned before that he has test driven the genesis with zero intention of actually buying one.	1
	i can't accurately site which board he mentioned it on as he has been repeating the same thing over and over and over on about every board that mentions the name genesis.	1
	i think he's going through what a lot of 'top model' buyers go through when something newer/better comes along from a manufacturer that knocks the previous top dog down a peg or two.	1
	a feeling of betrayal.	1
	and he's taking it out on the car.	1
	he doesn't truly have an axe to grind w/ the genesis other than it has usurped the azera as the top dog at hyundai.	1
	that being said, with his not owning a genesis or even having any intention of buying one, he really doesn't have an iron in the fire when it comes to launching complaints; legitimate or not.       	1

	they are also revising the suspension on the genesis because of what customers and the professionals have said.	1
	uhm...this is just speculation.	1
	it's been talked about, but nobody has definitively put out a statement.	1
	mis-information on your part as usual.	1
	you said back in november that you were done posting here....i'm assuming because too many people questioned your credibility.	1
	so let me ask - why are you back?	1
	did you buy the genesis?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4385#msg4385re: carolinabob's post .	1
	.	1
	[donna388]        why do you suppose he test-drove so many different examples?	1
	come on now.	1
	get real!	1
	because he is on a 2 year long smear campaign, and looking for credibility.	1
	another angle is, why would he smear a car maker, and then go buy their car?	1
	don't misread me.	1
	carolinabob is just as entitled to his opinion is you and me.	1
	but beyond a reasonable number airings, his opinions become 'stirring the pot', 'loading google', or 'stacking the deck' to suit his agenda.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4386#msg4386hold on folks        i wouldn't go so far as to say someone must own a genesis to provide feedback on the vehicle.	1
	the fact that he's test driven 4 different times would mean he is getting a feel for the car.	1
	i do question his intentions at times because he does seem to allow his suspension issue with his azera override his objectivity.	1
	at least we know he's not one of the ones that jumps on the bandwagon and simply parrots what others have said or goes around quoting automobile reviews without having been in one himself (where there are several that are guilty of that).       	1

	you just continue to attack me or others who post their opinions/information.	1
	10.  my number of posts pales in comparison to those who do not want to hear anything negative about their cars.	1
	many of my posts have been in response to attacks on me or others.	1
	11.  i have often said that people should drive the cars for themselves, but be aware of what others have said.	1
	is this not the real purpose of these forums?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4388#msg4388one thing i don't get        the back and forth in this forum about whether or not the genesis suspension is as bad as some say or not really raises an eyebrow.	1
	for the life of me, i can't understand how we have 'so many' folks with the complaint and yet...the consumer reviews don't exactly reflect that.	1
	i mean...if you look, there are 99 reviews in edmunds in regards to the genesis sedan.	1
	with an average rating of 9.4...that means almost every single person that is writing the reviews is rating it 9.0 or higher.	1
	if the complaints are truly legitimate, then post reviews reflecting as such.	1
	lower ratings make people take notice.	1
	granted, almost 100 reviews doesn't come close to being the number of genesis owners in america today, but it would indicate to the average consumer reading them that the genesis is a pretty darn good car.	1
	with as much media coverage as the genesis has received, i'm sure most that have, are or will be interested in the genesis will have read the reviews and know about the so called 'suspension issues'  they will read and compare that information with the consumer reviews posted on edmunds and any other places consumer reviews can be posted.	1
	going by edmunds alone, one would find it hard to believe that the suspension is truly that much of an issue if at least 100 people consistently rated it 9.0 or better.	1
	i would be more leery if it had a rating between 7-8, but 9.4??	1
	?       	1

	you just continue to attack me or others who post their opinions/information.	1
	are you kidding me?	1
	most of the reviews have said there are cars that handled better (on back roads, for example - like the 5er), but certainly nowhere from the degree in which your posts have indicated.	1
	sure, there are improvements that could be made, but the suspension itself is not the sole indicator of a car, certainly not the only indicator in the class which the genesis is positioned; ditto on the azera.	1
	you have been pleading your case by claiming you are trying to provide objective info to all, so please focus on some other parts of the car as well; focus on the good and the bad, if you are trying to provide 'unbiased info'.       	1

	i think the price is excellent but here are a couple of things they could address for 2010:                tweak the suspension.	1
	i felt stuff (vibration and bumps) while driving at lower speeds.	1
	i actually thought it drove well at the higher speeds.	1
	switch out all of the hyundai logos with the genesis wings logo!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4394#msg4394telescopic steering wheel        i just returned from looking at the genesis.	1
	i was inclined to buying one until salesman told me that the telescopic steering wheel was not standard and could be had only as part of an expensive 'bells and whistles' options package.	1
	this package includes a sunroof that i cannot have because it takes up too much headroom.	1
	so, i crossed the genesis off my list.	1
	what a stupid move by hyundai!	1
	telescopic steering as an option in a 'luxury' car?	1
	this is standard these days in many cars that cost some $10,000 less than a genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4395#msg4395re: telescopic steering wheel [carlupi]        cars that cost $10,000 less than a genesis don't have a                 power                tilt/telescopic steering column, which is the feature in the $2000 package you referred to.	1

	he also modified his claim with 'almost certainly', 'if true' and 'if it happens' while it may be true, the rumor has never been confirmed.by hyundai, the press or other posters.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4397#msg4397re: telescopic steering wheel [backy]        good point about the 'power' aspect of this genesis package.	1
	but, whether it is powered or not, many cars have some form of telescopic steering as a standard feature.	1
	with the driver's seat all the way back in the genesis, which i need to accomodate my long legs, the non-telescopic steering wheel is uncomfortably far away.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4398#msg4398re: telescopic steering wheel [carlupi]        ok, then you really need the telescopic wheel then.	1
	it is odd that a manual telescopic column isn't standard, with the power feature optional.	1
	one thing to try--raise the height of the driver's seat and move it forward.	1
	i've found that kind of position works well for cars w/o a telescopic column or one that doesn't move back enough, provides good thigh support, a better view of the road, and more leg room in back.	1
	also easier entry/exit.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4399#msg4399re: telescopic steering wheel [carlupi]        it's interesting to see how huynda manage different model of the genesis between canada and usa.	1
	in canada the base model come with no sunroof but the telescopic is there.	1

	as i know hyundai expect to sale only 300 to 400 in canada for the first year, i don't know the stats at the moment in canada but it seems more popular in usa, where 1 000 and more are sold per month since september.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4400#msg4400genesis coupe up close        i got to sit in the genesis coupe at the twin cities auto show yesterday.	1
	they had two 3.8s on the floor.	1
	i sat in the silver one, black interior.	1
	i was very impressed by the seat comfort, seating position, and quality feel of the controls.	1
	i was thinking, 'i have got to get me one of                 these                .'	1
	until i tried out the back seat.	1
	i am only 5'10' on tippy toes and my head was bent down to avoid the roof and rear window.	1
	since i have two teenagers still at home, no genesis coupe for me.	1
	definitely a car for people who never need to carry an adult or tall child in the back.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4401#msg4401re: genesis coupe up close [backy]        the rear set of the genesis coupe is similar to that of the g37.	1
	the rear seats in these sport coupes should be considered only useful to store small objects and for seating young children.	1
	in most situations, the genesis coupe and g37 should be considered two-seaters.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4402#msg4402re: genesis coupe up close [jpdisarro]        yeah, but i can always dream.	1
	i guess i should act my age, and social standing.	1
	the last coupe i owned, a 328ci, had decent room in back for two adults my size.	1
	but the rear window wasn't slanted at as severe an angle as on the genesis or g37 coupes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4403#msg4403re: telescopic steering wheel [carlupi]        are you sure it didn't telescope at all?	1
	the 3.8 premium plus package i tested had a manual telescoping steering wheel.	1
	maybe you needed to pull on it a little harder.	1
	i can't imagine the azera and sonata having manual telescoping steering wheels and the flagship sedan not having it at all.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4404#msg4404re: telescopic steering wheel [allmet33]        any car with a package has a power telescopic wheel.	1
	it could also work manually i suppose.	1
	but carlupi wants a base 3.8, and there is no mention of a telescopic wheel on that car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4405#msg4405re: telescopic steering wheel [backy]        yeah...going back, i see the base 3.8 only offers tilt, but you can get the premium package and it comes with the power tilt and telescoping steering wheel.	1
	for the life of me, i don't understand why someone would get a base 3.8.  for $2k more you get...                                premium package                - lexicon 14-speaker surround sound audio system w/ in-dash 6-disc cd changer                - leather-wrapped dash and door trim inserts                - power tilt-and-slide sunroof                - power tilt and telescopic steering wheel                - integrated memory system                - rain-sensing wipers                - auto-defogging windshield                - power rear sunshade                                ...and your payments may only go up $15/mo.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4407#msg4407re: telescopic steering wheel [allmet33]        there was a problem with head clearance for that poster with the moonroof, hence the desire for a telescopic steering column but no moonroof.	1
	the premium package is a good deal i think, but i don't have any problem with head clearance.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4408#msg4408re: telescopic steering wheel [backy]        i wonder how tall that person is, because i'm 6'2' and i had no issues with head clearance in the premium plus package i tested with the sunroof.	1
	sometimes i wonder if folks know the seat bottom can be lowered to create more headroom???	1
	generally, the way i set the seat up is to tilt the seat cushion with the front slightly elevated and the rear portion lowered all the way down so that my thighs are at a slight upward angle...i find this to be quite comfortable.	1
	however, i do know everyone has a different driving position that suits them.	1
	anyone over 6' tall, i can't imagine why they would need the seat cushion adjusted all the way up at it's highest point.	1
	not unless you're 4' of leg and 2' of torso and head!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4409#msg4409re: telescopic steering wheel [allmet33]        there are many people taller than 6'2'.	1
	i am seeing lots of them on cbs over the past week.	1
	also the ratio of torso-to-leg length is different on different people.	1
	someone can be 'only' 6'2' and have a long torso.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4410#msg4410re: telescopic steering wheel [backy]        oh...i'm aware that there are plenty of folks taller than 6'2', which is why i brought up the whole seat cushion adjustment.	1
	lowering it to it's lowest point gives one plenty of head room, unless you just like to sit completely upright in the straightest possible position you can find!	1
	lol       	1

	this option is for some of the guys i've been watching on tv.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4412#msg4412genesis a potential option        i will be in the market for a new 4-door sedan this coming summer.	1
	currently, i drive a 2001 lexus ls 430 which i purchased used in 2004. it has been a wonderful car; big, comfortable, powerful, and very smooth.	1
	but it is closing in on 120,000 miles and it may be time for a replacement.	1
	i recently went to the auto show here on cleveland, ohio and looked at the genesis.	1
	i liked the size and room in the rear seat, which is important to me.	1
	the interior was very nice, with the exception of the head liner which seemed a bit cheap and i liked the exterior styling.	1
	i have read all the posts in this forum and have taken note on the suspension issues that have been raised.	1
	i will reserve comment on that until i have taken an extensive test drive.	1
	i am not looking for a sedan that is a top performer in the slalom test, but one that is balanced more on the comfort side.	1
	so we will see how the test drive goes with the genesis.	1
	one concern i have with purchasing a genesis is service from the dealer.	1
	has anyone one out there had issues getting proper and courteous service from their hyundai dealers?	1
	i know it will vary from dealer to dealer, but i am curious if hyundai is trying to upgrade the dealer experience in service as well as sales for genesis owners.	1
	do dealers give you complimentary loaner cars when you genesis is in for routine service?	1
	another concern i have is with rear wheel drive cars and winter traction here in the cleveland area where we get our share of snow.	1
	obviously, my ls 430 is rear wheel drive and when i bought the car it had dunlap all season tires on it.	1
	i don't remember the specific tire model, but they were awful in the snow and in wet weather.	1
	i considered buying a set of snow tires, when a friend of mine recommended goodyear assurance triple tread all season tires.	1
	i put on a set of 4 and i must tell everyone out there that they have been great tires in the snow and rain.	1
	a significant improvement  over the dunlaps.	1
	now the triple treads will not equal a good set of snow tires, but they are a great compromise for those who don't wish to buy a separate set of snows.	1
	and i already checked, triple treads are not made in the genesis 4.6 tire size.	1
	the genesis 4.6 has a rare tire size which means expensive replacement cost when they wear out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4413#msg4413re: genesis a potential option [smarc]        have you checked                 link title                for available tire manufacturers and ratings?       	1

	if you got by with rwd on the lexus, you should get along fine with the genesis.	1
	but cleve???	1
	that's a fwd or 4wd town!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4415#msg4415re: genesis a potential option [bobad]        ls 430 is rear wheel drive and i did have trouble in light snowy conditions until i put the triple tread tires on.	1
	they greatly improved the traction.	1
	all season tires are not created equal.	1
	some are more like summer tires, others better in wet conditions.	1
	i don't go out in that car if there is 5 inches of fresh snow on the pavement, then i am asking for trouble, but one of the advantages of living in this part of the country that gets a lot of snow, is that they are good at keeping the roads clear, so in a typical winter up here, there are maybe a half dozen days per winter where i really don't drive my ls.	1
	my wife has all wheel drive suv which we can always depend on.	1
	my concern is that the tire size on the genesis 4.6 is a rare size and there are limited options for replacement.	1
	the oem tires, i believe are dunlaps, which may not be the best for winter traction among all season tires.	1
	i'd rather not have to go the snow tire route.	1
	i will have to do more research on all season tire availability for 235/50/18 size tires.       	1

	- yes, my parents have one.	1
	pretty much all the reviews (when the x3) came out talked about the overly harsh ride (not the same as the sedan).	1
	while bmw has softened the tuning a bit over the years, even reviews today talk about the uncomfortable ride.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4418#msg4418re: genesis a potential option [smarc]        bonjour smarc,                                last november genesis was a potential option, and because of a lack of information on how this car will behave on snow i decide to wait until tomorrow to be a new owner of a 3.8. i have read all the posts in this forum and have taken note on the suspension issues that have been raised.	1
	after my roadtest i decide to accept the hard ride of the genesis, compare to the es350 of lexus where the suspension was to soft.	1
	i am from quebec city were snow is omnipresent 4-5 months per year.	1
	so by experience traction is easier than propulsion during winter time, but i remember my father during the 1970 (on winter 2 bags of sand was in the trunk).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4424#msg4424re: genesis a rough ride indeed [jyym]        then we will have to agree that one man's harsh/firm ride is another man's floaty ride.	1
	why would your parents buy a car when they didn't like the ride on the test drives?	1
	or is is just you that doesn't like the ride?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4425#msg4425re: genesis a rough ride indeed [kdshapiro]        well i can agree w/ that to a certain extent (for instance, some people find the genesis sedan's ride to be too firm, others, not firm enough) - but i think i know the difference btwn a 'firm' ride and a 'harsh, jittery' ride - considering that i have a long experience w/ bmws and porsches.	1
	and it's not just me, pretty much every professional auto reviewer has commented on the x3's harsh ride - even those across the pond such as the guys on top gear.	1
	my parents were in a hurry to replace their 3 series that was damaged in an accident so they didn't take a thorough test drive since they figured the ride would be similar to their bmws (a 3 and 5).	1
	so are you going to also argue that the interior of the x3 (esp.	1
	the earlier models) wasn't chinzy for a near $40k car?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4426#msg4426ride problems        i think the root of the debate about the genesis ride quality comes down to one word.	1
	'problem.'	1
	whether you like a firm ride or a soft ride, the genesis ride is what it is.	1
	it's not a 'problem' with the car, it's a 'characteristic' of the car.	1
	saying the genesis has a 'suspension problem' is just plain wrong, and going back and forth debating the suspension tuning is a waste of time.	1
	harshness, firmness, stiffness, etc.	1
	are all very subjective.	1
	sometimes, a harsh ride can be fixed with different tires (remember, when bmw first switched to run-flats, there were many complaints of harshness - it's taken a few years for bmw to tweak it's tires/suspension settings).	1
	i've driven the genesis 3.8, and i found the ride more than acceptable.	1
	yes, it lacked the nth degree of refinement of a bmw or lexus, however, it was still pleasing.	1
	i also really like the cabin (except for the 'headlights on' indicator light) and i think the exterior styling is nice (if somewhat anonymous).	1
	some folks like a flaccid lexus ride, some prefer a firm bmw ride.	1
	i think the genesis ride is somewhere in between (though i agree some harshness does sneak through - it's more like a hushed honda).	1
	overall though, i was very impressed with the car - for about $30,000, i think it's a heck of a lot of car for the money.	1
	you get luxury trappings, features, and build quality with a ride that's perfectly acceptable (though more family car than luxury car).	1
	actually, i guess that's how i personally characterize the genesis - it's not a bottom-tier luxury car (competing with lexus and bmw), it's a 'tweener car' that sits above the accord/camry/maxima.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4427#msg4427re: genesis a rough ride indeed [jyym]        we are not discussing the interior.	1
	we discussing opinions and more opinons on the ride.	1
	while i do agree as fed said, bmw has been tweaking their suspensions for the last upteem years with the r/f tires, i have yet to see any widespread credible reviews as you describe for us spec models.	1
	now if you weren't talking us spec that may be another issue.	1
	after driving every late model bmw made except the 760 and alpina, m5 and some other top of the line models, such as the z8 and comparing them, the x3 does not have a jittery ride imo as you describe.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4428#msg4428re: genesis a rough ride indeed [kdshapiro]         we are not discussing the interior.	1
	i believe we are free to discuss any issues with these autos.	1
	i also think the x3 has a cheap looking interior and the ride is like a buckboard.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4431#msg4431re: genesis a rough ride indeed [tenpin288]        i agree with you.	1

	i'm considering one.	1
	so, i happened over here, and find a couple of people don't like the way it rides.	1
	a little shocked by that.	1
	but, i suppose it's all about perception.	1
	if you're looking for that lexus type, buick type, town car type of ride, you might be disappointed.	1
	but to say it's harsh?	1
	i don't get that impression, at all.	1
	it is controlled, however.	1
	matter of fact, i was surprised at how well it handled (and rode) given the size of the car.	1
	matter of fact, the ride did remind me of a bmw i had a few years ago.	1
	it probably is more closely related to that 'ride quality'.	1
	if you don't like that sort of ride, you might be disappointed.	1
	if you think it's harsh, then you're looking at the wrong type of car.	1
	i'd wander over to the lexus or buick store, if that's the case.	1
	as far as the rest of the car, it's impressive....features, build quality, quality of materials, performance, (and i've only driven a v6), etc are pretty much the equal (sometimes exceed) the lux/sports models from traditional manufacturers.	1
	throw in the price that these are selling for, and i believe there are some well regarded german and japanese manufacturers who should be very worried.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4435#msg4435re: genesis vs cts [ergsum]        thanks for posting the comparo.	1
	i did my own head-to-head comparo of the genesis 3.8 vs. the cts last august, but i drove a more loaded cts (provided by hyundai) that included nav among other add-ons, and listed for over $50k.	1
	my experience echoes that of the edmunds' crew, except i found that the cts gave up earlier on sharp turns (through a tight figure-s course) than did the genesis.	1
	the cts tended to plow ahead on those, while the genesis was more glued to the road and allowed me to zip through the course faster and with less drama than with the cts.	1
	personally i prefer the styling of the genesis to the sharp-edged cts.	1
	that styling trend from cadillac never grew on me.	1
	the edmunds' reviewers liked it better than the genesis' smoother, more traditional lines though.	1
	to each his own on styling.	1
	even though some including edmunds have compared the genesis to the cts, and in fact hyundai itself dared shoppers to compare the two in its genesis test drive events last year, i don't think it's a very good comparison.	1
	i think the cts matches up better with smaller cars like the 3 series, maybe the 5 series.	1
	the natural competition for the genesis in the luxury class is i think bigger cars like the dts, and the gs and ls.	1
	and also sedans like the mks, 300c, and s80.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4436#msg4436re: genesis vs cts [backy]        agreed on the genesis vs cts.	1
	maybe an sts.	1
	i've never driven a cts.	1
	a colleague has one, though.	1
	pretty car, no doubt.	1
	i've been in his several times, but only as a passenger.	1
	i also think the cts is more of a competitor to the 3 series, g, tl, etc.	1
	comparo was pretty much dead on.	1
	i kind of slot the ride of the genesis to split the difference between an infinit m/cts and a bmw 3 or 5.                                i do wish i could find a v8 to test drive, though.	1
	aside from the 'loadedness' or performance of a genensis (didn't know a v6 would yield 6.5 secs), street prices of a v6 tech is a hair over $36k.	1
	v8 w/tech somewhere in the $38k plus a bit.	1
	load up a cts, an m, a 3 or 5 series like for like, the price discrepancy is going to be pretty large.	1
	for a genesis that performs so closely to the others, with the build, quality of materials, features, it's a very compelling package.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4437#msg4437re: genesis a rough ride indeed [kdshapiro]         you ... are certainly entitled to your opinion, just as carolinabob is entitled to his.	1

	you and carolinabob would certainly like to turn every hyundai forum into a hyundai bashing lollapalooza, but that won't happen.	1
	some of us want to hear all types of information on the genesis, not just your one-sided conjecture.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4438#msg443820,000 mile update (loaded black/black  3.8)        at about every 5,000 miles, i have posted my impressions.	1
	here goes my experiences at 20,000 miles:                                1.  fit, finish, etc.	1
	is outstanding.	1
	not a squeak, rattle or vibration.	1
	2.  curvature of rocker panel near rear wheel opening tends to collect road spray which does not do the paint any favors.	1
	my car has mud guards, which may come in to play aerodynamically.	1
	3.  interior (seats, etc.)	1
	still look new.	1
	comfortable seats with texture that holds you in place during cornering, etc.	1
	4.  small but strange glitch in the nav/traffic system.	1
	about half the time when the traffic notification appears, as i work through the menu and select a particular accident, it brings up what i would call upside-down information.	1
	it will indicate that the accident is south of my current location and it gives the specific location (highway, mile marker, intersection, etc.)	1
	which i know for absolute certainty is to the north of my current location.	1
	it does not do this every time but it is frequent.	1
	i have no way of knowing if my nav system is the culprit or if the problem is in the police/highway department system.	1
	the strange thing is that the arrow always points in the correct direction of the accident.	1
	5.  i still think this engine/transmission combo is as good as it gets for a six cylinder lugging around a large sedan.	1
	i have driven the 4.6 eight and was surprised at how little difference i felt.	1
	yes, the eight pulls away at 80mph and above but there is little to no difference from zero to 60 or in any kind of normal driving.	1
	i would have opted for the eight cylinder but it had not been introduced when i bought mine.	1
	6.  great fuel mileage on trips as long as i can find gas with no ethanol.	1
	i consistently get 27 to 29 mpg and i drive 85 mph where possible.	1
	i get at least 2 mpg less with fuel containing ethanol.	1
	7.  lets cut through all the crap going back and forth regarding the suspension!	1
	in hyundais efforts to make the car both sporty and luxurious, they missed the mark on both.	1
	it corners great and it is a dream to drive on well paved surfaces.	1
	however, on streets or roads that have bumps, holes, or undulations, it is too stiff and transmits too much of the stiffness to the passengers.	1
	dont even consider overinflating the tires!	1
	my previous four cars were the mercedes e class, acura tl, bmw 5 series, and a lexus ls.	1
	for my taste, bmw hit the mark dead-on for being both sporty and pleasant on any surface.	1
	now  at the risk of being accused of speaking out of both sides of my mouth, i like the genesis anyway because i am a high-mileage driver and 90% of my travel is on reasonably good roads.	1
	as a matter of fact, i love traveling in this thing!	1
	8.  no more battery drain problems since they found the hood switch out of position (see my previous posts).	1
	9.  the best sound system ever!	1
	great navigation system.	1
	very well thought out instrument toggle control (much better than bmws i-drive).	1
	10.  tires are performing and wearing great.	1
	it looks like i could easily achieve 40,000 miles on them but i probably will swap them out at 30k because i am so anal.	1
	sorry for the length of this post but i have tried in all my posts to give my real-world genesis experience rather than using this forum to have a running battle with the same three or four bloggers that obviously have more time to kill than i do.	1
	however, since i have about as much seat-time in a genesis as anyone, i will be happy to field any questions that serious participants may have.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4439#msg4439re: 20,000 mile update (loaded black/black  3.8) [colegar]        colegar, glad to see you're racking up the miles and still enjoying your genesis!!!	1
	honestly, on your reviews that you've posted...i would make a genesis my next sedan.	1
	i just have to convince the wife that giving up my azera would be worth it!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4441#msg4441allmet...        ahh, the ever-financially-reasonable women in our lives.	1
	i'm still taking flak from my wife for trading in our '01 kia sportage 4x4 for a 2008 mitsubishi lancer gts, that happening in march of '07!	1
	i love the lancer gts, it's a great car and it's looks still send shivers down my spine.	1
	but it's the money...she wanted to add another 100,000 miles on the sportage 4x4.	1
	it had 130,000 miles on it and it was a great small suv to own and operate.	1
	we only had 2 payments left on it, too!	1
	things may go differently with the lancer gts, i mean, we may run this compact sedan for another 200,000 miles, i'm getting the feeling.	1
	are you thinking new genesis sedan, allmet33?	1
	it looks like a winning large rwd sedan so far, and the new genesis coupe looks like it will be a winner, too.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4444#msg4444re: re motor trend march 31 newsletter [dborth]        yeah, b/c comparing a 2+2 touring coupe w/ a 2 seat sports car and a muscle car w/ a v-8 makes so much sense.	1
	in that case, so should the g37 and mazda rx-8 (esp.	1
	the rx-8 w/ a 7.0s 0-60 time), as well as the v-6 'stang.       	1

	the one glaring difference between the genesis coupe and mustang gt/370z, would be the $4k-$8k price advantage the genesis coupe holds over both cars.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4447#msg4447re: 20,000 mile update (loaded black/black  3.8) [colegar]        i appreciate the information greatly.	1
	i am at a stand still deciding between a maxima, genesis,  cts.	1
	your post definitely makes me lean towards the genesis.	1
	i have some questions does it seem the suspension has 'softened up' with the increase in miles driven?	1
	the second you mention you get better mileage when the gas doesn't include ethanol which gas doesn't include it and major brand?	1
	the mileage is all highway?	1
	i drive 25k plus per year but alot of it is blended about 70% highway 30 in town i could only avg.	1
	26 with my 4cyl altima which was somewhat disappointing.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4448#msg4448re: 20,000 mile update (loaded black/black  3.8) [nissanou812]        replying to nissanou812                                if i were making that decision, i wiould still go with the genesis even though my posts have included some criticisms along with several kudos.	1
	i think the genesis offers a lot of car for the money.	1
	no, the suspension has not changed characteristics as the miles stack up.	1
	if you put 25k per year, you are also a fairly high-mileage owner and you must be doing a significant amount of highway driving.	1
	even in town, the genesis is still great to get around in so long as you know that a few streets are going to transmit a very firm ride.	1
	and this may not be very convincing, but you do become 'conditioned' to the firm ride to a large degree until you rent a soft-riding car and then crawl back into the genesis.	1
	remember to keep the tire pressure at factory specs and no more!	1
	regarding ethanol vs 'real' gas, i have found that even in the same area, some stations of the same brand do not always have the same blend.	1
	you will find that it is very hard to find pure gasoline in some states.	1
	i visited my daughter in stafford, va and never did find gas without ethanol.	1
	i use gas from costco which is normally priced well and contains no ethanol (at least where i live).	1
	the genesis will not quite achieve the 26 mpg overall average of your altama unless you are mostly on the highway but i don't know of anything its size or quality that will beat it except for the mercedes e320 cdi (diesel) i had, which was phenominal.	1
	hope this helps!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4449#msg4449march 2009 sales        hyundai sold over 1600 geneses in u.s. for march '09 (equates to just under 20,000 a year).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4452#msg4452function easy access        bonjour,                                after reading the user guide of my genesis, i notice that the function 'easy access' doesn't work properly.	1
	the user guide said ; when you turn off the engine, the driver seat should go back, and the stearing should move away from the driver.	1
	these two(2) functions should operate once the engine is turn off.	1
	well, in my case only the stearing move away.	1
	the driver doesn't move.	1
	i check with hyunda-canada, and they don't understand what is my problem.	1
	i check with the dealer and i have to see a technician.	1
	i don't have the navigation system, so i cannot see on the car settings options if they are on or off.	1
	is someboby has this problem, is the user guide is correct ?	1
	dsol pour mon anglais.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4453#msg4453re: function easy access [gensiscan]         the driver doesn't move                                is the seat already all the way back?	1
	in cars with this feature if the seat is already back all the way there is nothing else for the system to do.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4454#msg4454re: function easy access [tjc78]         seat                oups....                                the driver seat doesn't move....                                in my case the driver seat is not all the way back.	1
	but i did the test by moving the driver seat as forward as possible, and breathing started to be non natural... so at that position i turn off the engine, and only the steering-wheel moved away.	1
	the driver seat stayed at the same place.	1
	my concern is the user guide, it said, the driver seat (page 4-34, 4-35 by memory) should move away, same as the steering.	1
	so maybe the user guide is not correct ??	1
	in my case this the way the car acted when i turn off the engine.	1
	i can live with that, but actually with my knee problem is something i am missing.	1
	i ca       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4455#msg4455re: function easy access [gensiscan]        i think your vehicle definietly has a malfunction.	1
	i have mine set for easy access and both the driver's seat and stearing wheel move out of the way when i turn the ignition off.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4456#msg4456re: function easy access [gensiscan]        nope, there's no malfunction with your car.	1
	it is just that an option needs to be turned on in your car's computer.	1
	unfortunately, it needs to be done at the dealer as it needs a proprietory handheld computer available only at hyundai dealers.	1
	my azera also had the easy exit disabled.	1
	wen to the dealer, he attached a scanner/handheld unit, waded through the menus  turned on 'easy exit'.	1
	simple.	1
	considering the level of knowledge of a typical hyundai service department however, they may say there's nothing like it.	1
	don't believe them.	1
	persist with them or go to another competent dealer.	1
	good luck!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4457#msg4457poor ride quality in genesis?	1
	i don't really have a dog in this fight but i just read yesterday a reviewer's analysis of the genesis sedan and it supported several of the (dissenting) opinions here about the jittery ride of the genesis over poor road surfaces.	1
	i think it was a blurb in the latest automobile mag.	1
	(or maybe motor trend).	1
	if hyundai works this suspension problem out - they will have a real winner on their hands (not that its chopped liver now, though...).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4458#msg4458re: poor ride quality in genesis?	1
	[johnxyz]        johnny, didn't you cross the genesis off your list a long time ago?	1
	here's one of your posts from back in february:                                 oh well, strike the hyundai genesis off my shopping list!	1
	the primitive suspension and subpar seats mentioned above were enough to dis-suade me.	1
	shoot - and i was hopeful for the genesis.	1
	unfortunately i can't wait until a new model or even a mid-model refresh (to address these 2 qc/design issues) to come out before i buy.	1
	back to toyota  honda.	1
	back again, to convince us of how sub-par the genesis is?	1
	and where are these 'several opinions' about the genesis' ride?	1
	all i've seen are the same people repeatedly posting the same garbage in different forums.	1
	are those the opinions you're referring to?	1
	please.	1

	[johnxyz]        johnxyz -                                don't let the paranoid bullies chase you away like they have everyone else.	1
	they find it easier to imagine nefarious plots rather than admit that some people have had a complaint or concern with the ride of the genesis.	1
	they also can't read or hold more than one piece of info in their brains at a time.	1
	there are indeed several people who have made many posts (it's called a dialouge), but there are also many individual comments about suspension concerns - many people only posted once or twice until the bullies drove them away or they got their questions answered and moved on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4461#msg4461the ride is fine        time to wade in here!	1
	i have had my genesis since last august and, yes, the ride is a little stiffer then the infinti q45 or the lexus ls400 that i have previously driven but certainly not unbearable.	1
	i don't know for sure but the ride is probably more like the other 'sports' sedans being sold by bmw or mercedes.	1
	based on value this car is perfect.	1
	it was $20,000 less then the q45 but actually bigger on the inside in every way.	1
	couple this with the fantastic warranty and you can not go wrong buying this car.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4462#msg4462re: the ride is fine [sheltonzz]        no one denies your great experience and we are jealous believe me.	1
	the concern is not about a little stiffness in the ride.	1
	some people have had a vastly different experience - that doesn't negate your experience and your experience does not negate ours.	1
	there is clearly variablity in the vehicles.	1
	the issue has popped up often enough that something is/was going on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4463#msg4463mee too...        sheltonzz,                                i feel the same way...i think the car is perfect...at least for me.	1
	i got my genesis v8/tech almost 2 weeks ago and am thrilled to death of it!	1
	i traded my azera for it.	1
	yes the suspension is stiffer but it's a good stiff and to me is sporty!	1
	it handles really well in curves and turns and performance is awesome.	1
	i also keep telling my wife it's got too much power.	1
	boy this car can move!	1
	if i had to find something wrong about this car to me it's the tire noise!	1
	the dunlops aren't very good tires imo.	1
	the mileage you get on the freeway is awesome...i average anywhere between 27 - 29 mpg.	1
	city driving is another story, between 16 - 18 mpg.	1
	overall i'd say that's pretty dam good considering it being a v8.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4466#msg4466re: mee too... [johnnw]        i didn't say anything about the suspension, my comment was regarding the fuel economy.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4467#msg4467re: the ride is fine [johnnw]         the issue has popped up often enough that something is/was going on.	1
	the issue has popped up often because 1 fellow brought it up a hundred times all over the internet.	1
	1 problem reported 100 times is not as significant as 100 problems brought up 1 time.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4468#msg4468re: the ride is fine [bobad]        so...is it still significant if the single problem has been brought up 100 times by a single person???	1
	the ultimate significance would be if 100 people brought up the same single issue 100 times.	1
	the internet allows one to be quite ubiquitous, which would make a single issue seem grander than it truly is.       	1

	i used this website to do it for me.	1
	http://www.eforecourt.com/l_100km_mpg_convert.htm                                btw...i set the cruise at 118km or 73.33mph when i cruise on the highway.	1
	regards,                                ps...i love my car!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4474#msg4474my first close up view of genesis        i parked next to a really handsome car today (turquise or light metallice blue color).	1
	initially i thought it was some new infiniti or lexus or bmw, but the wing-looking emblem had me thinking it was a chrysler.	1
	only a close up look did i see 'genesis' on the emblem.	1
	what a nice looking car, and really luxurious, warm looking interior.	1
	definitely worthy of a look for my next car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4475#msg4475re: oh well... [sergio19]        i, for one, believe your mpg numbers because i get similar results (or better) all the time and i am at 21,000 miles on the odometer.	1
	to get that mileae, i don't have to use crazy coasting techniques or drive 55 mph.	1
	i can get the epa rating of 27 mpg on any trip except one that had me driving into sustained 30 mph headwinds.	1
	for those of you who think i must be exagerating, take a look at my previous posts and you will see that i do not shy away from a few criticisms of the genesis.	1
	however, you will see that i have consistently praised the performance of the 3.8 engine mated to the slick-shifting six speed, both for its quickness and for its gas mileage.       	1

	merci        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4477#msg4477re: oh well... [sergio19]        bonjour,                                i am very impress by the fuel economy of the v8.	1
	just for comparaison, i have a v6, and at 118km (2000 rpm) to cover 250km (mtl to quebec city)...i got a 7.9l / 100km.	1
	i was not all the time on the cruise control, but still, a v8 with 8.2l/100km is very impressive or 'remarquable'                                just for information, what was your rpm ??	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4478#msg4478re: the ride is fine [bobad]        sorry - you are wrong.	1
	you need to separate dialouge and sheer number of posts from postings from different individuals.	1
	across message boards (especially early on) there are numerous postings from different individuals (and reviewers btw).	1
	for my negotiation with hyundai i myself collected 75 individual complaints about suspension issues.	1
	in all fairness, these did include five private emails sent to me and not posted on a message board.	1
	now, 75 complaints in the grand scheme of the number of genny's sold is not a lot.	1
	however, we have no idea how many have a concern and never post and vica versa.	1
	so, there may be only a small percentage of people unhappy enough to post or trade their vehicle or what not - but, please do not keep pretending that it's only one person or no one has a problem because that is simply not true.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4479#msg4479re: the ride is fine [johnnw]         but, please do not keep pretending that it's only one person or no one has a problem because that is simply not true.	1
	never said that, and you know i never said that.	1
	all i'm saying is that 1 obsessed or disgruntled person                  who does not even own a genesis                 can badly skew google search results.	1
	try it!	1
	do a search on 'genesis suspension problems', and tell me how many of the first 10 hits are complaints (or linked to complaints) by a non-genesis owner.	1
	the average car shopper who does a superficial google search can be badly misled.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4480#msg4480re: the ride is fine [bobad]        i can see your point.	1
	i'd say though that that is no reason for people not post as much as they want.	1
	conversely, people posting over and over about their great, buttery smooth ride or such (which i unfortunately have never experienced in my purchased vehicle) can skew search results as well.	1
	no one has an obligation to genesis or hyundai to worry about google search results.	1
	i'd hope any potential buyer would ultimately do more than a superficial search.	1
	personally - i'm more upset about the fact that hyundai promised me a state of the art, advanced suspension with a smooth, yet sporty ride yet sold me a car that rode like an old truck with no shocks 90% of the time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4481#msg4481re: the ride is fine [johnnw]        you know...one can read as many posts as they want to read (good or bad), but the only way anyone will find out how the car will feel to them is to go put their butt in the driver's seat and take it for a test drive.	1
	don't get me wrong, i can appreciate the feedback positive or negative from those who have actually experienced the car for themselves, but there are just too many that will simply jump on a bandwagon and say things based on what they've read or heard from somewhere else and honestly...don't have a clue.	1
	those the ones that truly skew the searches when it comes to find out info on a particular vehicle.       	1

	for the v6 without many options your statement may be accurate.	1
	but for a loaded v8 trim genesis i would completely disagree with you, it is not a bottom tier luxury car and certainly not a family car thats sitting just above an accord.	1
	based purely on features, quality of components, build quality and preformance documented through multiple road tests including 0-60, 1/4 mile, braking, slalom, wet handling, dry handling, etc it is in a very exclusive league occupied by v8 bmw's,  audi's or benz's.	1
	the suspension is not a problem, it is one of the strong features of the genesis and is matched very well with the tau engine and zf transmission.	1

	it has even turned up from genesis owners on the hyundai think tank.	1
	latest was just this past week:                automobile magazine, may 2009:  comments on                 their                4.6 at 1156 miles.	1
	marc noordelos, road test editor: 'hyundai needs to revisit the genesis suspension tuning.	1

	what it means is that each person needs to carefully analyze the ride over several types of surfaces for at least a couple of hours of driving.	1

	i guess it depends on how you define luxury.	1
	in my opinion, while it's true that the v8 genesis has more luxury features and a more powerful engine than the v6, i don't think 'luxury' is defined by bells and whistles.	1
	the genesis platform is a fine foundation for an upscale family car, but it is what it is - whether it's dressed in khakis and a polo shirt or a tuxedo.	1
	it's a fantastic car that i like very much, but i still say that for the genesis (in any trim) to truly belong in the luxury market, it needs that final nth of a degree of driveline and suspension polish and refinement that only the europeans possess (no, lexus isn't there either).	1
	in my opinion, a base mercedes or bmw with a cassette deck and vinyl seats is more of a 'luxury' car than any current leather-clad, bejeweled beauty from asia.	1
	you may not think so sitting in the parking lot, but put the cars in motion and the difference is clear.       	1

	this is a layman feedback group, not a techno-weenie one.	1
	which is probably for the best.	1
	probably 95% of luxury car owners are in that category.	1
	they just drive the car, and want something posh and comfortable, quiet and reliable, with great convenience and safety features.	1
	if the techno guys get too much input on the car's design and features, you end up with a car which many of the features are superfluous or even unwanted by most prospective customers.	1
	for example, most of us wouldn't want rough riding 20' wheels, a whining limited slip differential, and a 100# subwoofer in the trunk.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4543#msg4543re: the ride is fine [bobad]        good point.	1

	i'll bet the 'techno-weenies' would drool over the technical specs of the genesis' suspension (cf.	1
	the raves that c/d made about the technical specs of the suspension, how advanced its design is etc.).	1
	but real-world performance is another matter.	1
	it is clear at least some percentage of genesis owners and test-drivers don't find the genesis' ride quality to their liking.	1
	so hyundai needs to get input from the 'average joe/jane' luxury car buyer on aspects like that as well as from technical experts.       	1

	true!	1
	however, over the years, pollsters and statisticians have found that well over 10% of all people like absolutely nothing.	1
	i guess that puts genesis squarely under the positive side of the curve.	1
	however, there is always room for improvement.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4560#msg4560re: ride problem does exist [houdini1]        the interesting thing about the ride quality comments is that one editor said the ride was 'appalling', another 'very harsh for a luxury car', and yet another 'about average'.	1
	and several editors didn't mention the ride quality at all.	1
	then at the end was the comment about the snow tires and its possible detriment to ride quality.	1
	maybe it comes down to the driver's expectations of what the ride of a v8 luxury sedan should feel like?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4564#msg4564re: 'genesis emblem' [espo35]        thanks for the post, i will look into it, about how much did you pay for it?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4565#msg4565re: ride problem does exist [backy]        also there is something else to consider.	1
	some of these publications are no better or no worse that newspapers today.	1
	some of them are biased, some have their own agenda and some want to protect their turf.	1
	in recent years i have seen some otherwise well respected mags attempt to do obvious hatchet jobs on various autos, so i always take what i read with a grain of salt.	1
	there is still no substitute for driving any car that you are interested in for yourself and making up your own mind.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4566#msg4566re: ride problem does exist [mellonc]        mellonc:                welcome to the fray.	1
	for certain members, any criticism of the genesis or any hyundai for that matter is wrong.	1
	i have copied at least 5 professional reviews of the genesis where the ride/suspension is questioned.	1
	there are also multiple posts on this forum and others from owners and those that have tested it.	1
	even consumer reports in their report ranking it 1st in its class commented negatively on the v-6's ride 3 times.	1
	re: bias; auto magazines and websites have been accused of being overly favorable in their reviews, not overly critical.	1
	after all, they make almost 100% of their income from advertising.	1
	subscribtions and over the counter sales barely pay postage/shipping costs, if that.	1
	snow tires would not cause most of the ride problems that are indicated in the reviews, but might cause some.	1
	regardless, the reviews i have read tested them with standard tires.	1
	there is some question that the 18' wheels and the v-8 do ride worse than the v-6.	1
	everyone should test drive the car over several different road surfaces and for up to one hour if necessary.	1
	test more than one car if possible.	1
	i have driven 2 v-6's and a v-8 and noted ride issues on short test runs.	1
	concern for me is how the car will hold up as this became a problem in azeras as they exceeded about 1,000 miles.	1
	enough of a problem that hyundai replaced shock absorbers up to twice without question - and it was due to ride, not noise in many cases.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4567#msg4567re: ride problem does exist [carolinabob]        bob:                                i see your point.	1
	i guess once people own the car they don't really want to hear bad things about the car.... human psychology i suppose....                                to everyone else:                                i called my grad school buddy who was/is at ford (he is still there!).	1
	he's been involved with suspension parts design and, yes, sadly, outsourcing, and project financing for quite some time since the early 90's.	1
	he was also instrumental in working with mazda mx-6 and ford probe collaboration with the japanese team as well.	1
	to make a long story short, this is not an easy fix, according to him.	1
	let me explain, to control the handling of a car you have a number of variables you can tighten: 1) springs 2) shocks 3) roll bars 4) bushings 5) other miscellaneous stuff like alignment has minimal effect on over quality of 'ride' vs'control'.	1
	we all want buick soft ride when going over bumps on the road but m3 like handling when it comes to attacking corners.	1
	in other words, best of both worlds - at least i do.	1
	this, of course, is impossible to achieve in a road going car.	1
	the germans make the compromise between ride and handling work by building in stiff shocks, good weight distribution, plenty of wheel travel and careful tweaking of the roll bars.	1
	the difference between bmw and mb isn't that much, however.	1
	bmw has had similar set up with mb's for a long time but their advantage has always been in smaller size.	1
	if you do a comparison between the size of wheel bases and overall dimensions that extend beyond the wheelbase on both cars bmw always comes out smaller in every aspect.	1
	thus, even with more handling biased set up, bmw always seems like it's a better trade off between ride and handling than does an mb.	1
	once the body is built and wheelbases set on the car, and all the weighty parts are bolted to the frame, there is only so much we can do with 1,2,3,and 4 mentioned above.	1
	furthermore, the overall dynamics of the car starts changing rapidly once you start to introduce a few bumps along a smooth paved road.	1
	suspension teams use loads and loads of data and work on huge optimization equation to figure out what settings to change and what geometry might work the best based on cost/benefit.	1
	this process is much easier, however, if you have a huge amounts of racing data, suspension development history, abundant source of third party suppliers and network of salvaged/used parts that show wear data on existing suspension parts.	1
	i actually had a mazda mx-6 in my twenty's and can tell you that it had one of the best handling biased set-ups (even if it's a front wheeler) but it had short wheel travel that upset the suspension whenever i hit a small pothole and the body had flexible c pillars that absorbed road shocks (read: that's not good).	1
	toyota avoided this whole trouble by going the buick route ('soft') when ls400 was first introduced in the us.	1
	a smart decision given that they had no other data points to be daring.	1
	however, toyota is getting more aggressive in the us racing circuit and is beginning to put forth more aggressive suspension and body designs - try driving the touring suspension ls460.	1
	hyundai's got a long while to go.	1
	i drove my uncle's korean version of the genesis all over cheju island in south korea when i was visiting and it was a carbon copy of the es350- soft suspension with no ride problems whatsoever.	1
	when pushed hard, the front side pushed out ever so predictably only to surprise me with oversteer when i jabbed the gas pedal hard.	1
	of course, they sitffened up everything for the us market.	1
	why?	1
	it had to beat certain benchmarks like max g force and slalom times.	1
	ditto for 0 to 60.  otherwise, how can you make a marketing push with an ordinary car?	1
	just so you know what i mean by 'good handling' - my favorite handling cars that i've actually owned or have driven extensively as a reference point are (from stiff to soft): 3 series sport models (can't afford the m3), honda prelude, honda accord and mb e class.	1
	ps.	1
	yes, a family member does own a us spec genesis, and i've driven it a long time.	1
	and yes, i am a mechanical engineer by training...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4568#msg4568re: ride problem does exist [mellonc]        i'm primarily interested in genesis.	1
	how do other large genesis-sized cars, such as 7 series bmw's, get that perfect compromise between handling and ride?	1
	whether they use active suspension or careful geometry tweaking, it works doesn't it?	1
	if bmw can do it, genesis, or anyone else can do it, right?	1
	thanks,,,                                bob a.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4569#msg4569re: ride problem does exist [mellonc]        maybe hyundai could look into using an adaptive air ride suspension like that found in the audi a8.	1
	stiffens when pushed and softens when cruising and still has driver adjustable settings for various conditions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4570#msg4570re: ride problem does exist [allmet33]        allmet,                isn't that what the lexus gs 350 has?	1
	from what i have read, it does not seem to do very well on either performance or luxury (soft) settings.	1
	also, i thought the sachs system in genesis was supposed to measure the road surface and then adjust.	1
	at least, that is what the brochures says it does.	1
	it also says this is comparable system to lexus, mb and bmw.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4571#msg4571re: ride problem does exist [carolinabob]        well...comparing the suspension of a japanese vehicle to that of anything european is, well...unfair.	1
	the system on the gs only changes damping characteristics of the suspension while the system on the audi is an air bag suspension that adjusts more than one factor, even changing ride height over rough roads or snow covered surfaces.	1
	maybe both japanese and korean makers need to look at european suspensions to get a clue.	1
	i remember when lotus used to be behind a lot of suspension tuning for other makes, maybe they could bring them on board to help them out.	1
	i never really heard many complaints about lotus tuned suspensions.	1
	the sachs system may do what it's supposed to do, but if the ride quality spectrum settings are narrow, then it won't make that big of a difference.	1
	while it may be comparable to what is on lexus vehicles, to say it's comparable to bmw and benz...well, i think we can agree it's not quite on par with those makes.	1
	heck, lexus isn't even on par with those makes.	1
	personally, i feel the suspension of the genesis is on par with the likes of lexus and infiniti vehicles.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4572#msg4572re: ride problem does exist [allmet33]         heck, lexus isn't even on par with those makes.	1
	it depends what the driver is looking for....  if a soft supple ride is what you are looking for the lexus ls is about the best in the biz!	1
	as for the genesis, when i test drove it the ride felt very controlled and the handling was nice.	1
	i intend in the next week or two to be hittin' the pavement to replace my '06 avalon.	1
	the genesis is at the top of the short list (g8, max, es).	1
	however, i must admit that i will need a pretty thorough (second) test drive as the comments on the ride do have me worried.	1
	i didn't experience anything negative on my test drive but it was on a very smooth test track.	1
	on some rough roads, i'll know pretty fast if the ride suits me.	1
	which is really all that matters, not what someone in a forum or magazine editor says        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4573#msg4573re: ride problem does exist [tjc78]         it depends what the driver is looking for.... if a soft supple ride is what you are looking for the lexus ls is about the best in the biz!	1
	right, but i was talking about when comparing in terms of performance.	1
	the only lexus vehicle that would stand up to a bmw in terms of handling performance is the new is-f.                                i would really be interested in hearing your opinion if you were able to drive all cars in your list over the same roads so you can not only give feedback, but offer comparitive info.	1
	when i tested a genesis 3.8, it was on city streets.	1
	not perfectly smooth, but not pot hole ravaged either.	1
	it was typical with varied undulations, man-hole covers that sit a bit lower than the road surface, brick cross-walks and stuff like that.	1
	i also didn't get to take the car above 50 mph either, but the ride i experienced was very controlled and compliant over all surfaces encountered.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4574#msg4574re: ride problem does exist [allmet33]         i would really be interested in hearing your opinion if you were able to drive all cars in your list over the same roads                                probably couldn't do that as the dealers aren't all that close.	1
	i'll most likely be comparing the genesis to my avalon.	1
	the es is a virtual clone of the avalon ride (soft) and the max and g8 are pretty much only a 'last resort' as the g8 is practically unleaseable and only comes with black interior and the max is a bit tight for me and imo really a tough sell for 5 - 6k more than the altima.	1
	i do prefer a softer ride so the as long as the genesis isn't too firm / poorly riding over imperfections, and i can work out a good lease i may very well pull the trigger in the next month.	1
	my current ride is due back in june.	1
	i have to say the genesis is just one heck of a package.	1
	i have owned three toyotas in a row and really am surprised to be considering a hyundai, however, in driving my gfs 08 elantra i can say that my opinion has changed.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4575#msg4575re: ride problem does exist [allmet33]        that is very similar to my experience when i test drove the genesis.	1
	very smooth and supple.	1
	some back streets at low speeds and freeway upwards of 75 mph.	1
	no harshness at all but fairly smooth roads.	1
	a compromise between lexus (ls) and bmw, leaning toward lexus.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4576#msg4576re: ride problem does exist [tjc78]        tjc78...if you're looking for the softer ride, the g8 and max would definitely be out as they are tuned for a more athletic ride for sure!	1
	well...don't get all your ideas of what a hyundai truly is based on the elantra.	1
	i mean...if you had gone back and driven an elantra of the mid-late 90's and compared it to the '08, it would be like night and day.	1
	going from my '02 sonata to my '06 azera was an upgrade and driving the genesis, in comparison to my azera, even more of an upgrade.	1
	so please realize as you go up the model tree, it does get better.       	1

	i almost know that i either want the genesis or the es.	1
	i would buy another avalon in a heartbeat, however, the '09 is virtually unchanged and after 3 yotas its time to move on.	1
	the es is imo a beautiful car and very similar to the avalon except being a bit smaller in the back seat.	1
	as has been stated before the genesis is absolutely the 'value' champ, and is more the size of my avalon.	1
	i am considering the 3.8 w/ premium.	1
	don't care for the 18' wheels and 4k for the tech package is a bit much.	1
	i do wish they had the xenons as a standalone option.	1
	don't get all your ideas of what a hyundai truly is based on the elantra                                i didn't mean that as a bad thing.... i figure if they can build a cheaper car as well as the current elantra than their larger offerings must be equal or even better.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4579#msg4579re: ride problem does exist [tjc78]        i see your line of thinking.	1
	the 3.8 premium package is a great deal and you still get a car very well equipped.	1
	you can always upgrade the headlights with an aftermarket hid kit (they just won't be self leveling) for not a lot of money.	1
	ahhhhhhhhhhhh...gotcha!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4580#msg4580re: ride problem does exist [bobad]        sadly... i think not.	1
	just to give you some reference points, bmw analyzes its own used parts for wear characteristics.	1
	in fact, it has the highest recycling rate of any part supplier in the world.	1
	check out this company fact sheet on its parts management practice.	1
	http://www.bmwgroup.com/bmwgroup_prod/publikationen/e/2005/pdf/alex_current_fact- book_recycling_of_end_of_life_vehicles.pdf                                add to that millions of euros they spend on car racing.	1
	racing is not for fun or advertising value (ok may be little bit of adverting value and womanizing for the execs...).	1
	but it's really for development of cars.	1
	do you know why honda accords handle so darn well?	1
	honda was in the thick of f1 development in the '80 and early '90s.	1
	before aryton senna died in a tragic f1 accident, honda/mclearen team ruled the f1 universe - even ferrari had a tough time beating them.	1
	(btw.	1
	mclearen is the manufacturer of the mb super car slr) honda was the first to roll out double wish bone suspension designs to cars that cost less than $20k and made civics import tuners favorite cars to tinker with - it's not because the cars were easy to work with but it was because the basic set up was that good.	1
	all in all, nothing beats racing in terms of product development.	1
	and let me not go into mb and bmw history on racing.	1
	you know they've got pedigree.	1
	(btw.	1
	nascar doesn't count as racing - flame me if you will                )                                next factor is model history.	1
	mb and bmw has years of consumer history and technical repair data from essentially a similar car for a long long time.	1
	think about the history of the 3 series compared to genesis!	1
	some people say that hyundai developed this car using 6 years of development time and hired real race car drivers to drive around hyundai probing ground in so cal and stuff.	1
	all true.	1
	in fact it's a commendable effort and money they put into the whole effort.	1
	in fact, genesis costs about double what it costs in the us when you purchase it in korea.	1
	genesis is still a good car.	1
	i have to believe that they will do a mid-model year change to revise the suspension just a bit.	1
	i personally think that the suspension setting is not that stiff.	1
	it's the loss of control when the roads get rough that bothers me.	1
	the harmonics upset the chassis and it doesn't smooth out until after 4 to 5 bumps on the shocks.	1
	again this occurs only when there is a perfect combo of smooth and rough road combined.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4581#msg4581hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension        let me set the record straight.	1
	i have owned the genesis now for 4 weeks, and i regret it immensely.	1
	the suspension stinks.	1
	the car, for all its bells and whistles, as gorgeous on the outside, and impressive on the inside, lacks the smooth drive one would expect in a luxury car.	1
	the drive is clumsy, bouncy and downright sickening.	1
	i cannot recommend this car.	1
	trust me.	1
	i did not notice the hard drive during the test drive as i was on smooth streets, nor did the people in the car with me.	1
	i have complained to the dealer who sold me the car and to hyundais consumer affairs.	1
	they say the car has a sporty suspension.	1
	for me, it is a lame excuse for 'boy did hyundai screw up'.	1
	don't get hooked on the looks of the car...it drives worse than a truck.	1
	i even took the car to a tire expert, thinking smaller tires with more sidewall would help.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4586#msg4586re: hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension [blw1]         i even took the car to a tire expert, thinking smaller tires with more sidewall would help.	1

	everyone knows the car wash guy is the real suspension engineer.	1
	kidding aside, i think your hyundai dealer is right.	1
	coming from an american car with fat tires to a sport tuned suspension with 18' wheels and low profile tires can take some getting used to.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4587#msg4587what i don't understand        folks talk about how they took the genesis for a test drive and didn't notice certain things during the test drive, but after a couple/few weeks of ownership...they post about all these problems they seem to have.	1
	why in the world would you only test drive the car on smooth roads?	1
	the first thing i ask the sales person when i test drive a car is, 'where can we find some rough roads?'	1
	if a sales person has a problem with you taking an extensive test drive, walk away.	1
	seriously, a lot could be avoided if people really took the time to really test drive the genesis, i guarantee there would be less complaining.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4589#msg4589re: what i don't understand [kenb757]        you may be right.	1
	all it takes is a test drive that takes you further than down the street and back or around the same block a couple times.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4590#msg4590re: what i don't understand [allmet33]        i test drove three azeras over various surfaces with some very rough for about 30-45 minutes each time.	1
	did not notice the severe wallowing/bouncing that would develop around 1,000+ miles.	1
	on 3rd set of shocks at 14,500 miles and wallowing continues on all except perfectly smooth roads.	1
	test drove 3 genesis' and noticed all three had less than luxury car rides which was similar to what has been described by automobile mag, car and driver and consumer reports among others.	1
	personaly, based on my azera experience, i wonder if the genesis ride gets worse as it ages.	1
	of course, issue could be inconsistent quality control at assembly and by suppliers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4591#msg4591re: what i don't understand [kenb757]        the thing is if you line in a 'big city' you may not get the varying degrees of roads on the usual test drive allowed.	1
	i don't own a hyundai of any kind.	1
	however, there has to be 'something' to this ride thing.	1
	so i would suggest asking for a demo and taking it for a few hours, or the entire day.	1
	offer of course to pay for any fuel used.	1
	if this is not permissible, i simply wouldn't consider this car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4592#msg4592re: what i don't understand [carolinabob]        i truly wish i could experience the wallowing that i've heard so much about...just so i can know what you are talking about.	1
	i've had my '06 azera now for 3+ years and it has just over 67k miles on it.	1
	the only strut that's been replaced is the front passenger side and the ride is just as good as it has always been for me.	1
	no wallowing, no clunking...nothing.	1
	when i purchased, i took the car for a 2.5 hour test drive.	1
	i picked the family up, drove it along the route i drive on my daily commute, parked it in my driveway and finally went back to the dealership with a smile on my face.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4593#msg4593re: what i don't understand [allmet33]        my experiences are very similar to yours.	1
	i don't own a hyundai but i have test driven the azera and the genesis.	1
	both, to me, had a very nicely controlled ride and i did not experience any problems.	1
	i kept the genesis for about half a day as the dealer was very accommodating.	1
	both cars were top notch.	1
	on a par with bmw, if not a little better in the ride dept.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4594#msg4594re: what i don't understand [carolinabob]        think you'll find that 'ride' evaluations tend to be quite subjective.	1
	you'll find folks out there that think a grand marquis, for example, has a wonderful ride when others will tell you that it is about the 'sloppiest' car ever made.	1
	i happen to drive an avalon touring model with a 'tightened up' suspension which is what i prefer.	1
	some avalon drivers will find it too 'harsh' while i think the standard avalon suspension is much too soft and 'sloppy'.	1
	camry drivers will think a mazda6 has a ride like a skletboard, and likewise the 6 driver will tell you that the camry drives like an old folks car.	1
	to a large degree - different strokes for different folks.	1
	hyundai may indeed have put a 'too soft' suspension in the genesis considering that they are apparently trying to attract buyers that otherwise might appreciate how a german sedan drives.	1
	i'm not sure though that it is realisitic to expect the car to meet those soft 'luxurious' ride expectations and still not be sloppy under some conditons.	1
	those two charcterisitics do tend to go together unless, of course, that emblem does say bmw, mb, lexus and/or infiniti        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4595#msg4595automobile mag update on genesis--no complaints        if you are taking with a grain of salt the complaints about the genesis, you can follow on the long term test blogs here on edmunds or on the automobile magazine website.	1
	the automobile mag long term test blog has been cited by the detractors as being proof of the harsh and unstable ride.	1
	well, they updated their blog for april, noting they put on another 3,000 miles.	1
	it is now their 'vehicle of choice for long trips'.	1
	a reviewer who put on 1,000 miles in the car noted it held its own in wet and rainy conditions.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4596#msg4596hey, blw1        you sound very upset about your genesis.	1
	just lose your job and return the car under the 'assurance' program.                                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4597#msg4597suspension        i'm keeping my eye on the genesis.	1
	i own a 2006 azera.	1
	i guess i'm not as sensitive to suspension issues.	1
	although i hate driving over bumps -- which does jar the vehicle -- it really hasn't been much of a problem.	1
	other than that, the azera has been very good and from what i've read, the genesis is a significant upgrade from the azera.	1
	of course, i haven't owned bmws or mercedes, or acuras or infinities, so i don't have much to compare with.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4598#msg4598'assurance' programs        haven't tried it but it would seem logical that any car would be cheaper to buy if excluded from programs like this.	1
	if i'm going to pay cash for a new genesis or am retired, then aren't i entitled to some share of whatever it costs hyundai to finance the program?	1
	no such thing as a free lunch.	1
	while i'm confident that there is a whole bunch of fine print, this is a bit of marketing genius.	1
	several other mfgrs have jumped on board with 'assurance' programs  and are even sweetening the 'deal' by promising to cover some car payments, wouldn't all of that effect the negotiated price of the car in the first place ?	1
	it should.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4599#msg4599re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        you know...it shouldn't affect the negotiated price because it's a program that they have put together and offered with the vehicle, not as an option.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4600#msg4600re: 'assurance' programs [allmet33]        but just because the cost of such a program isn't shown on the window sticker doesn't mean that the program doesn't have a price (or a cost) .	1
	hyundai (and others)  are assuming a risk and will be taking back some used cars  likely losing some money in the process.	1
	furthermore, it would seem to me that when i tell them that i drive 50k miles/yr that the price of my 'assured' genesis would go up simply because the value of what's potentially returned to them is that much less.	1
	if and when i want to go out and buy a genesis or any car offered by a mfgr.	1
	with such a program.	1
	and i am paying cash, you better believe i'm asking for a better price simply because i have no need for their 'program'.	1
	only makes sense - whether i can get the better price or not,  who knows -  but as i said -  i should.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4601#msg4601re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        maybe you can, good luck trying though.	1
	like i said, it's not an option offered with the car, there's no value placed on the program being offered...so how can you negotiate a knock-off on the price?	1
	don't get me wrong, i'm not saying it isn't worth a try...good luck.	1
	furthermore, it would seem to me that when i tell them that i drive 50k miles/yr that the price of my 'assured' genesis would go up simply because the value of what's potentially returned to them is that much less.	1
	first of all...why would you tell them you drive 50k miles a year to begin with?	1
	according to the details, if you drove 50k miles within that 1st year of ownership, the trade value of that car would be much lower than with normal mileage and the assurance program allows you up to $7500 of negative equity.	1
	this'll explain how the whole things works...                                 hyundai assurance program details        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4602#msg4602re: 'assurance' programs [allmet33]         first of all...why would you tell them you drive 50k miles a year to begin with?	1
	if i'm hyundai and i'm a good businessman i would have to ask and likely get the buyer to sign a piece of paper that would try to prevent me from putting that many miles on it.	1
	besides which what good  does it it do me to lie about it?	1
	in effect, not a whole lot different than leasing a car, the buyer is guaranteeing the condition (and value) of what he/she is returning.	1
	the $7500 limit may not be enough for something more expensive like a genesis, wonder what the number is if i want an accent?	1
	or who it is exactly that decides that the dimiished value of my  returned high mileage car exceeds that allowance and therefore they need to dung me for the balance?	1
	or if  hyundai's residual values take even more of a hit simply because there are a whole bunch of 'assured' genesis being returned and therefore  more folks exceed that limit?	1
	i could easily imagine a situation that some poor guy returns his genesis  and then finds out that hyundai would be happy to take it back - once he writes them a check for the difference (say a grand or two)  this guy just lost his job and probably shouldn't be writing any checks at all!	1
	many car buyers are 'upside down' on their car loans as soon as they drive it out of the showroom.	1
	seems that there should also be a % downpayment requirement.	1
	nobody ever accused the koreans of being bad businessmen, you surely don't believe that when i return my 50k genesis that hyundai is going to take it back without being reimbursed for all that extra wear i put on the car?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4603#msg4603re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        in all the years of purchasing cars, the only folks that ever seem interested in the numbers of miles you drive every year are the insurance folks (and sales folks when you're leasing).	1
	i've never had a salesperson ask how many miles i'm driving.	1
	so, yes, i can see how it could affect you on a lease.	1
	on the flip side, if you know your'e going to be putting 50k miles on a car in a year, then just how intelligent of a move is it to lease the car to begin with?	1
	nobody ever accused the koreans of being bad businessmen, you surely don't believe that when i return my 50k genesis that hyundai is going to take it back without being reimbursed for all that extra wear i put on the car?	1
	which is why they say the cover up to $7500 in negative equity...anything after that, the owner is coming out of their pocket to make up the difference.	1
	makes sense.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4604#msg4604test drove one this weekend        so after reading all these posts with regards to the suspension, i had to see for myself.	1
	i test drove a v8 genesis for about 30 minutes and for my preference, it is not the type of ride for me.	1
	i didn't like the way the suspension was a mix of luxury and sporty.	1
	we have a 2002 nissan maxima that we are looking to upgrade and it was not better than the maxima in terms of suspension for us.	1
	my wife also agreed that she did not like it.	1
	as noted by others before, i think that everyone should drive it and make their own opinions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4605#msg4605re: 'assurance' programs [allmet33]         anything after that, the owner is coming out of their pocket to make up the difference.	1
	makes sense                exactly what i'm saying - there are thousands and thousands of lease cars every year that sit in the garage and are not driven simply because of the .20/mile or so  extra it would eventually cost to drive them as needed.	1
	this shouldn't be a whole lot different in several respects then me turning the car back into hyundai after an assurance purchase, because of the $7500.00 coverage limit  i'm still guaranteeing the car's value just like i would had i leased it.	1
	i guess what i'm getting around to here, is a suspicion that these 'assurance' programs are really nothing more than a clever marketing gimmick and possibly of little real world value.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4606#msg4606re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        clever marketing?	1
	apparently.	1
	hyundai's sales have been excellent (for these times) since the program was introduced.	1
	i don't think that's a coincidence.	1
	little real world value?	1
	if you happened to buy a hyundai and then either lost your job, became physically disabled, lost your driver's license due to medical impairment (note those last two would apply even for someone who is retired), got an international employment transfer (happens a lot in the company i work for), had a self-employed personal bankruptcy, or died accidentally (and your heirs didn't want/need the car), the assurance program could have quite a bit of real-world value.	1
	if this is a major concern for you in your consideration of purchasing a genesis, you could always ask hyundai customer service or your local hyundai dealer if there is a way to 'opt out' of the assurance program for some kind of discount off the car, i.e.	1
	for the value of the insurance premium hyundai would pay.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4608#msg4608hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension        well, after much talk with corporate and regional, hyundai will do nothing to assist.	1
	they are very kind and courteous, showing intent to help you.	1
	but, in the end, unless i am willing to trade down, i am stuck with the car.	1
	they say the car was designed this way, not a material defect, but i cannot help but think that the bounciness was not part of their plan, but they will never admit it...i now have a mechanic checking to see if either bluespan or bogey double oscillating shocks (which will reduce the bounciness) will work with the genesis..  anyone out there investigate this already?	1
	it's either that or sell the car back to hyundai at a loss.they won't refund  my money..surprise.	1
	thanks.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4609#msg4609re: hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension [blw1]        you could try the lemon law in your state.	1
	try google for attorneys doing it.	1
	re: assurance plan.	1
	this has no benefit for me.	1
	hyundai should be able to offer it as an optional plan, just as they do a monetary discount or a lower percentage loan.	1
	even if hyundai buys back the car if you lose your job, etc.	1
	; you will still need a car for transportation.	1
	so how many people will really be able to take advantage of it?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4610#msg4610re: hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension [carolinabob]         even if hyundai buys back the car if you lose your job, etc.	1
	; you will still need a car for transportation.	1
	so how many people will really be able to take advantage of it?	1
	then it would seem that folks in that predicament would need to head down to their local auction and purchase a car outright and not worry about it.	1
	the point is...it's a reality that folks are losing their jobs without knowing it's going to happen.	1
	someone could have just gotten a decent raise and wanted to reward themselves with a nicer car.	1
	say they go and by a genesis and 3 months after ownership, he gets laid off due to cut-backs.	1
	well...the advantage here is that you can take the car back and it won't be something that will affect your credit so that when you do get another job, it won't be as hard to get another car.	1
	if it has no benefit to you, then why worry about it?	1
	why does it need to be an optional plan?	1
	it's only good for the 1st year of ownership, so if you get into year 2 and you lose your job...you're stuck.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4611#msg4611re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        yes captain, we know...everything is a gimmick in your eyes.	1
	as far as the plan, seriously...it sounds like you were looking for a free ride and disappointed you didn't get it.	1
	as far as leased cars sitting in garages because of mileage issues, then it would seem that thousands of people made a bad decision in taking on a lease thinking it would save them some money.	1
	if you know you're gonna put high mileage on a car, you can pay for it on the front end of a lease or simply just buy the car.	1
	personally, i think the auto industry needs to change the mileage standards since most brag their cars can do 100k miles with little to no problems...why are we still stuck in the stone age of believing the average annual mileage should be between 10-15k miles.	1
	oh yeah, it's their way of making money.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4612#msg4612re: hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension [blw1]        there are shock sizes and profiles for every possible application.	1
	a shock with a little slower return may help, although it can make the overall ride a bit firmer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4613#msg4613re: hyundai genesis - bouncy suspension [bobad]        if the genesis ends up being like the azera in terms of procurring non-hyundai suspension parts, don't hold your breath.	1
	the azera, 3 model years in, has no known aftermarket, replacement shocks/struts available.	1
	the only thing you can find are lowering springs and full coil-over set-ups.	1
	with people crying afoul in regards to the suspensions in both the genesis  the azera, there has to be some company (monroe, kyb, bilstein...) that would be interested in producing aftermarket replacements to give owners options.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4614#msg4614re: 'assurance' programs [backy]        yeah clever marketing does have a tendency to help sales - that bother you?	1
	little real world value because of the limitations ($7500) put on the program as i explained.	1
	must bother you even more, i guess.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4615#msg4615re: 'assurance' programs [captain2]        doesn't bother me at all... it was not moi who brought it up.	1
	nor did i bring up that the assurance program has 'little real world value.'	1
	i think it does.	1
	it is after all like an insurance program--you only benefit from it if you fall into certain circumstances--but i think most people would say insurance has value.	1
	i know i pay a lot each month for insurance on my life, my family's lives, my house, my cars.	1
	i have had to use that insurance a few times... hopefully not the life kind, anytime soon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4616#msg4616re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [backy]        i have been dealing with these issues since i bought the car about a month ago.	1
	hyundai here won't do a thing as they say it is not a 'material defect'.	1
	i have now asked a very experienced mechanic to investigate the possilbilty of putting in double oscillating shock absorbers (boge or bluespan, for instance) to help with the bounciness.	1
	if this proves to be futile, i am looking at selling the car back to hyundai or living with  this...corporate and regional have admitted similar complaints, but no promises of a fixing it or putting in new parts later..though i sense the seed has been planted.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4617#msg4617re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [blw1]        just wondering, you say the problem has been in existence since you purchased the car...it just showed up the moment after you signed the paperwork???	1
	what type of test drive did you take prior to purchasing?	1
	i only ask because it seems you wouldn't even be in this position had you taken a serious test drive.	1
	i seriously don't get it.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4618#msg4618re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [blw1]        yeah, i don't get it either.	1
	when i bought a new tv for my bedroom, i spent weeks researching before i decided on the model and made a purchase - and that was just a few hundred dollars.	1
	you would think when planning a $35,000 + new car purchase, one would read every review, visit 9 dealers, slam the doors 250 times, manipulate the controls until your fingers are bleeding, and test drive - test drive - test drive.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4621#msg4621re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        i live 30 miles from where i bought my car.	1
	i test drove to genesis at two different dealers...freeways, around the block, up and down the streets..unfortunately, these strees and highways were relatively smooth, and while i noticed a stiffer ride than what  i am used to, there was no bounce...the bounciness occurs on freeways where there are grooves..and where i live, those freeways are abundant.	1
	so, the hard ride on residential streets is not what i am complaining about..it is the rock and roll feeling my car generates when driving down these freeways..my passengers tell me the ride in the back seat is like sitting it a jeep or truck..anyway, the bottom line, i have driven many cars in my life, and i have never experienced this bonciness, except on a  bus...i think for such a great car, and i love everything else about this car, and for the money i spent, i did not expect the bounce.	1
	it is a sickening feeling and i am wondering why hyndai thinks this is what was planned.	1
	i really do not believe that.	1
	i think they blew it..to those still test driving it..take a ride in the back seat...you will really see what i mean...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4622#msg4622excerpt from autobytel...        the genesis is equipped with amplitude selective dampers, which are basically two shocks in one.	1
	these multi-vein shocks have one mode for small, high-frequency bumps and ripples and another mode for the larger motions shocks usually deal with.	1
	hyundai says they improve ride comfort, optimize road surface contact, and increase body and wheel control.	1
	on the road, they help the genesis provide a smooth, quiet ride.	1
	we detected no float or wallow, though we did find that the ride got too bouncy over humps and ruts at highway speeds.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4623#msg4623re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [blw1]        i test drove a genesis on both rough, uneven roads and on the highway.	1
	i noticed no difference in ride nor felt any bounce in suspension.	1
	i live in savannah, ga and the roads here are all jacked up if you know what i mean.	1
	i guess i'm just used to the road conditions here and no matter what kind of car i drive(sonata, azera, avalon, mkz, aura) they all feel the same to me on these roads.	1
	i think that someone trading in a european vehicle for the genesis is expecting the same ride, sorry not gonna happen.	1
	european cars ride differently than any other cars on the road today.	1
	does anyone here agree with this?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4624#msg4624re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        do you test drive the car you buy?	1
	i never have.	1
	usually the car i buy is buried in the back lots needing preparation with 1 mile on the odometer.	1
	i won't sign the final papers unless i visually examine the car in daylight.	1
	but most of us drive similiar models, not the car we buy.	1
	one exception, my last toyota i drove from the lot with .1 mile on it to the dealer's place of prep.	1
	could be the car is a lemon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4625#msg4625pulling trigger....        well, i have decided to get a genesis.	1
	i just can't find anything on the road that gives what the genesis gives for the money.	1
	my deal is basically done, deposit down just waiting for the dealer to confirm the dealer trade today.	1
	i ended up on the v6 premium package only as i don't like the 18' wheels and don't require nav.	1
	cabernet red pearl / cashmere                                as for the ride....  i find it to be tighter than my '06 avalon xls but more than acceptable.	1
	the model i drove had the 18' and did have a                 slight                bounce over hard imperfections and manhole covers.	1
	i never felt any jarring motions or anything that made the car feel out of control.	1
	the 17s should only yield a slightly softer ride and who knows what the tires were inflated at on the one i test drove.	1
	ride is really a subjective quality and for me was quite nice.	1
	also worth noting that this is one quiet machine.	1
	i thought my avalon was quiet until i drove this.	1
	one thing i will say is i do feel the 2gr v6 in the avalon is a bit more refined than the 3.8 in the gen.  the 2gr feels like it is much more free to rev and just sounds a bit better doing it.	1
	however, the 3.8 did pull nice once over 4k rpm.	1
	i'll have to see how it breaks in to make a totally fair comparison.	1
	so, wish me luck the dealer trade goes well and i'll be posting my impressions after i take delivery.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4626#msg4626re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        i test drove at least 3 azeras for up to 45 minutes before purchasing one.	1
	the suspension ride/issues did not show up until about the 1,000 mile mark.	1
	same each time hyundai replaced the shocks.	1
	test drove 3 genesis' and noted what consumer reports calls a 'nervous ride' and others call other things.	1
	unfortunately at the time, sales people were under the gun to not let you drive more than a few miles, so i didn't since i was not close to buying at the time.	1
	also, most car dealers require that a salesperson go with you on test drives and they constantly chatter, which distracts from your concentrating on everything about the car.	1
	ironically, the lexus dealer never sends anyone on test drives, even in $90,000 cars.	1
	bottom line:  not all issues are going to show up on a test drive, no matter how long.	1
	that's what makes sites like this so valuable because people with miles of experience can comment and let the rest of us know.	1
	btw, re: assurance plan.	1
	my contention is that it should be offered as an option as other incentives are since many people will not want it.	1
	it does cost hyundai,  which they pass on to all purchasers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4627#msg4627re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kdshapiro]         do you test drive the car you buy?	1
	to answer your question...yes, i do!	1
	the new cars i have purchased, usually get pulled up with less than 10 miles on the odometer (which tells me folks merely took a spin around the block in it).	1
	by the time i get back, it'll have about 35 miles on it...that's right, i put about 25 miles on the odometer and since i knew they were miles i put on it...i didn't have a problem buying it.	1
	also, since i just spent that time with the car and everything was up to my expectations, why grab another car where something could be wrong with it?	1
	i'm very specific in terms of what i want on the car and they usually bring one to me optioned out as i requested in the color i want, that way...all they have to do it prep it while i go in an sign the paperwork.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4628#msg4628re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [carolinabob]         unfortunately at the time, sales people were under the gun to not let you drive more than a few miles, so i didn't since i was not close to buying at the time.	1
	also, most car dealers require that a salesperson go with you on test drives and they constantly chatter, which distracts from your concentrating on everything about the car.	1
	must be the area you're in, here in the dc meto area...they didn't have a problem with handing me the key and telling me, 'go pick up the family and enjoy the ride.'	1
	this was in january of '06, the car was still trickling into the dealerships at the time, and they didn't have a problem with me taking the car for an extended test drive.	1
	maybe they knew how serious i was about buying, who knows.	1
	personally, if a dealer won't let me spend significant time behind the wheel as i see fit, then i won't buy a car from them.	1
	in this economy, with folks getting laid off left and right, i can assure you that there will be plenty of folks appreciating the peace of mind the assurance plan offers.	1
	if it's offered as an option, then it's given monetary value (hyundai isn't stupid) and then they know they would have to offer discounts for those that opt to not have the assurance plan included in their purchase.	1
	as it is now, it's thrown in at no extra charge just like the standard 10yr/100k mile warranty.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4629#msg4629re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]         as it is now, it's thrown in at no extra charge just like the standard 10yr/100k mile warranty.	1
	the dealer never even mentioned the 'assurance' to me last night.	1
	maybe it doesn't apply to leases?	1
	it didn't sway me one way or another.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4630#msg4630re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [tjc78]        actually...it does apply to leases.	1
	hyundai assurance plan details                                sounds like a terrible salesperson to me, how much did he cover the 10yr/100k mile warranty?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4631#msg4631re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        actually there was no 'selling' involved.	1
	probably the easiest deal he ever made.	1
	i knew i wanted the genesis and drove it twice prior.	1
	made an appt for 7:30 last night and it went like this:                                greeted at door and spoke for a few mins                they located me exactly what i wanted                came out with a nice offer                i made a lower offer and we met in the middle                i filled out a credit app and handed them my credit card for a deposit.	1
	cap cost on the lease was 1300 under invoice with the 1000 rebate, mf and residual were the same as hyundai's current offer.	1
	i was out in a little over an hour, and if all goes weli it will be 'burning gas' tommorrow.	1
	i'll post more details in the leasing forum once all is signed.	1
	as for the 10/100k warranty, again what would he be selling i will put less than 36,000 miles before it goes back.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4632#msg4632re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [tjc78]        considering you pretty much knew what you wanted, the salesperson most likely assumed you did your homework...so what would have been the point of discussing the assurance plan?	1
	honestly, with the info that's available via the internet these days, i wouldn't be surprised if the saleperson actually phases out.	1
	they'll just need someone there to help you with a test drive and escort you to the finance department.	1
	the last 3 cars i purchased, i knew more about the vehilcles than the salesperson did.	1
	congrats on your lease, hope you enjoy it more than some.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4633#msg4633re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        thanks, i did know what i wanted as i didn't want to waste anyone's time including my own.	1
	i sent an email earlier in the day asking for a quote and went from there.	1
	the other dealer i test drove at was not willing to meet my price and wasn't very interested in doing a trade.	1
	i guess that is why on tuesday night i was the only one in that dealer and last night i witnessed at least 4 people working deals.	1
	as for enjoying the car i see no reason why not, the ride was acceptable to me the comfort is superb and the amenities are great.	1
	when i first drove it i thought it was smaller up front than my avalon, however after getting more seat time and adjusting the seat i find the genesis actually being a touch roomier in the front, with the avalon having the slight edge in the rear.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4634#msg4634re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [tjc78]        makes sense, i don't think anybody likes spending any significant time at a dealership.	1
	when i purchased my azera, walked in, they gave me an offer with was actually lower than i expected, filled out the paperwork for financing, they called me when they located the exact car i wanted and had it delivered, went and checked it out, drove it and then took delivery.	1
	i think the room thing is subjective to who is driving and where the seat position is.	1
	i know i sat in the genesis and put the seat in a very comofortable driving position and i thought it didn't leave much room behind me at all.	1
	my daughter climbed in and the seat back was a good 6-7' away from her knees.	1
	in my azera, my seat back may only be about 2' away from her knees.	1
	it is truly a roomy car with a laundry list of amenities.	1
	i certainly hope you'll be doing a write up along the way to share your experience with the car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4635#msg4635re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        you are one of the very few.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4636#msg4636re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kdshapiro]        well...if you're the one putting the miles on it...what's the difference?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4637#msg4637re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kdshapiro]         i usually don't take cars with any miles on them                                so what are you to do when the dealer you want to buy from doesn't have the model you are looking for?	1
	my last car and now my genesis had to dealer exchanged.	1
	sometimes you have to accept some mileage to get what you want.	1
	it really doesn't concern me.	1
	as long as you inspect the car before purchase all will be fine.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4639#msg4639re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [californiadan]        couldn't agree with you more.. it is amazing how hyundai consumer affairs and the regional office (california) say it's normal and meant to emulate the bmw 5 serires..who are they kidding..i am currently having my mechanic check to see if there are amy kind of shocks out there that i can put on that will be comptabile with the car and reduce the boune..will let you know.       	1

	i mean...in terms of size, the g's don't hold a candle to the genesis.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4644#msg4644re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [tjc78]         so what are you to do when the dealer you want to buy from doesn't have the model you are looking for?	1
	i don't buy a car at that time.	1
	sometimes you have to accept some mileage to get what you want.	1
	different strokes for different folks.	1
	you never know how the first few miles were accrued.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4645#msg4645re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kdshapiro]         you never know how the first few miles were accrued.	1
	less than 50, i really don't see how it matters...anything over, yeah...i would have a problem with saying i'm buying a new car at that point.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4646#msg4646re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kdshapiro]         you never know how the first few miles were accrued                                i hear ya!	1
	i guess that because i lease and will never put more than 36k on my car i am a little less worried about that.	1
	honestly you would have to really beat the living heck out of it to cause major damage down the road.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4647#msg4647genesis is really good for a 1st time effort!!	1
	hi,i test drove the genesis yesterday after all the reviews and ratings.	1
	and i own a lexus ,so i could compare it to my lexus.	1
	i must say--genesis is really good.for a 1st time effort,it is superb.and consider it has to compete with lexus or bmw.no mean achievement.for about 20k less.that is amazing.	1
	the exterior styling ,a little bland,,but definitely looks a luxury sedan.the interior was a revelation.really good fit ,finish and materials..very good quality and execution .	1
	the ride--- again very good.not nearly as smooth or plush like lexus but very good.and pretty good over rough roads too.again,not  nearly lexus but good.but lexus costs 20k more.	1
	again  when lexus came in 1990,it was not this good on it`s 1st attempt.so all credit to hyundai.they have  really made an outstanding car.much better than acura or infiniti sedans considering they have been around for years..                                folks have to understand that it is a first attempt by hyundai and they have got it 90 %correct.that is no mean feat,,deserves lot of credit for intent,effort and performance with decent pricing.great bang for the buck.plus it`s long warranty is a big bonus..really good deal.being a lexus owner,i am amazed at the 1st luxury hyundai sedan.surely deserves all the kudos.	1
	the only drawback is-- it`s resale value.hyundai`s resale values are in the tank.they depreciate really really horribly..and if the trend continues,,well ,the genesis will be a truly great used car bargain.	1
	so yes,,i am waiting 2 years down the line to buy a 2yr used genesis!!	1
	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4648#msg4648re: genesis is really good for a 1st time effort!!	1
	[deltheking]        you made some very valid points, however i think the resale value is going to be noticebly higher.	1
	this may surprise a lot of people looking for a great used car bargain.	1
	why?	1
	for the first time hyundai is attracting customers that would have never in the past considered the hyundai brand.	1
	in this recession people are looking to save money but not cut quality.	1
	according to hyundai they allocated only 8,000 in the us for the 09 model year.	1
	in the world of supply and demand if the supply increases the price will decrease if the demand increase (which i think it will) then the price increases.	1
	if genesis lives up to its inital quality with long term durability then in 34 months when my lease is up the payout of $19,000 for a v6 tech will be a bargain that i will have no problem paying off.	1
	my gut feeling is that a 3 year old genesis will be worth low to mid 20's.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4649#msg4649re: genesis is really good for a 1st time effort!!	1
	[toye]        i think a top-end genesis might be worth low-to-mid $20s in 3 years, but i think there will be some 2009 base genesis v6 sedans available for around $16k give or take in 3 years.	1
	that would not be out of the ballpark for depreciation on luxury cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4650#msg4650re: genesis is really good for a 1st time effort!!	1
	[backy]        from what i'm seeing is that at least 2/3 of the genesis being sold or leased are the with the tech package.	1
	maybe $18-19k for base model in 3 years.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4651#msg4651re: genesis is really good for a 1st time effort!!	1
	[toye]        resale on the azera, last 'luxury' car from hyundai would tend to discount the genesis having a high resale value.	1
	it might, but it will still be a hyundai.	1
	i and many others were attracted to the hyundai brand for the first time by all the favorable publicity for the azera.	1
	btw, based on cars.com, auto trader and visits to dealer websites, the genesis does not appear to be selling that well in the southeastern us.	1
	after the initial burst of 'gotta have it' syndrome is satisfied, what will the sales be?       	1

	take an objective friend to compare the two over the same course.	1
	that would be the easiest way to find if your car drives differently to other genesises.	1
	another possible cause may be over inflated tire.	1
	too much air will cause a very bumpy ride.	1
	i also read a motor trend article that the biggest complaint in korea last year about the genesis  was that it 'floated' and they had their engineers recalibrated the suspension for the american market.       	1

	hmmmmmmmmmmmm...dunno kenb757...i currently own an '04 audi a6 quattro and the ride is hardly harsh.	1
	it isn't what i would call a luxurious, soft ride, but...it's very comfortable, compliant and confident over any road surface you throw at it.	1
	as far as the ride goes, everyone seems to want to use bmw as the standard by which to compare the genesis.	1
	anyone that owns a bmw will tell you, it is not a luxurious ride at all, it's a very sport tuned ride that happens to be best of it's type.	1
	folks hammered the azera (consumers and the media alike) for having a suspension that was too soft, so hyundai went the other direction and now it's too hard (for some).	1
	considering it's hyundai's first foray into the full luxury segment, they are still doing a good job with a few kinks to work out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4660#msg4660re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [blw1]        good luck with that, but don't be surprised if you lose the case.	1

	the azera competes with the entry-level lexus fwd mushmobiles and the genesis addresses the european rwd luxury sedans.	1
	to grab market share from lexus rwd mushmobiles, hyundai should offer the korean genesis suspension as an option.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4663#msg4663re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        allmet33,                you had asked for a description of the ride in my 07 azera, so i will provide here.	1
	apologize to anyone else who may be offended.	1
	at 14,791 miles and on 3rd set of front shocks, the car continues to bounce over road imperfections such as rises or dips.	1
	these are 'normal' ones that almost all roads have, not big ones.	1
	also does it at ends when crossing bridges.	1
	the car will bounce rapidly to the limit of the shock and then bounce in the other direction to the limit of the shock.	1
	it will do it twice and sometimes three times before returning to normal.	1
	there is very little damping.	1
	the car also bounces severely from side to side when the rise/dip is only on one side of the lane.	1
	it is bothersome over just one dip/rise, but when there are several, it is very disconcerting.	1
	regional service manager is going to set up an appointment to address it next time he is here, along with the continuing odor in the trunk.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4664#msg4664re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        i drove a few audis when i was looking to replace my 06 q45.	1
	the only audi i drove with an acceptable ride is the a8 (which has a very nice ride when in the comfort setting).	1
	drove an a6, but it had a truck-like ride.	1
	my q45 was harsh too.	1
	seems the dts, ls460, and s550 have the most comfortable rides.	1
	the town car rides nicely too, but it's a boat and ford doesn't seem to want to update it.	1
	the new  mks rides more like a ford than a lincoln, suffers from torque steer, and the steering wheel vibrates like a focus at idle.	1
	might as well buy yourself a taurus and save $10k or more as lincoln no longer exists in my book.	1
	on the other hand, the genesis will be a very nice car with the korean-tuned suspension.       	1

	did you mean that a 2000 camry xle is a better riding car than a new genesis?	1
	i traded an '03 xle v-6 in on an 07 azera because i wanted to move up to a larger, more luxurious car.	1
	all the reviews at that time were saying that was what the azera was-a luxury car to threaten lexus, et.	1
	al.	1
	unfortunately, the azera does not ride as well as the camry did and it is because of poor design or components.	1
	you are not supposed to give up comfortable ride in a luxury car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4667#msg4667re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kenb757]        kenb757...maybe you just need a car with a very long wheelbase to make you happy.	1
	every car you mentioned as having the most comfortable rides are the biggest cars of each make.	1
	i would expect the ride in the a8 to be better than that of the a6, but truck-like...hardly my friend.	1
	i don't know what trucks you've driven, but the a6 i currently own rides nothing like a truck.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4668#msg4668re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [carolinabob]         you are not supposed to give up comfortable ride in a luxury car                                you have obviously never ridden in a m35/45 sport.	1
	i have an '06 avalon xls (for a few more days anyway, coming off lease) and can tell you it definately rides much softer than the genesis.	1
	does it ride 'better', well thats subjective.	1
	i wanted a firmer ride this time around and went with the genesis (pick up tonight).	1
	i just can't say anything bad about the ride other than it is firm and its meant to be.	1
	there is no doubt the genesis is a decent handler for its size and you just can't have crisp handling and a pillow soft ride.	1
	a bmw 5 series rides pretty similar to the genesis, however, the bmw does have a better ride/handling compromise which comes at a price of course.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4669#msg4669re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [carolinabob]        no, i was referring to the syrupy, numb ride that the camry is known for.	1
	someone who is accustomed to this kind of ride will find the genesis' sport-tuned ride intolerable.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4670#msg4670re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        you're right, i exaggerated, but only a bit.	1
	i didn't drive it more than a mile as i immediately knew it wasn't going to meet my requirements in the area of comfort.	1
	but, it's all a matter of experiences and points of reference.	1
	just as i don't expect anyone who watches fox news to have a 'fair and balanced' view of world events, i don't expect anyone coming out of a dts or ls460 to think an a6 rides smoothly.	1
	just as 99% of the people alive today cannot remember the great service and seven course meals in first class in the 60s, they blindly accept the crappy airline service that has become de rigueur since deregulation in 1978       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4671#msg4671re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [kenb757]        now that is much more fair!	1
	anyone used to riding on the longer wheelbases of ls, s-class, q's and such...will find it very hard to compare the ride of anything smaller and say it's as good or offers the same level of comfort.	1
	look at the wheebases of the maybach, bentley and rolls...the longer the wheelbase, the more supple the ride can be (unless you're talking tractor trailer, rv or bus...lol).	1
	someone coming out of a camry, azera or altima (or anything small) would find the ride in the a6 to be eyeopening in that it would set a new standard for them.	1
	however...if i expect someone driving an a8, 7-series or s-class to relate to how comfortable and supple the ride is, they'll laugh, shake their head and probably say, 'if you think that's where it's at, wait till you drive one of these.'	1
	it's all subjective and it depends on which end of the spectrum you come from.       	1

	'ran our long-term 2009 hyundai genesis sedan to vegas and back from l.a. on saturday for the final round of the supercross championship.	1
	as a long distance machine, the genny excels, happily eating freeway miles as the soft first portion of the suspension's travel makes for a cushy cruiseliner.	1
	this not-quite floaty ride combines with solid straight-line stability, light steering, amply adjustable seat/wheel, an impressively quiet cabin (even in severe desert crosswinds) and solid audio quality to form a mile-eating cocoon.	1
	though tuned for the masses and not enthusiasts, the genesis doesn't embarrass itself when given the cane on desert backroads, and the v6 provides thoroughly adequate hustle.	1
	when pushed through its soft veneer, this big rear-wheel-drive sedan actually hunkers down reasonably well.	1
	the brake pedal is surprisingly firm, but it lacks a proper dead pedal.	1
	the light steering is accurate even if the wheel is a little thin, and the front seats feel more rubbery than leather-like, but overall the genesis chassis provides a very livable compromise between ride quality (on the soft side) and control. '	1

	thost that truly love the way an avalon rides and handles, will definitely want to drive a genesis.	1
	those that want a more sporty feeling handle with luxury accoutrements, at a much lower price than comparable cars of premium makes...then the genesis will be their cup of tea.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4684#msg4684re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [captain2]         the genesis would seem to me a quite capable competitor to something like the softly sprung avalon ltd                                it absolutely is.	1
	for the record i noticed some of the same 'quirks' in the genesis tranny as in the avalons.	1
	this stuff is becoming the norm unfortunately.	1
	as for the ride comparison, one is pillow soft with numb handling the other is tight with improved road feel.	1
	like allmet just said, its just a matter of what the person is looking for in a car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4685#msg4685re: bumpiness of ride on genesis [allmet33]        the avalon in any trim has only got a lot of power but is anything but 'sporty' in terms of ride and handling.	1
	much like your azera and both in common with the genesis.	1
	it is with that softness that the apparently nasty behavior is coming from - not because it is  anything that anyboy who wants 'a sporty feel' would like.	1
	that guy will buy something else, perhaps a g8 for less or heaven forbid one of those nasty german brands if he truly weants the best.	1
	lexus can manage to offer the softness that americans seem to like without  any sort of uncontrolled behavior, the germans, of course, can slant much more towards a truly sports sedan while still managing a car that is wa wonderful highway cruiser.	1
	the genesis is no bmw or ftm a lexus - at least not yet.	1
	judging by some complaints from some posters here as well as some professional reviewers : it seems that  -  for those that want a sporty feel the genesis is not anybody's 'cup of tea'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4687#msg4687ride        fwiw now that i have my genesis, i feel like all i have done in the 50 or so miles i have put on it, is analyze the ride.	1
	i just can't fault it at all (and i've tried on my test drive).	1
	anyway, i guess to anyone looking to purchase one try it out with an open mind and make your own judgements.	1
	if you are looking for a park avenue/lincoln town car/avalon ride it may not be for you.	1

	its a genesis and not one of the other cars its often compared to.	1
	im just not sure whats up with the complaints, is it buyers remorse?	1
	i did my homework and comparisons, and this car gave me way more bang for the buck, i am under no illusion that im in a lexus or a bmw,or any other luxury car.	1
	i am in a hyundai genesis and the ride along with everything else in the car is more than i could have gotten some other place  for the money i paid.	1
	so i guess for those that dont like this car you can sell it or give it back and spend a lot more money for almost same car.	1
	well those are my thoughts........i could be wrong but it works for me and im happy and would recommend this car to anyone and would do it all over again.	1

	you will love it more and more.	1
	also let me assure you that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the suspension...0 (zero) problems.	1

	let me share a couple of pet peeves of mine with the genesis:                1. the tires (they suck) noisy on the road                2. the vent outer ring is shinny (sun reflects off of it and blinds you)                3. avg miles per gallon resets everytime you fill up!	1
	i'd like to reset it if i wish too!	1
	4. the scrolling of songs is slow!	1
	going from artist 'b'  to say artist 's' takes too long.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4693#msg4693re: ride [sergio19]        thanks sergio!	1
	the avg mpg resetting on fill up is something that i am used to in my avalon.	1
	what's funny is that there are several people that have complained about it in the avalon forum too.	1
	i haven't noticed the tires being too noisy, but compared to the tires i had on the av they seem ok.                                as for the scrolling, yes it is a bit slow even on mine without the tech pkg.	1
	i just set it to 'all songs' and pressed the 'random' button and it shuffles through all my songs which is what i am used to.	1
	one minor issue i have is that the auto headlights have no delay after shutting off the car.	1
	when the sales manager called me to thank me for my purchase i asked them to check if it could be programmed to do so.	1
	he told me that they had been through it before and its not customizable.	1
	on my previous toyotas they could hook up a scan tool and change things like that to the customer's preferences.	1

	on the other hand it is not really sporty with taut handling like the bmw.	1
	the genesis tried to be a bit of both ....                i think hyundai should have aimed more at the lexus crowd as folks buying bmw buy it just for the nameplate and the ride.they would never shift to hyundai.lexus buyers,,again image conscious and nameplate buyers,,would probably atleast have a look and give a chance to genesis.	1
	having said that ,it is a terrific bang for the buck--decent agility ,,plush interior,,very quiet cabin,good handling ,quality fit and finish--all for 20k less.	1
	for a first attempt,hyundai did a remarkable job.even lexus was not that good in 1990....so it can only get better for genesis,,hopefully sales pick up..                also good competition to lexus/bmw...keeps them sharp..--win win for the buyers!!	1
	definitely on top of my shopping list in 2 years!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4699#msg4699re: a combination of plush and sporty [deltheking]        the new genesis costs just the about same the lexus did in 1989 yet with all the new technology and safety features.	1
	that would be 65-70k in todays dollars.	1
	a lexus was considered a bargain compared to european luxury at the time.	1
	it makes you appreciate the genesis even more       	1

	i was thinking about ordering them, but since its leased i may not.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4701#msg4701re: a combination of plush and sporty [toye]        my feelings exactly!	1
	i've been a bmw 7  5 owner since 1989..i know bm'ers.	1
	i retired this year and my 745 lease was up.	1
	i priced out the 750 and the cost was close to $80,000!	1
	being retired i had a tough time spending that much.	1
	i leased my genny 3.8 tech in august, on that cheap 2 year lease because it's a new car.	1
	i'm glad i did because it's the finest car i've owned for less than $42,000.	1
	i do not have any issues with the ride.	1
	yes, it's not a 750, but for half the price it's a great ,quiet, controlled luxury ride [or at least mine does].	1
	when my lease is up i'll get another in a heart beat.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4702#msg4702re: ride [tjc78]        they are very reasonable on ebay and they complement the genesis.	1
	it's worth it on your beautiful new automobile.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4704#msg4704re: a combination of plush and sporty [mmcoy75]        perhaps soon you will be able to trade it on a new hyundai equus.	1
	hyundai has plans to bring over 100 of them and place them around at various dealers.	1
	they want to gauge the reaction to these super luxury cars in the u.s.                                they are seriously considering bringing it over to complete with the mercedes s class, bmw 750 and lexus ls.	1
	u.s. cost would be about $75,000.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4705#msg4705re: a combination of plush and sporty [houdini1]        i highly doubt that hyundai will tag the prestige (equus) with a $75k price.	1
	more than likely, it would slot above the genesis between $45-55k.	1
	hyundai has made some waves with the genesis, no doubt.	1
	however, hardly enough to warrant anyone in the u.s. plopping down $75k for a hyundai.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4706#msg4706re: a combination of plush and sporty [houdini1]        although the equus is bigger and more luxurious than the genesis, i think the genesis has a noticably better interior design.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4707#msg4707re: a combination of plush and sporty [mmcoy75]        it was the first blk/blk with the tech package in my area.	1
	all of our friends love the car and some wish they didn't pay $75-80,000 for their benz's and bm'ers!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4708#msg4708re: a combination of plush and sporty [toye]        yeah, but the exterior lines on the equus/prestige are so much nicer than the genesis.	1
	they did just enough to give it an identity and break it away from that neutral look that they complain about on the genesis.	1
	well, not really complain about, but the fact that it can pass as a few other vehicles out there if you're not really paying attention.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4709#msg4709re: a combination of plush and sporty [allmet33]        you got a point.	1
	the equus is better on the outside but let me tell you my genesis (with the wings) is a head turner everywhere i go.	1
	people stop and ask all sort of questions and compliment the style, interior and exterior.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4710#msg4710re: a combination of plush and sporty [toye]        trust me...i believe you on that.	1
	whenever i see one around it catches my eye for sure.	1
	there's one in my area where the guy already had the windows tinted and he put some aftermarket wheels on it and it looks really, really slick!	1
	the genesis, hands down is really a beautiful car and i say beautiful in terms of who created it.	1
	i thought my azera was 'it' at the time, but when they dropped the genesis, i was like...'whoa!'	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4711#msg4711re: a combination of plush and sporty [allmet33]        the genesis turns heads not just only the hyundai loyalists (like myself) but everyone else.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4713#msg47132009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check        i have an offer from the dealer for the following:                                 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus                (18' wheels, 14 speaker lexicon system, leather trim, etc)                                 $29,000 out the door                (includes taxes, tags, registration, everything).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4715#msg4715re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        200 miles really isn't a big deal, the car still gets every aspect of the warranty.	1
	the question is...how do you feel about it.	1
	i mean...they seemed to have knocked a little $$$ off the price to offset the 200 miles.	1
	it could have been the demo car or it could have been driven by the store manager/owner for a couple weeks.	1
	you know they like to do that sometimes.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4716#msg4716re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        yes yes yes its a great deal,i paid 8% tax so thats a couple thousand $.if ur really lookin 4a deal this is it imho btw its a great car for my money and i love driving it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4717#msg4717re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [allmet33]        i really like it.	1
	i'm just trying to figure out how he is letting it go out the door for around                 $27500 + tax                .	1
	invoice is around                 $33k                .	1
	can anyone offer any possible explanation?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4718#msg4718re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        more than likely, the fact that it's got the 200 miles on it...it's really hard to sell it for full price when most folks take owner ship with one that has less than 30 miles on it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4719#msg4719re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        yes the invoice is really a guideline.......consumer report has a subscription  you can get for $14.00 and it tells the real deal.......what the dealer really has 2pay for the car you are looking at,and not what they want you to think.this being said it is still really a good deal,when i bought mine i was gonna go 2 maine to save a little over 2 thousand dollars.after i thought about it and priced in the flight cost,hotels,gas etc.	1
	and driving 2500 miles i decided to buy local.i am happy with the deal i got and in some small way helped my local economy.i paid more than his deal but im happy.we only know what we are told and as unusual as it would be when ppl are in a bind for money many strange things happen.	1
	i quit second guessing myself a long time ago......it was a battle i couldn't win.	1

	most dealers wouldn't let a demo go for that.	1
	there has got to be trade that is being under valued or something.	1
	c'mon even with holdback there is a few thousand dollars the dealer is losing.	1
	now, if the vehicle has been titled, or repaired in some way that is a different story.       	1

	why?	1
	it was probably a dealer trade.	1
	my new genesis had over 300.  it had to be brought in from another dealer (in another state, no less).	1
	it was my only option to get what i wanted.	1
	my last car was the same way.	1
	i'm sorry this 'deal' must have missing information or the dealer is on a mission to clear out some inventory to hit a bonus.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4725#msg4725here comes the equus!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4727#msg4727re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [houdini1]        that was the no trade - out the door price.	1
	i just went back in today and the sales manager told me he couldn't sell it for that price.	1
	i even had financing this morning and walked in with the loan approval letter and the check for the downpayment.	1
	he gave me some crap about not having enough advertising money to cover that big of a difference between invoice and selling price.	1
	obviously i am beyond disappointed/angry with how this was handled.	1
	i talked to the other sales manager and confirmed that the first sales manager had outright lied to me when he gave me the $29k written offer.	1
	i'm not really sure what to do at this point.	1
	i wrote an email to the general manager of the dealership.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4728#msg4728re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        sorry to hear about your situation.	1
	it sounded to good to be true...unless there was something wrong with it.	1
	i do believe that the genesis brand will be the first hyundai to really hold their value.	1
	to bad you didn't take the car on the spot yesterday it may have been another story and they may have had to eat some crow or somebody out of a job!!!	1
	3.8 premium goes for 34-35k before taxes if i'm not mistaken.	1

	maybe there was a misunderstanding about whether or not the out the door price included the taxes, etc.	1
	i would keep an open mind.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4730#msg4730re: here comes the equus!	1
	[fxguy]        district parts  service manager mentioned to me that hyuundai is going to be selling a $75,000 car, equus, in the us.	1
	i think all these new vehicles will eventually hurt hyundai and the owners.	1
	3 years ago, they really pushed the azera; 2 years ago, it was the vera cruz; last year, it was the genesis sedan; this year it is the genesis coupe and next year it will be the equus.	1
	they then ignore the previous vehicles.	1
	no wonder the azera and vera cruz sales have plummeted-no marketing.	1
	this has also affected resale values and the same thing will happen to genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4731#msg4731re: here comes the equus!	1
	[carolinabob]        thanks for your opinion but i don't buy it regarding the genesis...                                first, yes the sales for the azera have plummeted...nice car...but not enough distance from the genesis in price.	1
	most people if they are stepping up from a sonata will skip the azera and go  into the genesis.	1
	veracruz sales are up.... wouldn't be surprised if they put it under the genesis name on the next generation.	1
	genesis name is quickly becoming into its own.	1
	people are associating the brand with luxury and hyundai is quite aware of this and this is why they have already begun plans to sub-brand genesis from hyundai.	1
	the name 'genesis' for me has always met much more than a  specific name for a car..but a luxury automobile brand much like lexus, infinitity, and now genesis.	1
	the product fits the name.	1
	equus doesn't have the name genesis has and it will become the flagship of the genesis brand.	1
	they won't sell a lot of them..(at 75k only a select few will) but they will bring more status for the korean car maker.	1
	hyundai is a very aggressive and smart car company.	1
	toyota, honda, nissan and the european crowd are closely watching their backs.	1
	bottom line, thank hyundai for bringing more quality and value to consumers as it forces all the players to try to do the same.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4732#msg4732re: here comes the equus!	1
	[carolinabob]         'hyundai is going to be selling a $75,000 car, equus, in the us.'	1
	the (unsubstantiated) story i read merely says hyundai will ship 100 cars to us dealers to gauge reactions.	1
	no talk of 'selling' them, and no mention of price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4733#msg4733re: here comes the equus!	1
	[toye]         'they have already begun plans to sub-brand genesis from hyundai...equus doesn't have the name genesis has and it will become the flagship of the genesis brand.'	1
	iirc, hyundai management considered creating a luxury brand called genesis for the north american market a few years ago, but abandoned the idea.	1
	and as i said above, hyundai has no current plans to sell the equus in north america.	1
	unless you are on the hyundai motor group executive board and are leaking corporate secrets, i think your post is speculative fiction at best.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4734#msg4734re: here comes the equus!	1
	[fedlawman]        of course it an opinion!	1
	but numerous news reports last month said the hyundai wants to sub brand the genesis within a couple years, now yesterday they announced out of now where that they are bringing 100 equus to local dealerships.	1
	this company is aggressive and has plenty of money.	1
	don't be surprised if my scenario happens sooner than later.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4735#msg4735re: 2009 genesis 3.8 premium plus price check [rhyx]        there is another possibility which you may want to check out.	1
	check the build date of the car.	1
	if it's from last summer, i.e.	1
	before august it's possible the car was one of those used in the genesis test-drive tour around the u.s.  that may not be a big deal to you, but i did that test drive and the drivers were encouraged to flog the cars pretty hard.	1
	i know i did.	1
	anyway, just a thought that would account for the huge discount--used as an hma demo car, and built some time ago.       	1

	he said                 sell                , not test.	1
	also, based on what i have seen on hyundai think tank, it would appear hyundai is heading toward selling the car.	1
	they have already polled people on what name to use for the car when brought here to                 sell                .	1

	(dos) as for being a car for old folks my son (26) and his friends love this car.what they say is my car is really sick(thats a good thing)and i agree.when i got picky with any car i ever have had , i always found faults.......bmw,lexus,cady....etc...always found something.now  with my genesis i have found way less faults and what tips the scale in its favor  is cost and quality that imho cant be beat.....and now that im retired its time to plan my first road trip in my genesis.	1

	yes, but i think its cool you can swing a car in that price category at 30!	1
	i think i probably would've opted for the g35 or more realistically, a used 3-series myself.	1
	i realize that is a different category of vehicle that is better suited to my needs, but i think the genesis is a great package and a great value.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4754#msg4754public reaction to my genesis        just want to share with you guys what has been happening to me with my genesis v6 black on black fully loaded recently.	1
	i purchased and installed the front and rear emblems this week, and since then, people see my car and initially ask 'what is that'  then they say 'is that a bentley'?	1
	i tell them it's a genesis and they always say wow that is a nice car.	1
	yesterday (friday may 15) i had to go into the city (nyc) to visit clients, i parked at a parking garage (more like parking apartment it was so small,lol) anyway when i finish my business and head back to my office i give the attendant my ticket and he asks me, how does the car ride?	1
	i said sweet as hell,lol he said man sittin in that car is like sittin in a benz, what is that?	1
	i said it's a genesis, i don't tell people too much that its' a hyundai just to see their reactions.	1
	then, on my way back, on the parkway a guy in an audi a6 came up next to me (while driving 40 miles an hour mind you) and asks me what is it that i'm driving?	1
	i said it's a genesis and he said it looks good and he is thinking of getting a new car and would consider this one.	1
	this kind of reaction happens more and more through out the day, i think hyundai has missed a golden opportunity here, i think if they really wanted to get their name out in the marketplace grassroots style, they would have the dealerships offer early bird incentives to the first come buyers, they would offer discounts on the car if the buyer went out and 'markets' the car for the dealership, when people ask what car it is and stuff like that, they will refer them to the dealerships.	1
	there will be plenty of people (as i can attest to) who will be willing to buy based on looking at the car of the person they are talking to.	1
	what do you guys think?       	1

	after 2 months with the genesis v6, i still find the ride very quiet, i went to bar harbor, maine, last week-end, after a fill up at errol village i did an average of 6.6l/100km for few hours, unbelievable.	1
	i was very gentle on the throttle.	1

	if you are going to comment here and criticize some of us (see your post #4740 here), you should visit the think tank to see what hyundai is saying and doing.	1
	get your facts before you criticize.	1
	the equus is coming.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4774#msg4774tiring to hear suspension related complaints        the fact is this about the genesis ride/suspension/bouncy ride etc.	1
	it is made how it is made so you either like it or you don't.	1
	go to bmw forums and you will see similiar type of complaints yet bimmers are considered some of the sportiest cars around.	1
	go to the toyota/lexus forums and while you don't see such complaints as much you also hear people disappointed about their cars handling/steering feel etc.	1
	its not rocket science to know that if a rwd car has some sport it also has a stiffer suspension setup and some bounce when driving on bad roads will happen.	1
	so lets not expect the genesis to be a 100 k car and be able to be sporty but also swallow up that pot hole perfectly (even bmw, mercedez etc.	1
	can't do it)                                i have had this car for a few months now and it is a dream.	1
	it is not perfect but it is darn good.	1
	it is a head turner whereever i go.	1
	the only pet peeve i have is that hyundai should have badged this car as a genesis (they didn't have to open a new network of genesis dealers but just have a special section at hyundai dealers just selling genesis cars).	1

	let's review...                                on may 8th, 'fxguy' posted:                 'looks like hyundai is bring the big brother of the genesis to the us to gauge reaction.'	1
	he attached a link to a hyundaifans.com forum that states:                 'yep, its coming folks!!	1
	the good folks at hyundai usa have decided to bring the mighty equus to america!	1
	starting this summer, a run of about 100 will be available for viewing at selected hyundai dealers across the country.	1
	test drives are probably out of the question but at least we will be able to see and hopefully sit in them.	1
	if public reaction is favorable, it is almost certain that hyundai will start selling them over here possibly in early 2010.'	1
	then on may 9th, you replied to 'fxguy' and said:                 'district parts  service manager mentioned to me that hyuundai is going to be selling a $75,000 car, equus, in the us.'	1
	later that day, i pointed out that the story was unsubstantiated and said nothing about selling the car.	1
	in response, you said to me,                 'what i heard came from a hyundai regional employee who found out about it in their office.	1
	he said sell, not test.'	1
	i don't need to visit a think tank or do any research to conclude that the decision to sell the equus in the us has not been made yet.	1

	not only has a final decision not been made by hyundai motor america (hma) with regards to the equus's entry into the us market (thus the whole pr pushing for the 100 demo units at various dealers across the us, the 75k starting price tag is nothing short of an internet rumor.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4783#msg4783re: here comes the equus!	1
	[choe13]        agreed.	1
	hyundai will have to price the equus (probably not its us name) at substantially less than the least expensive ls460 at $62k in order to sell it.	1
	if it's anywhere near $60k, i would go for the lexus.	1
	the hyundai may be very close to the lexus in quality and refinement (hopefully), but hyundai won't be able to touch the lexus in customer service, resale value, and very probably, the public's perception of a luxury car.	1
	the genesis may serve to preliminarily dispell or confirm these perceptions.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4784#msg4784re: here comes the equus!	1
	[kenb757]         ...hyundai won't be able to touch the lexus in customer service, resale value, and very probably, the public's perception of a luxury car.	1
	unless hyundai goes on a serious blitz to upgrade the dealers in the department of customer service.	1
	i've seen a difference at the dealer i go to, but i can't say the same changes are taking place at all of them.	1
	hyundai needs to create a standard by which all dealers must follow so that service can be consistent from one dealer to the other.	1
	resale value, considering it's starting out less than a lexus, it will always be worth less than a lexus.	1
	however, do a comparison in regards to the % of value lost and you'll be surprised that the numbers are quite close.	1
	i did this very same thing in comparing the azera to the avalon, there was only a couple of % points difference between the two.	1
	i think the genesis is starting to wake a few folks up and even turn a few nay-sayers around.	1
	if hyundai was smart, they would have started with the azera to show that hyundai can at least show flashes of luxury and then the genesis would have been received much more openly.	1
	since the azera wasn't put out there like it should have been, folks really didn't know much about it and how hyundai made the leap from the sonata to the genesis.       	1

	this is the same thing that happened before the genesis dropped.	1
	currently, everything is speculation until hyundai posts something factual.	1
	for anyone to say that the equus/prestige would be priced around $75k...they must have their heads someplace it really doesn't belong.	1
	i'm sure hyundai paid attention to the demise of the vw phaeton and the reasons behind it.	1
	there is no way hyundai could justify a price jump of +$30k from a $40k genesis to a $75k equus/prestige.	1
	heck, even as a hyundai fan...i would laugh at that.	1
	the more sensible price point would be for it to start in the mid to upper $40k's and top out around the mid $50k's                                however, until hyundai puts out a newsletter or something stating facts on a u.s. version of the equus, we will all be speculating...don't you think?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4788#msg4788equus        top up at mid 50's??	1
	hyundai is a car company not santa claus.	1
	this car with no brand name associated with it would be worth mid 50's starting at min.	1
	the materials in this car are premium and the craftmanship of the highest quality.	1
	you slap on a lexus badge and it would be hard to tell that it was not a lexus       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4789#msg4789re: equus [choe13]        yes...top out in the mid $50k's.	1
	they would have to to bring it under the lexus ls.	1
	you talk about premium materials along with fit  finish, look at the genesis.	1
	it reviews out as having just as good fit  finish as most premium sedans (if not better than some) along with the use of premium materials (except for the lack of real wood) and it tops out in the low $40k's.	1
	why would it be so hard to believe the next step up would top out in the mid to upper $50k's???	1
	dont' get me wrong, the genesis has opened the eyes of many in regards to hyundai bringing a luxury sedan to market, but not enough to make the masses believe in paying +$60k for a hyundai.	1
	sorry...won't happen.       	1

	[carolinabob]         'i gave you two sources - one a regional employee of hyundai and the other the official hyundai think tank, where national officials participate in sessions and discussions.'	1
	sorry, last time i checked, middle managers don't set (or announce) corporate policy.	1
	unless one of these sources is named mong koo chung (or maybe john krafcik), you're just drinking cool-aid.	1
	'you have zero sources for your opinion.'	1
	well, i do have one source - the hyundai usa official website.	1
	if you can find a single reference to the equus (or equivalent premium sedan) being sold in the us anywhere on the website, you'll have my humblest of apologies.	1

	[fedlawman]        the official hyundai website is way behind whatever is actually happening.	1
	it is there for what is being done now, not what is planned.	1
	even the future vehicles portion, if there, is not accurate.	1
	btw, middle managers do know what is happening because they hear it from the corporate hq.	1
	also, the hyundai think tank is a source and john krafcik has participated in sessions, discussed the equus and knows what has been said on it.	1
	btw, it's kool aid, with a k.                                i would think someone in law enforcement would know that a source that does not say something does not mean it is not true.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4793#msg4793re: here comes the equus!	1
	[carolinabob]        i think the other poster meant to post this site:                 http://www.hyundainews.com/                - official hyundai motor america (hma) media site.	1
	regardless, the equus has not been finalized for us delivery.	1
	yes, there have been a lot of discussions and chatters (and back and forth between hmc and hma                ), but no final decision has been made, yet.	1
	while the possibility is there and a good one, i wouldn't put the middle manager, or think tank, for the matter, as the sources of all things.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4794#msg4794allmet33        once again get real about the pricing.	1
	hyundai will follow the cost model lexus follows and wont start this car at low 40's like you think                                the gs starts at 45 and ls 63 k .	1
	thats almost 20 k in price differential.	1
	you think hyundai is crazy enough to only ask starting 45 k for the equus?	1
	3                                the equus will prob only come in two variants and i can't see it starting lower than 49k but with options etc reach as highest low 60's                                hyundai is bringing only 1000 and not necessarily planning to sell the car rather than market the hyundai badge.	1
	(so they won't be desperate to lower the price)                                btw please stop with the for a hyundai crap.	1
	are you serious??	1
	people said the same thing about the genesis and how they would never buy a 30k plus for a hyundai and these same people are looking like fools at the moment       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4795#msg4795re: allmet33 [choe13]        choe13...you're right about the genesis, a lot of folks claimed the car wouldn't sell being priced as high as $40k for the 4.6 and it is.	1
	however, if you look at the pricing scale for hyundai, the jump from sonata to azera is almost nil a fully loaded sonata tops out right around where the azera starts, the genesis starts off a little bit higher than where a fully loaded azera ends.	1
	why would it be hard to believe the equus/prestige would start out in the mid-upper $40k's and stop fully loaded in the mid-upper $50k's???	1
	the sonata starts out around $18k, the azera around $24k and the genesis around $33k...starting the equus off around $47k makes total sense.	1
	i mean...hyundai is hitting a few makes over the head with the genesis at the price point it's at.	1
	i mean...to get a lexus, infinity or any other premium brand sedan option out like a genesis...you're going to spend at least $12k more.	1
	why would they stop that line of thinking on the next model???	1
	if anything, this is hyundai's opportunity to show that lightning can strike twice and maybe with what they've learned with the release of the genesis, show strides in getting it more right than the first time.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4796#msg4796allmet33        like i stated hyundai is going to follow lexus pricing model and differential close to 20 k from the genesis to the equus.	1
	once again compare the gs and ls which are basically the genesis and equus respectively.	1
	i understand what you are saying but don't forget the ls is close to 20k as good as the gs.	1
	even the basic version is fully loaded, uses real wood trim, more luxurious leather seating fabric, and of course the gadgetary works.	1
	the equus is going to have at least 80 percent gadgets like auto parking, lane change warning in addition uses real wood, real leather and use some kind of crazy audio system.	1
	we are not really different in our estimation on how much the equus will top out but for me i think it will close or slightly over 60 k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4797#msg4797re: here comes the equus!	1
	[carolinabob]         'the official hyundai website is way behind whatever is actually happening.	1
	it is there for what is being done now, not what is planned.	1
	even the future vehicles portion, if there, is not accurate.'	1
	ok bob, you're right.	1
	why on earth would hyundai want to use their official website to announce the release of their flagship car to the us market?	1
	what was i thinking?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4798#msg4798re: allmet33 [choe13]        you could very well be right, but until hyundai starts putting out some factual information in regards to the u.s. version of the equus, it will all be speculation.	1
	however, with what the genesis has shown us so far, the equus will be highly anticipated to say the least.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4799#msg47991st hand info on the equus        okay...i just got off the phone with my service guy at the dealership i go to.	1
	he informed me that the hyundai's president of n. america ops.	1
	came through riding in the new equus.	1
	in his words, 'all that and a bag of chips.'	1
	he told me that the rear seats are heated  cooled, and are much bigger than the rear seats in the genesis.	1
	also, there are fold down tables that come out of the back of the front seats, and a rear dvd entertainment system.	1
	he also said that not only does it have the sun shade that comes up on the rear window, but also the rear side windows as well.	1
	i asked him what his opinion was about sticker price and he feels that it will be in the ball park of the low to mid-$60k's.	1
	he also gave notice that the new sonata looks better than the current azera, but that the azera will be getting tweaked as well and not being phased out as of yet.	1
	okay...that's the dish i'm serving on this beautiful friday before memorial day weekend!	1

	that is no big deal.	1

	sure...it's no big deal when it can be an option...we are talking standard equipment my friend.	1
	the side rear screens...not manual, but power.	1
	you also failed to mention the fold down trays for the rear seat riders that are found in the maybach, jag xj vanden plas and a couple other cars of that ilk.	1
	when you start comparing something like an lexus ls (any version) to the equus, $60k+ will seem like a bargain!!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4808#msg4808re: 1st hand info on the equus [allmet33]        yeah, i guess a power sun shade is well worth $30k extra.	1
	the fold-down trays are also standard on a 747.  how much does one of those babies cost?	1
	that makes the equus look like the bargain of the century!!	1
	now, if they can put goodies like power sun shades and fold-down trays in the equus,                 plus                nail the ride/handling dynamics so no one will think to say, 'oh well... it was a great deal after all,' that would be really great.       	1

	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4810#msg4810re: 1st hand info on the equus [allmet33]        keep in mind it takes no special engineering skill to stick a sunshade or fold-down tray in a car (making a sturdy, ergonomic tray is important though).	1
	best-in-class ride, handling, braking, nvh levels, power with economy etc.--                 those                are harder.	1
	the genesis sedan does very well in most of those areas, but for a starting price of $33k most buyers aren't expecting perfection.	1
	for $50-60k, though, i don't think buyers will be as forgiving.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4811#msg4811re: 1st hand info on the equus [backy]        once again, you're absolutely right...it's the fact that many of those things are reserved for the high end, luxury cars made by the premium makers.	1
	so...like the genesis, the pricing does allow room for forgiveness with it's so-called lacking perfection...the same would hold true for the equus.	1
	however, the public may expect more now knowing what hyundai is actually capable of.	1
	so in that regards, they have to get a little closer to 'pefection' than their first venture into the luxury segment afforded them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4812#msg4812genesis quality levels        genesis cars shouldn't really be mixed with the same quality levels as other hyundai cars just like you can't say an acura is honda in terms of quality.	1
	even though the genesis does contain a flying h on its back it is no doubt 10-15 points higher in quality.	1
	jd power dependability study 2009 had hyundai at above avg ratings of 161 problems for every 100 vehicle (even beating bmw) with lexus and toyota near the top from 126 problems and 129 problems respectively etc.	1
	i think the genesis will reach the 150 rating easily and that would put it near honda's and acuras rating level which very respectively.	1
	(honda no doubt associated with quality)                                the point i'm trying to make is that perfection is not expected from the genesis but i'll bet it is closer to it than most people might think it is(even those that own a genesis today)       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4813#msg4813re: 1st hand info on the equus [allmet33]        the comedian louis anderson tells a story about going with his dad to buy a christmas tree.	1
	the guy at the tree lot shows him a tree, his dad asks how much it is, and it's like $10 (this was a                 long                time ago).	1
	the dad exclaims, 'for $10, that tree ought to dance!!'	1
	for $50k-60k, that equus had better be pretty darn near perfect.	1
	i can pay a whole lot less for a car that is lacking perfection.	1
	i already own a few of those.	1
	the ls goes for $75k but is the closest thing to perfection ever tested by cr (99 points out of 100 on their scale).	1
	that is the goal i think hyundai should set for the equus--but for less money.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4814#msg4814re: 1st hand info on the equus [backy]        backy...i agree with you.	1
	like i said before, with what hyundai has shown with the genesis...i think they can move forward and get the little things right in the equus that are lacking in the genesis.	1
	i mean...the genesis really isn't that far off to be honest.	1
	the only real complaints i've read or heard is the ride (subjective), the missing cover under the rear deck and the lack of a cooled passenger seat.	1
	other than that...there really hasn't been much that folks have brought up in a negative context in regards ot the genesis.	1
	i hope that hyundai has been paying attention to what has been said in various forums and by various auto reviewers.	1
	i do agree that the lexus ls should be the benchmark that they shoot for when it comes to the equus.	1
	i mean, it certainly wears its sheetmetal quite nicely.	1
	we can only hope it's demeanor is what it should be for a $60k+ vehicle.       	1

	[carolinabob]        a friend of mine in washington d.c. (i can't reveal his identity because he's a high ranking member of the obama administration) told me the president and treasury secretary are proposing a federal tax rebate for fiscal year 2010. in it's current stage, it consists of an $800 - $1,200 rebate for single filers ($1,600 - $2,400 for married couples filing jointly).	1
	it also includes $1,000 per child per household.	1
	the rebates will be reduced progressively for single filers earning more $75,000 ($110,000 for married couples).	1

	since there is not much to report this time that i have not said in my previous posts, i will only mention the highlights:                *  rock-solid build quality.	1
	*  roomy, comfortable, well appointed interior.	1
	*  great ride on smooth roads ... stiff, bouncy ride on rough streets.	1
	no, it is not just 'perception'.	1
	in hyundai's efforts to make it 'sporty', they failed to make the ride firm but compliant.	1
	*  corners nice and flat in the mountain curves                *  terrific engine for a v-6 ... very quick, great torque.	1
	first time i have ever considered a v-8 to be superfluous ... and i have driven the v-8 genesis.	1
	*  great transmission, especially for spirited driving.	1
	*  excellent highway gas mileage for such a big car (28 to 31 mpg at 80 mph).	1
	*  contrary to some other posts, i am pleased with the original tires.	1
	i keep them rotated but have never had them balanced and they are still 100% vibration free.	1
	i will make it to at least 35k before they are down to the wear indicators (or to the top of abe lincolns head).	1
	the only reason i may switch to michelins is to see if the ride improves on rough streets.	1
	not that anyone will care, but i am losing interest in this forum.	1
	it has evolved into useless chatter about the rumored equus rather than informative, factual genesis owner experiences.	1
	i am surprised that the hosts are not directing the equus discussion to a separate forum.	1
	just my perspective!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4829#msg4829re: improvements [palmsprings]        wow...you sure want a lot for the little money you're spending (in comparison to the cars of the premium makes).       	1

	great info.	1
	credible personal experience with genesis is exactly what i'm looking for.	1
	looking forward to your next 5000 mile report.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4831#msg4831re: great article in orange county register about hyundai [bobad]         all they need to do is allot genesis and equus only to dealers that are equipped and willing to dispense premium service.	1
	now this might actually work if they can figure out some way to effectively segregate the customers at the qualifying dealers imo.	1
	there is something about buyers that can put that kind of money up for a car - they are uncomfortable surrounded by those folks that have difficulty figuring out a way to qualify to buy a $10k accent (or whatever).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4832#msg4832re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [colegar]        thanks for update and please let us know about change of tires.	1
	i got my genesis in january but only have 2780 miles so its gonna take me awhile before i need to change tires.	1
	btw i agree with you comment about the rambles about the equus but, sometimes chat sites need to grow and figure out how it works.	1
	so i hope you stay with us.	1
	i sure understand your feelings about the ride on rough streets, but for me i still find it acceptable.	1
	dont get me wrong i wouldnt complain if it was smoother, i just feel that its not a deal breaker 4me.as i have said before i love this car, after buying my first new car in 1969 as you can imagine i have had many, many cars over the years.	1
	my last car was a sts cady,and have owned bmw,lexus,lincolns....etc.what i have discovered about this car is that 4my money its gotta be one of the best if not the best.	1
	great style,quality,and more.	1
	i will admit its not perfect but i really have no major complaints and the price made it even more attractable.	1
	for a comparison recently i drove a few different (borrowed)luxury cars on the same route a few times and do feel the difference in the ride and the way the cars took the bumps, in fact they were all different but most were what i would say is acceptable.	1
	its almost the same as when i see a beautiful girl, at first i see her as perfect and as time goes on i find 'flaws' which i have come to believe live mostly in my head.	1
	(i mean no disrespect to women with this comment, the same could be said about a painting or other things)so thats my take on the car and i hope to hear from more owners about their own experiences with the genesis.	1
	miklo       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4833#msg4833re: great article in orange county register about hyundai [captain2]        captain, maybe those accent buyers are future genesis owners.	1
	what's wrong with future genesis owners?	1
	you may be one yourself!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4834#msg4834re: great article in orange county register about hyundai [bobad]        imo the 'usual' hyundai dealer remains a serious obstacle for those buyers that might expect more for their 30 or 40 large.	1
	not too long ago i was shopping the azera and was greeted by a 20 something know nothing salesman that seemed to only be acquainted with how cheap his products were relative to the avalon i drove up in, for example.	1
	it has seemed that hyundai is the training ground for newbie know nothing sales people since day one.	1
	irritating for me and not the way to sell a relatively expensive automobile imo.	1
	and you are right - if i can see my way past the way the genesis is sold -  i might even figure out a way to buy one        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4835#msg4835re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [colegar]        bonjour colegar,                                i hope you will be keep posting for two reasons;                1- because you help me to buy my genesis 2 months ago, like many people my mental perception of hyundai versus lexus, mb, bmw is present and not as positive as i we like.	1
	and to spend $40k on a brand name not as solid as others it took a few road test and people like you to covince me on this gamble.	1
	and for now i am very happy with this experience of the sedan-v6.	1
	2- because i am sure a lot of people prefer to read post and don't participate to forums, for those you might be helpful too.	1
	questions for you (2):                1- you seem to do a lot a mileage, are you using synthetic oil ?	1
	if yes what is your frequency for changing engien oil ?	1
	2- about tires, by what i read 'michelin mxv4' seem to be a good choice for you're new set.	1
	let us know what have you consider, and you're final choice when the moment will come to do the change                                for my self i am close to 5000 miles.	1
	nothing negative to claim, the ride is sporty like i fond in my road test, i accept it and prefer this ride then the es350 offer.	1
	i still got a little thing bother me, is the car still slighly pulling left on highwayt.	1
	the dealer said he fix it, but not sure of it.	1
	about that, yesterdar the check engine went up for 1 hour, but after putting gas in the car, the check engine went off....i thing my gas-cap was involve.	1
	hope to read you again at 30,000 miles                                merci       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4836#msg4836re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [gensiscan]        replying to gensiscan                                i agree with your overall perception of the genesis and how it stacks up against the competition.	1
	i am a happy owner but i try to be objective in my posts on this forum, both good and bad.	1
	beware of those who advocate that the genesis is either 'perfect' or 'a piece of junk'!	1
	in my opinion, it is the best bang for the buck for a luxury sedan.	1
	i do think that hyundai will have to tweak the suspension to make the ride more compliant on less than perfect roads.	1
	i would not want them to make it a mushy ride like a lincoln town car, etc, but i would like to see them simulate the ride of a 5-series bmw or even an e-class mercedes (i have owned both).	1
	i have no inside information, but i would bet that hyundai has already tweaked the suspension for 2010 model year.	1
	regarding oil, i have always used mobil 1 synthetic in previous cars that had recommended change intervals of 10,000 miles or above, or if they had oil monitoring systems like mercedes or bmw.	1
	however, since the recommended change interval for the genesis is only 7,500 miles, i use regular castrol oil.	1
	the engine is usually loafing along at approximately 1,800 rpm without any exorbitant heat or stress, so i think it is throwing money away to use synthetic oil.	1
	regarding tires, i would consider the michelin pilot hx mxm4.	1
	also, i have seen some good ratings for the pirelli pzero nero all season.	1
	the best way i have found to compare tires is on tirerack.com.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4837#msg4837re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [colegar]         well said and thanks for your input.i agree its not a perfect car,its just a really good car for the money imho.i am planning a road trip in my genesis in the near future and will give update.although i have seen many people say things that i think are way off base overall i have gotten some good info here.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4838#msg4838may genesis sale figures        genesis still sold over 2000 for may with very little incentives.	1
	every other car seems to have huge discounts and this says alot about genesis in this market.	1
	people are willing to pay for this automobile.	1
	this may mean that genesis is holding its value better than any hyundai before it.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4840#msg4840re: may genesis sale figures [toye]        holding its value?	1
	way too early to tell.	1
	don't forget the azera and vera cruz received extremely good reviews and were highly marketed by hyundai.	1
	values plumeted anyway.	1
	lots are being sold because it is a brand new model for hyundai and being offered at a low cost and has good reviews so far.	1
	based on this and other sites, it is also being discounted as much as, if not more, than its competitors, but not                 necessarily                by hyundai                 directly                .	1
	2000 divided by 50 states = 40 per state.	1
	probably an                 average                of 10 dealers per state = 4 cars each.	1
	not a lot of cars in reality.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4841#msg4841re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [colegar]        bonjour colegar,                                regarding your comment on engine oil, one question came up into my mind.	1
	you wrote '                 since the recommended change interval for the genesis is only 7,500 miles                '                                i stick for a while on 7500 miles interval.	1
	after contacting a dealer he told me that 3750 was the mileage recommend by hyunda for the engine oil change.	1
	so is your 7500 number, was determine by somebody or an owner manual ?	1
	or it was a typing error ?	1
	or is what you determine by yourself considering that the engine have a rpm most of the time under 2000rpm ?	1
	just wondering how you came up with this number ?	1
	have a good week-end.	1
	personnal comment on mister roger federer, i wish him good vibration for the roland-garros open.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4842#msg4842re: may genesis sale figures [carolinabob]         not a lot of cars in reality.	1
	i live in nj right outside philly (heavily populated) and i can count on one hand how many i have seen...  and one is my own and someone a few blocks over.	1
	i don't ever see the genesis being sold in huge volumes.	1
	just my opinion!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4843#msg4843re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [gensiscan]        the owners manual specifies the oil change interval to be 7,500 miles for 'normal' driving and conditions.	1
	i don't have my manual handy right now but i believe that the 3,750 mile interval that your dealer is referring to is only applicable under severe driving or conditions, i.e.	1
	frequently 'hot-rodding' your car or driving on dusty roads, etc.	1
	almost every dealer (including mine) will imply that you should get it serviced more than the factory stipulations.	1
	they will also try to sell you on things like fuel injection service at frequent intervals.	1
	most of the service writers are encouraged to sell the customer on as many services as they can without just flat-out lying.	1
	my guess is that the service department is the main source of income for most dealers, rather than the profit margin on new cars.	1
	today's cars (not just hyundai), combined with modern lubricant technology, facilitate much longer service intervals than in the old days when everyone was supposed to get the oil and filter changed every 2,000 miles.	1
	i should add the caveat that i am not a mechanic and so i do not pretend to be an authority on engines and drive trains.	1
	i do, however, drive a tremendous amount of miles and i really take care of my vehicles.	1
	i have never had any issues related to oil breakdown or abnormal engine wear.	1
	in fact, i can't even remember the last time i ever needed to add a quart of oil between factory recommended service schedules.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4844#msg4844re: 25,000 mile update (v-6 w/tech pack) [colegar]        i sure agree with your comments.strange i got a post card from my dealer that it was time to change the oil at 3000 miles,then i informed them that the dealer gives me free oil change at every 5000 miles for as long as i own the car.the owners manuel does say up to 7,500 miles for oil change,so i gues its a pick the one you like......lol.in fact im comfortable with getting my'free' oil change every 5000 mile from the dealer,and at that time he can try and sell me anything he wants to but wont be sucessful.........btw i love my new genesis and only have 2893 miles so i got awhile to go b4 5000.                                miklo       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4845#msg4845re: oil change interval]        chaniging oil at 3,000 miles is a con used by almost all car dealers these days.	1
	i have had ford, mazda, toyota, etc.	1
	dealers tell me every 3,000 miles regardless of use.	1
	i change it every 5,000 miles because it is easy to remember, but whatever the owners manual says is what is correct.	1
	you can add every 3,000 miles to the fuel injector cleaning, various 'flushings', etc.	1
	that dealers use now to try to rip us off.	1
	do only what the                 owners manual                calls for and you are 100% in compliance.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4846#msg4846re: oil change interval] [carolinabob]        i agree bob.	1
	even the manufacturers fudge a bit.	1
	they recommend 10w20 motor oil not because it's best for the engine, but to help them acheive the targeted cafe mileage standard.	1
	10w30 is better oil for normal use in my v6 sonata, and that's what i use.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4847#msg4847re: oil change interval] [carolinabob] [bobad]        if you live in a cold climate, a 10w-xx oil might be too thick for winter.	1
	during freezing weather, a 0w or 5w motor oil would be a better choice.	1
	here in the pacific nw, i use 0w-40 synthetic year-round in all of my cars (4 cyl bmw, 5 cyl volvo, 6 cyl ford).	1
	it's got me covered in the coldest of winter and the warmest of summer.       	1

	the new ipod works flawlessly.although this may not be a good fix for everyone its my experience.	1
	btw i gave my older ipod to a friends son because his got stolen.i know 3 or 4 hundred bucks for new unit may not be possible for everyone, but my guess is that its the newer units that they used for testing to see how it integrated with genesis.	1
	of course even the new ipod doesn't do everything i think it should do.it appears this is an area that they didn't spend a lot of time on or think it was a important issue.i feel they were wrong!	1
	everything including the ipod should work seamlessly and have all the bells,whistles, and gongs.i have around 800 tunes on my pod and it is a hassle to find things that i wanna hear right now.......yeah i know i can shuffle the tunes but that's not what i want.anyway it is a minor issue 2me but still an issue.	1

	while i have no doubt that hyundai is slowly but surely losing some of that korean car lustre (or lack of it) - also note that it is much much easier to have the 'highest gain in brand value' when you are starting at the bottom of the pack and have no place to go but up.	1
	honda and/or toyota could never compete in this kind of sweepstakes, could they?	1
	would love a link to the lease guide numbers you reference though.	1
	combine hyundai's traditional 'value' pricing along with some reasonable value retention and you really will have superior 'bang for the buck'.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4861#msg4861re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        bear in mind though as hyundai's value retention increases, so will the prices for new hyundais.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4866#msg4866re: may genesis sale figures [tjc78]        no, it doesn't count in 'manufacturer-to-consumer rebates.'	1
	that is a specific category of incentives, one in which anyone who buys/leases the car gets the rebate, no exceptions.	1
	there are many, many other kinds of incentives of course, such as the lease support you mentioned.	1
	but not everyone leases the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4867#msg4867re: may genesis sale figures [backy]        i have seen 'rebates' or other discounts from $3,000 on genesis to $7,000 off vera cruz.	1
	there are also other discounts out there that edmunds and others do not know about.	1
	in the april consumer reports, they ranked manufacturers.	1
	the two 'cons' for hyundai products are suspension and low resale value.	1
	it might change, but until it does, it hasn't.	1
	as regards somebody guessing at the value of a car at the end of the lease, that blew up in 2008 big time.	1
	that is why so many companies changed leasing rules and some stopped altogether.	1
	cars were coming back in off lease that were worth far less than they had guessed 2-4 years earlier.	1

	i've seen no evidence of that - hyundai remains (and problematically is expected to be)  the cheapest car is whatever class it supposedly competes in.	1
	while it is true that cheap now generally means cheap later, as long as folks go to a hyundai dealer expecting to pay less  for something then resale value will remain a problem.	1
	for hyundai to elevate itself into those upper ranks of value retention it will simply have to stop selling things just because they are cheaper and more specifically for what they are actually are.	1
	think of that honda or toyota dealer that comes across like: ' this is a honda (or toy) -  this is the best car on the planet -  and if you want it, this is what it costs and if you don't like or think you can do better with something else - be my guest.'	1
	honda and toyota specifically are quite successful selling cars in this manner - somehow i can't imagine hyundai ever be able to sell anything where price is not a primary consideration.	1
	the catch to all of this is that:  even though they already should be able to do stop selling things because they are 'cheap'; they can't because the consumer expects large discounts, rebates and/or cheap prices.	1
	in effect,  hyundai has made its own bed and this is part of the baggage that attached to the hyundai name,  unfortunately.	1
	the one other thing that really helps that resale value - after keeping those inital prices up - is an earned reputation for building a superior car (especially from a reliability perspective) something that also has not happened yet - hyundai's reliability scores are generally nothing to brag about - mid pack much like their residual values...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4872#msg4872re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        cheap now = cheap later is really a bad way of looking at it.	1
	i mean...if you want a true comparison...look at the difference by way of percentages and you'll see...the hyundai vehicles hold their own against the competition.	1
	we've had this discussion before and i showed the work up on that.	1
	the difference in percentage points was maybe 2-3 in favor of the other brands, but the point is...hyundai is close.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4873#msg4873re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]        yes, and i've already provided the numbers for the real-world price increases on hyundais over the past few years, either here or in a related discussion.	1
	so no need to cover that ground again.	1
	the evidence is there for anyone who is interested in seeing it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4874#msg4874re: may genesis sale figures [backy]        right!	1
	some folks are just stuck on the fact that since they spent more up front it's worth more later on.	1
	in their book, more is more no matter how you look at it.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4875#msg4875re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]         look at the difference by way of percentages                no, no, no.	1
	look at how much money you lost when you trade it in - gross dollars - not percentages - because those are the real $ spent to own anything.	1
	bmws do very well retaining a high percentage of their values but cost a relative fortune to drive.	1
	obviously because they cost so much initially.	1
	honda is running a ad campaign right now talking about how much cheaper a civic is to own than any other brand (referencing edmund's tco numbers)- how could that be when it is about the most expensive to buy?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4876#msg4876re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        you are absolutely right.	1
	you have to look at dollars vs. percentages.	1
	the more expensive the car, the better the 'percentages' look, while you might be losing more real money than with a less expensive car.       	1

	you don't need to be 'stuck' on anything but you just might have to have your hands on your ankles when you trade that hyundai branded product in.        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4880#msg4880re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        uh, no, it's not nonsense at all.	1
	i will illustrate with an example:                                genesis v6 sedan, purchase price $35,000.	1
	alternative car l, purchase price $45,000.	1
	depreciation of genesis over first 3 years (for purposes this example only!	1
	): 50%                depreciation of car l over first 3 years: 40%.	1
	well, well, we think, car l has much better retained value than the genesis!	1
	look at the percentages!	1
	not so.	1
	the buyer of the genesis lost $17,500 in depreciation over the first 3 years of ownership, while the buyer of car l lost $18,000.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4881#msg4881re: may genesis sale figures [toye]         the hyundai of the 80's is long gone                hope so, and i also hope the hyundai of the 90s is gone as well - which is part of the problem - a leopard doesn't change its spots that quickly,  at least in the carbuyer's mind - and despite the fact that it amy be true!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4882#msg4882re: may genesis sale figures [backy]        what was nonsense was your statement that:                 the more expensive the car, the better the 'percentages' look                which is not necessarily true - lincolns as my example -cars that can sell for close to 50 large and be bought after 1 year for half of that.	1
	we apparently agree on the whole the dollars lost is what counts  thing - something certainly not 'nonsense!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4883#msg4883re: may genesis sale figures [toye]        long gone?	1
	when i mentioned to my wife that the new genesis seems pretty decent for the money of a es or tl, upon knowing the brand, her reply is simple, 'don't you buy us a hyundai!'	1
	same perception is still pretty much among my friend circles.	1
	now this has nothing to do how good a car the genesis is, i knew korean can make cheap quality products, kuhmo is one example.	1
	overall hyundai resales values are increasing because people's perception of hyundai is changing.	1
	the hyundai of the 80's is long gone.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4884#msg4884re: may genesis sale figures [ctl]         same perception is still pretty much among my friend circles                if  i would go out and buy my teenager his/her first car and i had a choice between a 5 year old honda (or toyota) or a 3 year old hyundai at the same price - one purchase is going to meet with some understanding        nods, the other with a plane ticket to the funny farm.	1
	never said it was right or even fair, but perhaps an unfortunate truth.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4885#msg4885re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        captain...can't argue with that...more up front does equal more later on, however...the point of my statment is that if 2 cars of different makes (one premium and one not so premium) sell for whatever price they sell (let's say the premium sedan sells for $15k more than the non-premium sedan, and the value lost over, say...3 years is equal to 20%.	1
	let's say the premium sedan was $45k...-20%...that's $36,000, right?	1
	i said the non-premium was $15k less, right, so $30k - 20% is $24,000, right?	1
	well, the premium sedan is still worth more in terms of money, but the difference in their original price and the price they are worth later is the same (20%).	1
	so in actuality, the percentage of loss is the same, but...the $45k car lost $9k and the $30k car lost $6k...so which was the greater loss if they both took a 20% hit?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4886#msg4886re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        unless my circle of friends plan on ponying up the money to pay for my child's first car, i could care less what they might think about why my child is rolling down the street in.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4890#msg4890re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        and the folks that are still resistant to the idea of driving a hyundai are the very ones that haven't even taken themselves to go look at one in person.	1
	they see them on the streets and know they look good and would be a car they could see themselves in, but because it's a hyundai...won't bother to go find out that there's so much more behind the sheet metal.	1
	their are afraid that they would be forced to change their mentality in regards to hyundai products.	1
	hey...i once laughed at the disposable excels (even owned one as a necessity).	1
	however, the '02 sonata made me a believer considering it cost me $6k less than a comparably equipped camry at the time.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4891#msg4891re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]        if you are truly keeping a car 'until the wheels fall off' then you are in the minority - the 'normal' time spent with a first only is slightly less than 4 years - and this statisitic is decreasing primarily because of all the leases.	1
	that said, it does not take a rocket scientist to know that if you are going to do that then the best car from an operational cost point of view (operating and repair costs equal) will always be the cheapest one to buy inititally.	1
	it's when your like most other folks and don't do that - this is when that might not always be true.	1
	car dealers btw are quite good psychologists, they will know when a particular buyer is sensitive to what they might allow for trade-oin value and therefore will inflate that number at the expense of what they might otherwise have done with purchase price.	1
	in your case, you got a good deal because you think you did (isn't that all that really matters), i would have no idea - too many variables.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4892#msg4892re: may genesis sale figures [ctl]        obviously your wife haven't sat in a genesis or a late model hyundai.	1
	most of my circle of friends our stunned by the quality of the genesis and are now open to possibly of purchasing a hyundai as their next purchase.	1
	they too were stuck in the 80's mentality but now has changed their perception of hyundai.	1
	it's that kind of open thinking that will carry hyundai to new heights.	1
	will hyundai ever be associated with bmw, mb or lexus?	1
	probaly not,  but it will be on par with toyota, and honda.	1
	in order for hyundi to compete in the luxury they will need to put genesis as sub brand such as lexus (toyota) and infinitity(nissan).	1
	again toyota, honda and datsun were a inferior brand in the 70's and early 80's and look what happen.       	1

	hyundai kicked things into high gear for the 2006 model year vehicles, and haven't slowed 1 bit.	1
	they put their cars on the fast track to beat toyota and honda at their own game.	1
	they're right on schedule.	1
	at the current rate, i think their quality and value will surpass their competition by a considerable margin in 2-3 years, and sales in 6-8 years.	1
	it will happen the same way some of the korean electronics manufacturers surpassed their japanese counterparts.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4897#msg4897genesis        i think hyundai has a plan for the name genesis.	1

	in canada i have seen a few genesis models at the dealer lot with only the genesis name on the car, no hyundai name, or badge to be seen anywhere inside or outside the car.	1
	instead it has a logo similar to a bentley.	1
	i think in the next few years hyundai will start opening genesis dealerships (lexus, infiniti, acura, genesis).	1
	it is the luxury brand of the future.	1
	i also wanted a genesis, but ironically this korean car was too expensive for my budget.	1
	so i ended up getting a 2009 mazda6.	1
	already regret that decision.	1
	after just one year, the mazda engine already sounds like a diesel when idling.	1
	japanese cars are not what they used to be.	1
	just look at the toyota forums with the troubles they had with their six speed transmissions, the sludge problems in the engines.	1
	look at the honda forums, transmission problems abound.	1
	all my friends who ended up buying hondas or toyotas back in 1999 already got rid of their cars.	1
	a toyota had to change both engine and transmission at 30k, acura tl had changed his transmission 3 times by 90k (that is kilometeres not miles).	1
	when in fact my 1999 daewoo leganza is still running like new (original engine and transmission).	1
	in fact its engine still sounds better after 10 years than my 2009 mazda6.	1
	korean cars all the way baby.	1
	maybe in a couple of years i can trade in my mazda6 with a hyundai sonata.	1

	now maybe im wrong but thats the way i think,kinda like when ppl get married and sign a pre-nuptial agreement,to me its a blueprint to failure.yeah, yeah i know ya gotta protect yourself.....blah,blah.i buy a car cause i like it and i feel its worth the price they are asking for it.i got my 2002 sonata for $14,000.00 3grand cheaper than someone paid for the same car (got info from this forum) so what!	1
	thats what it cost to do business at the time and as long as we both were happy we got a good deal imo.	1
	im more interested in the quality issues and users take on their new genesis than i am crunching numbers..........of course this is just my opinion and.......i could be wrong as you see it.bottom line 4me is i got a good deal on my genesis and i love driving it,although its not perfect it is a really nice car and when and if i sell it i will then find out what the cars value is at that moment in the town i live.in my mind anything i get for a 'used' car after i have driven it for a number of years is all gravy or 'free money' cause the way i see it is it cost what it cost to enjoy for x number of years.so tell us what you think.	1

	the postives outweigh the negatives for sure.	1
	i really do like the car, but, it is not without flaws.	1
	first the positives...                                1:  its simply the quietest car i have ever driven.	1
	2:  very comfortable, supportive seating                3:  great features, lexicon mid grade system very nice (although needed some tuning to sound its best)  every car should have auto windshield wipers                4: great fit and finish                5: mpg hovering around 19.5 - 20.5 (all city or gridlock hwy)                6: handles very well for a big car                                the bad:                                1: no doubt the ride can get 'unsettled' at times                                2: steering needs to be damped better, bumps in the road transmit too much through the wheel.	1
	3: power... this car simply doesn't feel like 290 hp to me.	1
	hyundai should go get a toyota 2gr (3.5) and see what i am talking about.	1
	my '06 avalon never felt like it needed more power depsite having 22 less hp than the genesis.	1
	also, the toyota motor was much more willing to rev and had more low end grunt.	1
	maybe it will get better once really broken in??	1
	4:                 petty i admit                , but the water dripping into the trunk when you open it with water on it is annoying.	1
	maybe i am being a touch too critical with some things.	1
	overall, the gen is a great value and an overall good car.	1
	i am just getting used to a sportier tuned ride as i have driven soft riding toyotas (solara, and 2 avalons) for ten years.	1
	only time will tell which i like better.	1
	as of right now, i have to say i miss my '06 avalon.	1
	i am hoping that will change as i get used to the genesis.       	1

	of years owned, entirely believeable numbers in your case - and in his.	1
	has nothing to do with maintanence or other operational costs,  in his example.	1
	it should however be noted that how much anybody gets  for something on trade will often have little to do with what that something is actually worth.	1
	sell it (or buy it) for cash (or privately) then you know a 'true' value.	1
	as i said earlier, if a dealer knows that a perspective buyer is sensitive about the value of his car he will work the numbers in such a way that trade-in values are high and vice versa if its is new car 'discount' that floats a buyer's boat.	1
	honda doesn't tend to discount heavily, so they therefore can allow what appears to be a generous amount on that used accord - hyundai does tend to discount heavily and therefore has less room for that sonata trade-in.	1
	besides which, that used accord will command a lot more attention (and likely profit) on the used car lot than that sonata, at any price - and the dealer knows it.	1
	hondas, especially, are in a completely different league than about anybody else when it comes to residual values, and likely will remain so as long as that brand continues to police the prices that its products are sold for and further, keeps its products away from the rental fleets.       	1

	i guess then toyota must therefore be the 'best' simply because they are now #1 ?	1
	a debatable position,  at best.	1
	samsung, just like hyundai, has acquired its market share much in a typically korean fashion, selling arguably 'comparable' products cheaper and was initially met with a bunch of consumer resistance - that 'korean' name thing again.	1
	lg has done a good job 'hiding' its origins perhaps because of its decidedly 'anglo' sounding name, while samsung has earned its acceptability as you note- something that hyundai (who also is in the electronics business btw) can only aspire to  right now.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4929#msg4929re: may genesis sale figures [toye]        yeah, right.	1
	i heard all this about the azera and went and bought one much to my dismay.	1
	in fact, if it had not been for the large number of questionable reviews about the genesis sedan, i would be in one right now.	1
	there are far too many people complaining about the genesis suspension for it not to be an issue - both consumers and professionals.	1
	if not an issue, why else did they revise it already and plan for another revision on the 2010 model?	1
	this comes directly from hma.	1
	hopefully they will get it right and it will be a great car.	1
	it is not a lexus, infiniti or acura - maybe some day, but not now.	1
	it is a very well equipped car for less money.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4930#msg4930re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        interesting how this debate has devolved into bashing korean products because they are korean.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4936#msg4936re: may genesis sale figures [toye]        unlike you  (i bet) i have spent a significant amount of time (back in the 80s and early 90s) ) working at hyundai's facility in south korea.	1
	hyundai is a conglomerate and makes  about everything in a single (massive) facility literally miles long (ulsan) on the se coast of the country.	1
	the koreans are a remarkable people, and deserve much credit for their ambitions as well as their work ethic.	1
	if only we americans hadn't lost that somewhere over the years , then maybe that genesis, or other fine products, would have been a chevy!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4937#msg4937re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        are you upset that america isn't making or up to making the products that are competive in todays market place.	1
	i'm so impressed how huyundai in just a span of 10 years has come in making one the nicest automobiles in production today.	1
	yes i wish the detroit could have done the same thing instead of hording the profits in good times and spending on themselves (investors) why they didn't invest into their (our) future (product development) perhaps now we will learn our lesson!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4938#msg4938re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        i've been out of pocket the last few weeks and just getting caught up here.	1
	it's amazing to me that a few certain individuals continue to devote their lives to trashing the genesis and all things korean.	1
	i've owned my 4.6 tech since february and admit the suspension could be a bit better, but for the money i paid there just isn't another car on the market like it.	1
	other than that minor complaint, there simply isn't anything else i can complain about.	1
	we're talking about a 375hp, rear wheel v8 that averages over 25mpg on the highway!!!	1
	show me another car this classy, at this price, that can boast that.	1
	congrats to all of us who took the plunge!!	1
	!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4939#msg4939re: may genesis sale figures [toye]         are you upset that america isn't making or up to making the products that are competive in todays market                yes - and one look at the disaster area detroit has become will tell you why.	1
	no real reason for it either - other than greed.	1
	can you imagine what we all would be saying if the genesis was instead some sort of luxo 'impala' - or crown vic?	1
	they would be selling at least 10k vehicles a month and folks would be on waiting lists....       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4940#msg4940re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]         so now largest = best?	1
	no it doesn't.	1
	however, samsung was practically unknown 15 years ago, and is now the biggest.	1
	many of their products are widely acknowledged to be the best in their category.	1
	hyundai and other korean manufacturers know the formula to defeat japan, and they will do so.	1
	the usa also knows the formula, but we let politics get in our way.	1
	someone will come along and knock hyundai off, then they will get knocked off.	1
	it's called competition, and it's good.	1
	don't bemoan the fact that a $40k hyundai is as good as a $60k japanese or german car.	1
	take advantage of it!	1
	it's only temporary.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4941#msg4941getting out of the patriotic arguments here...        i had an interesting comparison today at my dealership.	1
	i have been cross shopped against 7's, s's, ls's etc.	1
	today i had a first comparison to the jaguar xj long wheel base.	1
	this lady had a driver, and they spent the most time testing out the space and comfort in the back.	1
	not much to this post but i thought i make a comment to illustrate the kind of comparison shopping the genesis gets at least in my store in manhattan.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4942#msg4942re: getting out of the patriotic arguments here... [dudest]        another example the genesis is attracting and being compared to luxury vehicles and not middle class family sedans       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4943#msg4943re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        honda does a much better job than either hyundai or toyota on fleet sales, but... the last three rentals i've had - in charlotte, orlando, and la were honda accord ex models.	1
	so, they're out there, but just in fewer numbers.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4944#msg4944re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]         'i don't know where you got your figures from, but i really don't know where you figure it cost me $3000 to own my car.'	1
	you paid $17k and sold it for $5k.	1
	that equals $12k.	1
	divided by the 4 years you owned it equals $3000 per year.	1
	'your accord was 9 years old with 102k miles on it.	1
	my sonata was 4 years old with 105k miles on it...for me to get $5k for it was phenomenal.'	1
	what's phenomenal is that a 9 year-old accord was worth almost as much as your 4 year-old sonata!	1
	how much would a 9 year-old sonata fetch?	1
	maybe $1200?	1
	how is that phenomenal?	1
	of course, to get back on topic, i do think the genesis will change things for hyundai.	1
	the sonata, azera, et al are a completely different breed, and while they're nice enough cars, they have no real exceptional qualities except price.	1
	the genesis, on the other hand, is a grand slam for hyundai, and stands alone as the one car from korea that can play with the luxury marques on a level field.	1
	i predict the genesis will be the turning point for hyundai as a brand in the us.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4945#msg4945re: may genesis sale figures [bobad]         don't bemoan the fact that a $40k hyundai is as good as a $60k japanese or german car.	1
	never read any test, review, expert opinion,  or anything else that would dare make this contention.	1
	has it been highly rated for what it is relative to what it costs - certainly, (as it should) but there remains quite a few differences primarily in the refinement areas.	1
	maybe you just have a  different set of standards.	1

	i have tested one and found it at least equal to a mercedes in every way.i have also read every review i could find.nothing there that would indicate any inferiority to the so called elite brands.	1
	is it possible that people who are wealthy hate the idea that a middle class person could afford a luxury sedan?	1
	i'm sure that one could buy a genesis for $30,000.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4948#msg4948re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]         maybe you just have a different set of standards.	1
	i guess this professional reviewer as low standards too.	1
	sheesh!	1
	cars.about.com                allow me to start with a disclaimer: i am not lying.	1
	i am only pointing that out because i expect a large number of readers not to believe me when i talk about how good the hyundai genesis is.	1
	there are a lot of people who are convinced that hyundai simply cannot build a decent car.	1
	not that i blame them; twenty years ago hyundai was peddling the excel, a car that cost $45 to build and was made out of compressed squirrel turds.	1
	who in their right mind would believe that hyundai could come so far, so fast?	1
	for those who are inclined to believe me, i'll give you the short version: the genesis sedan is a lexus.	1
	it drives like a lexus.	1
	it coddles you like a lexus.	1
	it even smells like a lexus.	1
	it's a $33,000 lexus, unless you go for the v8 model, in which case it's a $38,000 lexus with the engine from a $60,000 mercedes.	1
	actually let me post some more cause i love reading what professionals have to say compared to what amateurs have to say including myself!	1
	thecarconnection.com                reviewers were at odds about assembly quality and the fine details of the 2009 hyundai genesis.	1
	fit and finish, stitching, touch, materials, and integration are all very good, raved autoblog, keeping in mind the under-$40,000 price tag for the v-8.	1
	conclusion                the plush 2009 hyundai genesis is one of the roomiest and quietest large sedans, with interior trim that rivals top luxury brands.	1
	i love my genesis...                                (since i've been quoting alot of what professionals have to say...i'll add here what i hate...yes hate about my genesis.	1
	my pet peeves on this car:                the chromed finish vent in the front are blinding when the sun hits it!	1
	the navigation has very little detail when you zoom out.	1
	it removes detail way to early.	1
	the esc does not completely turn off.	1
	the dunlop tires suck!	1
	you see i admit that the genesis is not perfect...but...to me it is pretty dam close!	1
	compared to everything else i tried (everything else was more expensive), it's the best one of the bunch!	1
	no way the other cars costing soo much more were justifiable to pay the difference...no way!!!	1
	of course this is just my opinion...a regular joe's opinion!	1
	regards,       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4949#msg4949are most people wrong?	1
	its interesting to me that i read things where ppl say the genesis is a nice car but.	1
	fact: genesis is car of year..........so is this wrong?	1
	i understand different ppl like different things in a car or any other product.its a genesis and not any other car its being compared with,it looks different and is different but imo its a good enough car to be in the class that its in.the reason we have such a great country is because ppl can have different opinions and make different choices and if ya got the money ya can buy what you like.thats why i bought my 2009 genesis and am very happy with it.	1
	yeah,yeah its not the best car,just a really good car imo and many others.yes price did come into play when i made my choice,why,because why spend 50% more for a car when the genesis will serve my needs and iam happy with the quality.aah one other thing.......the money i saved buying this car will be spent on a vacation,and i wont stay in the $500 a nite room but the $200 a nite room and enjoy the same quality and service.	1

	at that price there is no way it could complete in the luxury or near luxury market.	1
	it would be way too cheap!	1
	or it could redefine what it takes to be included in those market niches and actually force other manufacturers to stand up and take notice that their markets may be in the process of being (slightly?)	1

	absolutely.	1
	is the difference worth a $20,000 premium?	1
	maybe, maybe not.	1
	i think there are three basic consumers here.	1
	some who find the genesis to be just as good as a european car in every way that matters to them.	1
	for them, slam dunk - save your money and buy the hyundai.	1
	for others, the superior build quality, styling, road manners, dealer experience, etc.	1
	of the european car make the genesis unacceptable.	1
	most people, i suspect, are somewhere in the middle.	1
	they perceive the difference between the two, but ultimately must make a value call to decide if the european experience is worth the premium.	1

	how much would a 9 year-old sonata fetch?	1
	maybe $1200?	1
	how is that phenomenal?	1
	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....the real question is, how much would you have gotten if your accord was 4 years old with that same 102k miles???	1
	you see...the age of the car isn't the major factor here, mileage is.	1
	at 102k over 9 years...that's just over 11k miles/year.	1
	my sonata endured just over 50k miles/year...in the auto industry, 11k miles/year is much more attractive than 50k miles/year.	1
	so imagine how much more i probably would have gotten if my car had only 44k miles on it after 4 years!!!	1
	of course, to get back on topic, i do think the genesis will change things for hyundai.	1
	the sonata, azera, et al are a completely different breed, and while they're nice enough cars, they have no real exceptional qualities except price.	1
	the genesis, on the other hand, is a grand slam for hyundai, and stands alone as the one car from korea that can play with the luxury marques on a level field.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4958#msg4958re: may genesis sale figures [bobad]        mine are also, that's why i got the bmw.	1
	it was at the dealers a total of 6 times in 3+ years.	1
	total out of pocket: $350 for the alarm.	1
	while i know people who have problems with bmws, i also know people who  have problems with hyundais.	1
	buying a car is a crap shoot and all the jd powers stars in the world does not guarantee you a pleasant ownership existence.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4959#msg4959re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]        good point about mileage vs. age, but i don't think it significantly changes the logic.	1
	i played around with kbb.com and ran some numbers.	1
	all figures are 'trade-in value' in 'good' condition.	1
	2005 accord lx (4 cyl) 100,000 miles - $6000                2000 accord lx 100,000 miles - $3300                                2005 sonata gls (v6) 100,000 miles - $3500                2000 sonata gls 100,000 miles - $1650                                as you can see, age plays a huge role in resale value.	1
	also, any way you slice it, an accord is worth almost twice as much as a comparable sonata.	1
	but again, the point of all this is to say the sonata's and santa fe's of old are not the same cars that hyundai is currently building.	1
	i think the genesis could usher in a new generation of hyundai cars where msrp's and residual values will increase as buyer confidence in the marques quality, prestige, reliability, and resale values increase.	1
	the big question is, can hyundai become another honda/acura, or will they become more like volvo or jaguar (fine cars that plummet in value after a few years)?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4960#msg4960re: may genesis sale figures [fedlawman]        i am a little surprised that the values are that close considering the original 'street price' of the accord would have been several thousand more than the sonata.	1
	depreciation is figured off the msrp and when new, the accord sells close to msrp and the sonata sells thousands less than msrp.	1
	for example, fitzmall has the sonata gls msrp of $21,320.	1
	and selling price of $14,999.	1
	they do not sell hondas but their cheapest camry has an msrp of $21,395.	1
	and a selling price of $18,319.	1
	i think you would be hard pressed to buy a new accord lx for that price anywhere.                        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4961#msg4961re: may genesis sale figures [houdini1]        it's true hyundai's cost less upfront thanks to frequent factory incentives.	1
	so you can save money either on the front end (hyundai purchase)) or the back end (honda resale value).	1
	and of course, as has already been mentioned, the longer you keep a car, the less important resale value becomes.	1
	so after several years of ownership, the total cost of ownership for the hyundai will meet orbeat a comparable honda.	1
	in the end, all it shows is that, basically, a honda costs more upfront to purchase, but really doesn't cost any more to own than a 'less expensive' hyundai - and which car would you rather own for the same cost?	1
	which will be the better car when it's 10 years old?	1
	this last question was easy to answer 5 years ago - honda all the way.	1
	today, with the genesis and others on the horizon, this is where hyundai can make big strides and improve their position in the market.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4962#msg4962re: may genesis sale figures [fedlawman]        i agree with you on this.	1
	at this point i would still take the honda.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4963#msg4963re: may genesis sale figures [fedlawman]        fedlawman                your views are perhaps not as bias has they have appeared to be.	1
	i'm  begining to understand  where you are coming from.	1
	in my opinion no other auto company is making stides that hyundai has in the past decade.	1
	they have come a long way and hyundai is positioning itself for even bigger rewards.	1
	can anyone ever imagined paying today for a $40k yugo (hyundai was only one step above it back in the 80's)                                my have times changed.       	1

	vw tried to sell the phaeton here and failed miserably, but the new beetle is still a runaway hit.	1
	and mini has almost single-handedly kept the sales numbers for bmw in the black.	1
	the genesis a good start, but hyundai has a ways to go.	1
	they need to keep the lineup focused and establish a strong foundation/identity below the genesis (compact, family, crossover/wagon) by exceeding expectations and dominating the rankings they choose to focus on (quality, excitement, economy, etc.).	1
	if they do this over the next few years, then they can move away from their current 'less expensive and almost as nice as a japanese car' identity (the genesis coupe is an example of this mistake) and truly become a force in na.       	1

	the genesis is in reality the poor man's version of the mercedez e class (literally) much like brandon roy is a poor man's version of say kobe bryant if anyone follows basketball.	1
	whats so great about the genesis in my opinion is that for the price consumers can't lose(even it were 5k less than the gs).	1
	some who are greedier and richer may want more (mercedez).	1
	you can definitely compare the genesis to the mercedez in regards to the basic requirements of what embodies a luxury large sedan but no doubt when needing to checkmark some extras the merdecez gets the checkmarks and genesis doesn't.	1
	however the equus does put those checkmarks into place and the only thing holding it back from being as good as a mercedez e class has to do with the emblem factor                                    hyundai imo is the most dangerous and ambitious car company the industry hasn't seen in a while since toyota took the industry in a storm 10 years ago        	1

	it doesn't make sense.	1

	i own a genesis and its a fine automobile.	1
	it is not a mercedes, bmw, lexus, or infiniti.	1

	against all those it holds up really well.	1
	the only vehicle of the group that may better the genesis in v6 form is the avalon.	1
	i guess what i am getting to is instead of saying the genesis is                 almost                as good as 50-60k+ cars, say its at the 'top of the class' for upscale large sedans (which is what it is!)	1

	those who drove those early japanese vehicles know what i mean - they were not without their problems, mechanically or structurally.	1
	now, two generations later, some are debating the south korean vehicles attributes.	1
	having owned many japanese and european vehicles since 1964, i can state from experience that with the exception of resale value, the south korean vehicles are excellent products.	1
	after 4 years of ownership, my hyundai has had zero warranty claims, and was perfect from the factory.	1
	the same can't be said for the mb, porsche, saab, volvo, honda, mazda, nissan, or toyota that i, or a member of my family, has owned.	1
	for those who argue resale, it's a valid point, but this is changing along with the market perception, and reality, of hyundai.	1
	and, for those who keep a vehicle for 10 to 15 years, that factor becomes less relevant.       	1

	steering feel?	1
	driveline refinement?	1
	two automobiles may have the same brake pads/rotors, the same tires, same shock tuning, etc.	1
	and yet be completely different driving machines.	1
	bmw and mercedes have mastered the art of building a car that absorbs road imperfections, corners flat, and has outstanding steering response, without numbness or float.	1
	they coddle, isolate, and involve the driver all at the same time.	1

	wow, from the way the reviewer was talking, it's like he and i drove 2 different cars.	1
	maybe we did?	1
	as i've said before, i was impressed with the genesis when i drove one a couple of months ago.	1
	but perhaps my experience with a low optioned v6 is different than a loaded v8, because my experience driving the v6 didn't match the reviewers impressions in the video.	1
	i found the dynamics (driving feel, chassis refinement, steering response, etc.)	1
	to be nice, but not mercedes or bmw nice.	1
	i thought it felt more like a very good honda accord or toyota camry, which is not a dig on the genesis.	1
	the accord has nice driving dynamics (a fantastic driveline with a bit too much cabin noise/harshness), and the camry is just the opposite (smooth and quiet, with numb and soft dynamics).	1
	the v6 genesis, in my mind, blends the best qualities of both, with richer appointments and better styling.	1
	regarding the genesis vs. the europeans, i found the differences to be significant.	1
	the genesis felt good, but the europeans are sublime.	1
	they absolutely go down the road with a grace, confidence, and feel that the hyundai can't match.	1
	perhaps the v8, being heavier and having different suspension settings, tires, steering, etc.	1
	(i don't know what specific differences there are) rides and drives better than the v6?	1
	i can't say - i've never driven the v8.	1
	but, that's my opinion and i'm sticking to it.       	1

	i am not putting the v6 down in any way shape or form...what i am saying is that there's a significant difference with the v8.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4978#msg4978re: lol [bobad]        we'll just have to disagree on that.	1
	i know and understand refinement.	1
	the last degree of refinement just doesn't do that much for me.	1
	when you spend north of $30k on a car, you should expect a nice car that drives very well.	1
	by all accounts, that's what you get in a genesis.	1
	i have to admit that some euro cars have more refined driving habits than the new genesis.they should, they are in an entirely different price class, and have been refined over many years to just 1 year for the genesis.	1
	spending more gets rapidly diminishing returns.	1
	you can spend $10-$20k more and have to wear your thinnest underwear and cock your ears to feel and hear the difference.	1
	that tiny difference may be worth a few bucks to me, but certainly not $10-$20k.	1
	the real question is,,,                 is the genesis refined enough                .	1
	the answer for me is a resounding yes.	1
	i think the genesis hits a sweet spot, where in order to get a little bit better car, you have to spend a lot more.	1
	some are willing to spend a lot for a little more, but not me.	1
	good!	1
	it would be boring seeing nothing but genesisizzz on the road.        	1

	excellently put.	1
	it is enough.	1
	and for some new owners the refinement/luxury level might be overwhelming since they were former accord/camry and other fwd mid size cars owners.	1
	and it is definitely refined enough for its class.	1
	i have stopped by my dealer to get oil changes and i do see quite a few bmw and lexus used cars on the lot(meaning most likely those were traded in for the genesis).	1
	hyundai probably doesn't care to resale any of them and would keep them on display as a trophy to examplify their accomplishments        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4980#msg4980re: refinement up to the task [choe13]        yes, well put.	1
	i agree completely.	1
	but, diminishing returns for your new car dollar don't necessarily begin at the genesis.	1
	is a mercedes e-class worth $19,000 more than the genesis?	1
	for some, the answer is no.	1
	but for others, the genesis isn't worth $12,000 more than the honda accord or toyota camry.	1
	it's a personal decision, but the point remains - you don't get something for nothing with cars.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4981#msg4981re: may genesis sale figures [fedlawman]        appears we may agree on something.	1
	i think hyundai needs to spend more time working out the bugs on each                 new                car before developing an even newer car.	1
	they also need to have strong marketing plans for                 new                models for 3 years or more.	1
	it seems that they bring out a new model, azera, vera cruz, genesis sedan, genesis coupe, push them for a year or so and then move on to something else.	1
	azera could have been a fantastic product if refined a little and really marketed hard.	1
	same for vera cruz.	1
	will same thing happen to genesis?	1
	while sales are good now, will they continue to be?	1
	same scenario applies to newer versions of their other models.       	1

	for some, the answer is no.	1
	but for others, the genesis isn't worth $12,000 more than the honda accord or toyota camry.	1
	stepping up in price from genesis to an e-class, one doesn't get a lot of                 tangible                amenities for their $19k .	1
	they get a lot more stepping up $10k from an accord/camry to genesis.	1
	just the cabin room, the quiet, and he rwd is substantial without mentioning the rest.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4985#msg4985re: refinement up to the task [bobad]        the differences between the e350, genesis, and accord/camry are tangible.	1
	it's the perceived value of those differences that is highly subjective.	1
	some might place a high value on the e350's superior telematics, more robust active/passive safety features, and 7-speed transmission.	1
	others might think mercedes styling, brand cachet, and dealership experience (before and after sale) add value to the equation.	1
	others don't care about seat belt pre-tensioners for rear seat occupants, automatic collision notification system, or retractable heated headlight washers.	1
	and likewise, some buyers don't about fwd or rwd (can 95% of buyers in this segment even tell the difference?).	1
	cabin room, noise, etc.	1
	are important considerations, but again, many won't think that an extra inch of rear legroom or 2 db of sound deadening is worth the premium.	1
	many buyers think that getting the v6 and leather seats is a waste and would rather save money with a 4 cyl camry.	1
	again, it's a personal value call that will vary with each individual.	1
	for you, the genesis fits a perfect middle-ground where the value matches the content.	1
	this is what makes the genesis such a great car for hyundai.	1
	it stands alone in this middle-ground - nobody else has a car to compete directly with it.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4990#msg4990thoughts and opinions        i think i am lost on this forum board.	1
	i feel like there are some very 'pro-genesis' contributors that are either owners, owners-to-be or dreamers, and those that are very 'anti-genesis' who are either owners or not.	1
	it seems like there are discussions about the suspension and if it matches the taste of the poster, the pedigree and if it matches the expectations of the poster, and some subset of posts discussing actual vehicle features.	1
	i think the 'pro/anti' thing is kind of silly.	1
	its a car.	1
	it either meets your needs/desires/expectations or it doesn't.	1
	if it meets your criteria, it seems like a strong purchase.	1
	if it doesn't for whatever reason that might be, i think there are plenty of other opportunities in that price range.	1
	my opinion is its a very compelling vehicle.	1
	i was impressed with the time i spent with the v6 and the v8 and how some of the features were implemented.	1
	i thought the hd radio was one of the slickest i've seen, although i think the ipod integration is still behind benchmark leaders (behind ford, ahead of honda).	1
	i liked the driving dynamics and found the ride quality acceptable.	1
	i felt a sense of quality in the interior.	1
	i don't think its a car for me, as it doesn't match what i am looking for in a vehicle, but that isn't a fault of the genesis.	1
	if i was a little bit older and not as much of a driving enthusiast, it would be high on my list.	1
	i would still find it preferable to vehicles like the lexus es and mercedes c-class but behind the infinit g35/7 and bmw 3-series.	1
	probably not a bad place to be, especially for the first time out.       	1

	an engineer is however an expert in quality of design of an automobile and can acurately predict its drivability.'	1
	no, my point is that cars possess many subjective qualities that cannot be measured by test equipment.	1
	i could have used any number of examples...                                can a chemist test the composition of a $600 bottle of balvenie 30 year scotch and make an objective determination that it tastes better than a $60 bottle of glenlivet 21?	1
	can a whiskey aficionado justify purchasing such an expensive bottle of scotch?	1
	can an audio engineer feed test tones into a pair of $25,000 revel studio2 speakers and objectively determine that they sound better than a $1500 pair of infinity classia speakers?	1
	can an audio enthusiast justify spending that much money on a pair of stereo speakers?	1
	glenlivet is fine single malt scotch.	1
	the infinity classia is a terrific sounding speaker.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/4992#msg4992re: may genesis sale figures [fedlawman]         as you can see, age plays a huge role in resale value.	1

	i submit there aren't many.	1
	these groups are so small that they practically all know each other.	1
	you're talking about a few thousand out of 300,000,000 americans.	1
	they march to their own tune, and haggle passionately over trivialities and nuances that the average person has never even considered.	1
	i have a bit of that gene in me, but in my , uh, maturity, i have grown to appreciate practicality.	1
	honda, toyota, hyundai, mazda, and nissan have a bounty of practical cars that are still comfortable, reliable,  and well appointed.	1
	i think the genesis is the current champ in the $30-$40 non-prestige luxury category.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4995#msg4995re: may genesis sale figures [mickeyrom]        no...that is not what i said.	1
	i merely pointed out the differences shown between the two covering the same number of years.	1
	please, don't put words in my mouth.	1
	the starting price of an accord is much more than the starting price of a comparable sonata, especially back in '02!	1
	i paid $17,800 for my '02 sonata gls, comparably equipped camry  accord was running around $23k.	1
	based on that number there, you tell me which car took the greater hit in depreciation.	1
	based on the '05 models used, the accord took a 26% hit while the sonata only took a 19% hit.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4996#msg4996re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]         the accord took a 26% hit while the sonata only took a 19% hit                allmet - you know better than this.	1
	% means nothing, it is of course, all about gross dollars.	1
	if the accord costs let's say $4k more than that sonata to buy (a fair assumption) but was still worth at least that much more                 after any given period of time                then that accord is as cheap (or cheaper) to own than that sonata.	1
	no rocket science here.	1
	this is the basis of the ad campaigns that honda is currently running about the civic and accord.	1
	honda's basis for this claim is tco numbers as published right here on edmund's and i believe is based not on depreciation from msrp but on depreciation from edmund's 'market value' (tmv).	1
	this compensates, at least in part, for the fact that hyundai products tend to sell at higher discounts than honda's.	1
	whether or not you choose to believe them-  and want to contend that the sonata sells cheaper than what edmunds is assumming (or ftm that the accord might also sell cheaper) - is entirely up to you.	1
	the genesis will fare very well (from a cost-to-own point of view) versus those cars that cost substantially more, let's say those bmws/mbs etc.	1
	despite the fact that the bmws, for example, have far better resale retention (on a percentage basis).	1
	the genesis should,  however, cost more to own than some of those similarly priced (and more directly competitive?)	1
	cars like the avalon/tl etc.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4997#msg4997re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]         % means nothing, it is of course, all about gross dollars.	1
	you mean to tell me that % doesn't factor out in gross $$$???	1
	okay, let's make it even simpler...the amount of money lost on the accord is $17k vs. amount lost on the sonata, $14500.	1
	how's that for gross $$$.	1
	if you're crunching numbers, would you want to spend $23k to lose $17k or would you hedge your bet on spending $18k only to lose $14500???	1
	spend less, lose less and keep more in your pocket.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4998#msg4998re: may genesis sale figures [allmet33]         okay, let's make it even simpler...the amount of money lost on the accord is $17k vs. amount lost on the sonata, $14500.	1
	simply ... if this was really what happens,  then the sonata would be cheaper to own - wouldn't it?	1
	based on a 5 year time period (and about 75k miles)  that is not what edmund's/intellichoice/kbb numbers all say, is it?	1
	honda might well be shading the truth, as ad campaigns tend to, but do you really think they are making this stuff up?	1
	it will always be difficult for folks that are prone to buy things because they are cheaper to then understand that cheaper now doesn't                 necessarily                mean cheapest later.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/4999#msg4999re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        captain...i'm not saying that they are making anything up, just wonder how they get their information.	1
	as a previous owner of an '02 sonata, i put very little money into the car.	1
	i mean...regular oil changes, transmission flushes, brake pads, a couple sets of tires, wiper blades, light bulbs were minimal costs to say the least.	1
	the only time i spent any large sum was when i got the timing belt replaced around 90k miles.	1
	that visit was to get the timing belt done, new spark plugs, an alignment  new bra for the front end.	1
	i spent about $1000 at that time.	1
	oh yeah, an my car was paid for after the 2nd year as well.	1
	so seriously...the numbers they come up with...don't add up for me.	1
	the point that's being missed here is that most every car that can be compared to any particular model of a hyundai, will almost always be worth more at trade in simply because it cost more to purchase to begin with.	1
	a bigger deal could be made if an accord cost less than a similarly equipped sonata (brand new) and 5 yr/60k miles down the road it was worth more than that same sonata with the same age/mileage.	1
	however, for giggles...let's say the rate of depreciation between honda, toyota  hyundai were dead even.	1
	if an accord  camry cost  $6k more than the sonata and they all suffer from 26% depreciation...which car fared better??	1
	?       	1

	suppose two people bought new cars in 2004. one paid $19,500 (msrp) for an accord lx and the other paid $17,000 for a sonata gls.	1
	5 years and 60,000 miles later they trade in their cars.	1
	one gets $9,500 for the honda and the other gets $5,000 for the sonata (edmunds used car appraiser).	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5001#msg5001re: hyundai resale?	1
	[fedlawman]        honestly, it depends.	1
	if financing terms are the same, the monthly payment on the sonata would be lower, so technically speaking...the sonata would cost less.	1
	you see...you're talking cost, which means money going out.	1
	so naturally, the one costing less...costs less!	1
	oh...and you must be talking about the accord lx with the 4cyl engine for $19,500, because it certainly wouldn't have gotten you the v-6.	1
	so at that point...you're not even buying the same amount of car.	1
	compare model to model my friend.	1
	i paid $17,800 for a sonata gls w/v-6...an accord with the same options as the sonata was around $6k more.       	1

	[allmet33]        the v6 accord lx came loaded with features not offered on the sonata, not the least of which was a 240hp 3.0l v6 capable of accelerating the accord to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds.	1
	no, in price, features, and performance, the 4 cylinder accord was the closest competitor to the sonata gls v6.	1

	i don't think it would change the math significantly.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5006#msg5006re: hyundai resale?	1
	[fedlawman]        yes, but the whole point is to shop comparable cars, so that means v-6 vs. v-6 (even if there's a difference in power)...which, drives the price of that precious accord up.	1
	msrp on an accord lx (before adding anything) was $25k.	1
	are you talking 2002 or 2004?	1
	2002 honda 3.0 was producing only 200 hp, it wasn't until nissan dropped the altima that honda jumped in with the 240 hp 3.0...no?	1
	you're starting to sound like those ad folks that will tell you that a certain car  (car a) gets better gas mileage than similar cars (cars b  c)of other makes.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5008#msg5008re: hyundai resale?	1
	[fedlawman]        looking at this again, i like it even more.	1
	based on your info...starting out, the accord is $2,500 more than the sonata and yet after it's all said and done, the difference between the two spent is $1500.	1
	considering we're comparing a hyundai with a honda and the fact that honda's been in the game since the 60's and has a 20 year head start on hyundai...that weighs heavily in hyundai's favor.        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5010#msg5010re: hyundai resale?	1
	[allmet33]        yeah, i hear what you're saying, but you know you can never find 2 cars that exactly match.	1
	the i4 accord and v6 sonata have very similar displacement, power, and performance.	1
	the fact that hyundai gets 4 cylinder power out of a 6 cylinder engine was a selling point for them, i guess?	1
	the 4 cylinder accord lx outsells all other trim levels by far.	1
	it is the ubiquitous honda accord - much like the sonata in gls trim.	1
	closest in price, performance, and features - the two cars that would most likely be cross-shopped by a real world consumer.	1
	in my humble opinion...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5011#msg5011re: hyundai resale?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5012#msg5012re: hyundai resale?	1
	[fedlawman]        you're right it is hard to find two cars that match up exactly.	1
	it wasn't until '06 when the sonata became a real player in the game.	1
	i think the '02-05 model year was their way of getting some things right before working the 'performance' aspect.	1
	look at how long it took for toyota to jump in the horsepower wars.	1
	i think hyundai was following in toyota's footsteps in that regard, but realized to compete...they needed to put their money where their engines were (so to speak).	1
	since then, hyundai engines have been much better.	1
	i can't fault you for the cross-shopping point of view, but when i go looking for a car.	1
	i see how much it costs to get everything almost the same.	1
	like i said before...my sonata gls cost me around $6k less than a comparable camry or accord at that time.	1
	i also didn't feel paying that extra money was worth the horsepower gain i would have gotten from either of the other two.	1
	beyond that, i got every other feature and amenity that the others were offering.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5013#msg5013re: hyundai resale?	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5014#msg5014re: hyundai resale?	1
	[allmet33]        iirc, i believe hyundai was using mitsubishi engines at the time.	1
	it wasn't until recently that they began building their own.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5015#msg5015re: hyundai resale?	1

	nice discussion!	1
	when you guys listed the prices, were they actual selling price, or sticker price?	1
	with honda's small discounts and hyundai's large discounts, that can be a big factor in the resale value.	1
	i got my '06 gls with 234hp v6 for $16600.	1
	if i remember correctly, a comparably equipped accord that year would have cost me over $6k more.	1
	i'm not even sure i would have gotten esc on the accord for the extra $6k.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5016#msg5016re: may genesis sale figures [captain2]        as has been pointed out here many times edmund's uses msrp as the cost new.	1
	on the sonata, no one pays msrp.	1
	it is usually about $4,000.	1
	less than msrp.	1
	this makes the sonata cost much less to own than the accord...but it is a lesser car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5017#msg5017re: hyundai resale?	1
	[bobad]        wow...so the price gap never really closed between '02-'06 between the sonata  the accord.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5018#msg5018re: may genesis sale figures [houdini1]         this makes the sonata cost much less to own than the accord...but it is a lesser car.	1
	i beg to differ.	1
	in the $16-$22k range, the sonata was the best family sedan i could find, by far.	1
	in the same vein, i believe the genesis is the best luxury car in the $30-$40k range.	1
	i think resale value will improve, and it will trickle down to all the later model hyundai's.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5019#msg5019re: may genesis sale figures [houdini1]         pointed out here many times edmund's uses msrp as the cost new                not if i read it right- this from edmund's own explanation of their 'tco':                                 for new vehicles, the total cash price, is the sum of a vehicle's true market value price (another car-buying tool from edmunds), typically equipped options, destination charge, base tax for the state and any applicable luxury/gas-guzzler taxes.	1
	for used vehicles, the total cash price shown is the sum of the vehicle's private party tmv price in 'clean' condition plus typically equipped options, and base tax and fees in your state                edmund's, like others apparewntly uses what they call their tmv (total market value) as a basis for initial costs, this tmv not necessarily being related to msrp at all but rather touted (by edmund's) to be a 'target' price                 after                negotiation.	1
	in any case, while it is obviously true that the hyundai branded product will almost always sell at a higher discount than that honda product,  it also appears that that fact is acounted for in therse 'true-cost-to own' calculations       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5020#msg5020re: hyundai resale?	1

	[allmet33]         yes, but the whole point is to shop comparable cars, so that means v-6 vs. v-6 (even if there's a difference in power)...which, drives the price of that precious accord up.	1
	msrp on an accord lx (before adding anything) was $25k.	1
	wow could i not agree with that less.	1
	when it comes to engines, comparability is about overall performance.	1
	a v-6 that gets generates the same hp and torque as an i-4 is more comparable than a comparing two v-6's with drastically different outputs.	1
	and the smaller engine with better performance is probably a better buy because of the lower weight, yielding better handling and gas mileage to boot!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5023#msg5023re: hyundai resale?	1
	[allmet33]        interesting that other sources such as wikipedia, that font of all knowledge, put the introduction of the alpha in 1993, but either way it's still a long time for hyundai's own engines.	1
	the tau in the genesis sedan is a relatively new design of course, but a great effort for what was only hyundai's 2nd v8, after the omega.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5024#msg5024re: hyundai resale?	1
	[poodog13]        if performance is what you're after, then yes.	1
	if you're interested in a engine that screams and whines when pushed, then yes...go for the smaller engine.	1
	i like the fact that my 2.7 v-6 didn't scream when i cruised the highway at 75-80 mph.	1
	trust me, i had a 4 cyl camry prior to that and the engine made much more noise.	1
	ultimately, it truly depends on what it is you're looking for in a car that will determine just how you will cross shop.	1
	the funniest thing...folks post about how they were interested in the genesis sedan, but then talk about the es 350, g37 and cars that are smaller.	1
	if you were interested in a large sedan to begin with, why are they cross shopping mid-size sedans???	1
	oh...that's right, because that's all they could get in the price range of the genesis.	1

	[allmet33]        allmet - this is fine and a tribute to some fine 'quality control' work on hyundai's part before its products ever leave the factory.	1
	inital quality is however, just that and really has nothing to do with how well its cars hold up over the 3 to 5 year periods we all tend to own them.	1
	in that regard, hyundai doesn't do nearly as well, finishing only midpack in terms of reliability - at least according to the cr 09 auto issue.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5038#msg5038re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        you really can't compare pre 2006 hyundai to the post 2006 models.they have not been around for 5 years yet,so somebody might be lumping them together to get the 5 year reliability on them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5039#msg5039re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        captain...surely even you can appreciate the fact that all things begin somewhere.	1
	in hyundai's case, being ranked high in intial quality is a stepping stone.	1
	honda  toyota hardly whisked to the top of the heap in an expeditious manner.	1
	fact of the matter is...prior to the '06 model year, hyundai wasn't even on the map in regards to initial quality (even though i thought highly of my '02 sonata).	1
	'02 was the year things started shaping up for them with the re-design of the sonata and then in '06, things started getting off the ground with a complete re-do of the sonata and introduction of the azera and all of their other cars getting a re-fresh.	1
	initial quality has shot up, but we'll have to see where things stand in another 4-5 years to see just how these cars are holding up.	1
	so far, my '06 azera...is doing really good.	1
	nothing is falling off, breaking down or broken and i've got just over 71k on it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5040#msg5040genesis 4.6        i drove the v8 today.	1
	i really like the leather dash trim and the overall cabin quality is very nice in this price range.	1
	i must say though, that on the refinement scale, it didn't feel much different from the v6.	1
	yes, it felt a little more planted and composed over the road, and the power is noticeably better, but that extra power (with very little throttle movement) also resulted in more sudden and intrusive activation of the esc when i accelerated in corners.	1
	i also noted the slightly jittery/busy ride over small road imperfections and textures, and was surprised by the amount of tire noise/howling entering the cabin through the chassis - which became noticeable at about 40 mph and unmistakable on the highway.	1
	still though, i'm really picking nits here.	1
	it's probably the one of the nicest cars out there for less than $40,000 and i remain impressed with the level of quality and refinement that it has.	1
	i would never have guessed that it was a hyundai in a blind test.	1
	i guess i'll say that, based on some optimistic comments that i've read about the genesis 4.6 here and elsewhere, i was expecting to be blown away - say a 9 out of 10. what i observed and experienced was more like an 8.5 out of 10. still excellent - i'd buy one in a heartbeat (either the v6 or v8) if i was looking for some value in a large luxury sedan.       	1

	using the 2006 azera as an example, it fared extremely well in jdp and even crs initial rankings but has since retreated substantially.	1
	the  higher volume sonata has put up a respectable (if unremarkable) showing for a number of years now -  even as far back as 2002. interestingly one of the simpliest and cheapest hyundai model does the best, the elantra.       	1

	[captain2]         have read a number of claims on this and other hyundai related sites that will claim that hyundai's quality turnaround acxutally began as far back as 2002. but, what would make 2006 such a magical year from that perspective?	1
	i think that hyundai's surge in quality goes hand in hand with the re-design of their fleet of cars and the addition of the azera to show that they can foray into entry-level luxury.	1
	in '02...they simply refreshed what they had and i think more people took notice because now their vehicles weren't the awkward, ugly ducklings on the road.	1
	they actually started to look like cars folks would want to own (not just out of financial necessity).	1
	'02 is when hyundai introduced shiftronic on the sonata  the xg.	1
	unheard of feature on a cars of the price range they fell in at the time.	1
	the transmission actually proved to be solid, with a greater fewer complaints than on their previous transmissions.	1
	their engines, while not exactly technological wonders...have been better than decent up until the '06 model year when they finally got serious about keeping up with the status quo.	1
	while the re-fresh in '02 made more people take notice, it was the '06 model year that really grabbed folks attention because now hyundai had cars that folks actually wanted to go take a look at and when they did, were completely surprised by what was being offered.	1
	has their turn around been phenomenal...hardly.	1
	however, it has been undeniable.	1
	if hyundai can continue on the path they've been on as of late...they will be mentioned (without chuckles, snorts or guffaws) with honda  toyota without hesitation.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5043#msg5043re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]        a honda or a toyota is bought because it is perceived to be 'better' car than whatever is out there - certainly not because they are the cheapest.	1
	it is when a hyundai product is bought for those kind of reasons are not because it happens to cheapest, has the best 'warranty', and/or  is perceived a 'better' value - that is when we will know that hyundai has made some progress in the quality dept.. something that takes more than a few years of history to prove to a consumer that has a long memory....        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5044#msg5044re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        captain, i can't argue with that logic.	1
	however, as long as hyundai keeps that warranty, it will still be a selling point with them.	1
	heck...the warranty must have something to do with it because there are toyota  honda dealers here in the dc area selling lifetime warranties with their cars.	1
	granted, it's not the manufacturer's warranty, but it's a warranty none the less...and it's putting folks in the seats of those cars.	1
	as far as consumers with long memories...all it would take is one test drive in a hyundai to get them second guessing their previous conceptions of hyundai.	1
	most folks that have a negative view, have never even owned, driven or ridden in one.	1
	that's like saying you can't stand sushi, but you've never tried it.	1
	those that have...can't blame them, but again...if they go take a look-see, they'll be pleasantly surprised.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5045#msg5045re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]        the poster's inference was that circa 2006 hyundai had some sort of revelation in the quality dept something not substantiated by those folks that study these things (cr, for example).	1
	which is why my question.	1
	i am not debating the fact that they have expanded and improved their product line.	1
	heck, if gm or chrysler were fortunate enough to have what hyundai has to sell, then i bet we all could have saved a bunch of our tax dollars!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5046#msg5046re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        the big turnaround was made for the 2006 model year.	1
	hyundai made a powerful statement of commitment, stating they were either going to compete on every level with the top manufacturers, or get out of the car business.	1
	that statement is why i bought the 2006 sonata, and the reason i now trust hyundai.	1
	their mission used to be to sell the most cars at the highest profit possible.	1
	now the mission is to beat their competitors in quality and price in every niche.	1
	i don't even recognize pre-2006 hyundai as being the same company.	1
	not saying that hyundai will stay on track forever.	1
	so far they are on track to aceive their goals, improving their cars every year.	1
	there are going to be at least 7 new models released in the next 3 years.	1
	not bad for a 5 year old car company.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5047#msg5047re: very interesting!!!	1
	[bobad]        well said, however...it's the '02 model year that made me take notice.	1
	i purchased out of necessity since it was the brand that offered me what i was looking for at a price i couldn't walk away from.	1
	however, over the 4 years of ownerhip...that car truly changed my opinion of hyundai as a company.	1
	and to give some perspective, i had owned 3 toyotas prior to my sonata.	1
	i also had something to base it on as i had owned an '87 excel at one point in my life.	1
	night  day...that's the only way to describe it.	1
	as far as not recognizing anything pre-'06...you really must to put it into perspective of just how far  fast they've started turning around.	1
	honda  toyota had a 20 year head start on hyundai and it wasn't until the 80's that they really took off.	1
	hyundai has pretty much followed the same path they laid out.	1
	i think the hardest thing to digest is that hyundai comes from korea.	1
	korea is just not supposed to be producing anything of quailty...it's just not supposed to happen!	1

	[allmet33]         i purchased out of necessity since it was the brand that offered me what i was looking for at a price i couldn't walk away from                this, in a nutshell, is the problem that hyundai has in selling an upscale car like the genesis, and is also a big reason why they are less effected by the crappy economy than about everybody else.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5049#msg5049re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        maybe, but i think it would have been a truly different scenario had hyundai never brought the azera to market.	1
	imagine a company offering the sonata and then jumping to the genesis!!!	1
	the azera showed that they were at least capable and so when it came....those that knew about the azera weren't surprised at all.	1
	the only surprise was how well they executed, especially in comparison to the azera.	1
	oh...in '02, the purchase was out of necessity and it proved to be a solid move.	1
	when i purchased my azera, i did it without hesitation.	1
	sure i took a look at the avalon  maxima just to see what they offered and how much it would cost.	1
	however, there was no hesitation on pulling the trigger on my azera purchase at all.	1
	i made the purchase with pure confidence.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5050#msg5050re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]         imagine a company offering the sonata and then jumping to the genesis!!!	1
	owning an 06 sonata, there is nothing about the car that would make me think twice about buying a genesis.	1
	in fact, quite the opposite.	1
	i admit i am not a car nut, but i have no complaints ablout the car.	1
	if genesis is a larger, more modern, more luxurious sibling of my sonata, i would be more than comfortable owning it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5051#msg5051re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]         had hyundai never brought the azera to market                the azera has proven to be a 'flop' of sorts - it has never sold well, and further don't believe it was ever accepted as hyundai's entry in any sort of upscale market, as ou suggest.	1
	and now  because of the genesis perhaps it has become a lame duck of sorts for those that can get past the name and spend those bigger bucks.	1
	don't expect the azera to be around much longer.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5052#msg5052re: very interesting!!!	1
	[bobad]        bobad...that statement was generally aimed at those that haven't had the pleasure of owning a hyundai as of late.	1
	you and i both share the same thought, but in the rest of the consumers' eyes...had hyundai brought the genesis out after the sonata (with no azera in between), it would have been just like vw going from the passat to the phaeton...and we all know how that fared.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5053#msg5053re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        the azera wasn't really a flop because those that know about it, for the most part...love it.	1
	the problem was that hyundai didn't put any money behind advertising the azera and putting in the public eye like they did the genesis.	1
	like i said...those that own or have driven an azera would understand and not have been surprised with the genesis like most are.	1
	funny...the azera is already slated for a refresh in either 2010-11.  even if it isn't around much past that, it bridged the gap between the sonata and the genesis.	1
	now...the real question will be, can the genesis change perception enough for the american consumer to plop down $60k for the equus/prestige should it come to market??	1
	?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5054#msg5054re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]        folks, i don't know what you all are smokin' but hyundai's quality initiative, in which they changed direction from producing cheap cars to producing quality cars that are a great value, began in 1999, and that is well documented.	1
	in that year, the automotive unit split from the non-automotive units of hyundai and then-chairman chung mong koo set the company on its quality-driven course.	1
	the first fruits of that initiative were arguably the all-new-for-2001 elantra and santa fe, then followed by the '24x7' vehicles (actually 24x8) that began in late 2004 with the all-new tucson and the redesigned sonata (unveiled in the us in early 2005), then the 2006 accent and azera, etc.	1
	fast-forward to 2008-2009 and we see the latest results of this quality push in the genesis sedan and coupe, the veracruz, and the refreshed sonata.	1
	compare those cars to the likes of the 1999 sonata (which was simply tweaked for 2002 my, not redesigned) or the 2001 xg300 and it's like night and day.	1
	we continue to see the results of this focus on quality in latest models such as the elantra touring, a lower-priced car that has won critical acclaim for its build quality, and soon the tucson and sonata replacements that will take hyundai down its new path--not only a focus on quality but on leading-edge styling and fuel efficiency.	1
	anyone who thinks the hyundai of today is even remotely like the hyundai of 1986, or 1996, or even 2006 has a problem facing reality.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5055#msg5055re: very interesting!!!	1
	[backy]        backy...'99 may have seen some behind the scene changes, but it really wasn't until '02 that the hyundai cars started looking like something folks may want to take a look at.	1
	compare any pre-'02 sonata to an '02-05 sonata, while the mechanics hadn't chagned from the '99-'01years, the style did and the car has to be something that draws a buyer in because it looks good, not simply because it's the best deal for your money as captain said earlier.	1
	so, maybe the ball was set in motion in '99, but consumers really didn't start to take notice until the '02 model year.	1
	you're absolutely right, hyundai today is not even close to what it was prior to '06.	1
	it seems like '06 was the year that hyundai re-invented themselves for the better.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5056#msg5056re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]        i guess we will agree to disagree on this.	1
	the 2001 elantra and santa fe debuted in the fall of 2000, and i would say that they were something folks wanted to take a look at.	1
	(not to mention the xg300, which was not a bad looking car for that time, drawing comparisons to the maybach on exterior styling).	1
	in those days, the elantra was hyundai's best seller, and the santa fe garnered strong sales also.	1
	anyway, being good looking and having high quality are not the same thing in my mind.	1
	(i actually thought the '99-'01 sonata was not bad looking.)	1
	and 2006 was significant only in that was the year the gen 4 elantra and gen 2 santa fe debuted (as 2007 models), but i don't think that was nearly as significant as 2004-5 when the 24x7 program kicked off and the tucson, gen 4 sonata, gen 3 accent, and azera first came out.	1
	and of course, the gen 4 elantra and gen 2 santa fe were designed mostly prior to 2006.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5060#msg5060re: very interesting!!!	1
	[allmet33]        i'm guessing the new transmission will take the place of 1 or both of the trannies offered in genesis.	1
	development and production costs are high, so it has to be justified.	1
	i don't believe the fact it's made in house will be a negative to prospective genesis buyers.	1
	hyundai's latest trannies have been solid.	1
	i'm taking an educated guess is all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5061#msg5061re: very interesting!!!	1
	[captain2]        i have to take issue with this arguement as the 'test' being argued is one that essentially can never be tested unless hyundai raises its prices to be on par with honda and toyota.	1
	what you've done is address the discussion of ongoing quality improvements with an arguement whose basis is that as long as hyudai's are considered the best overall value, they must be of inferior quality.	1
	that is a straw man arguement if i've ever seen one.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5062#msg5062re: very interesting!!!	1
	[bobad]        i could definitely see it replacing the aisin tranny since it would be mated to the 3.8 that's in both the genesis and the azera.	1
	i also believe it will find its way into the sonata as well, further boosting it's fuel economy.	1
	you're right about the hyundai-made trannies of late.	1
	no issues with the one that was in my sonata, nor any problems with the one in my azera.       	1

	there, in the middle of the showroom, it was - a shiny silver genesis 4.6, fully loaded.	1
	i looked at the price tag - msrp $42100, alright... and to the right of the window sticker, a small piece of paper titled 'dealer addendum', stating 'market adjustment: $2000', and price total: $44100.	1
	are they kidding???	1
	market adjustment???	1
	oh my god.	1
	just when they must make every effort to move these in current lousy economy.	1
	just when many people are wondering, is it way too much to pay 30k plus for a hyundai.	1
	just when automakers compete who gives more incentives and some cars are almost sold as 'buy 1, get 1 free', these bozos do mark-ups.	1
	ouch.       	1

	[captain2]        on the contrary,since 2006 cr has little negative to say about hyundai or kia mid size sedans.i own a kia optima ex with the 4 cyl engine and after 26,000 mile have no complaints.pre 2006 models had all kinds of mechanical problems,which evidently have been fixed in the post 2006 models.no car is perfect,and you bother to check out the honda civic hybrid section, you will see that the iconic honda brand has as many problems as anyone.	1
	unless you drive a sonata or an optima for an extended period of time,imho your opinion is just that.an opinion with nothing to back it up.	1
	i really think that anyone who basically condems a brand based on their personal prejudices is missing out on some nice 'stuff'.       	1

	ever since the auomobile has been sold and ever since there are occasiona;lly models where demand is high, dealewrs have been doing things like 'market adjustments'.	1
	i wouldn't expect a hyundai shopper to understand such things, but go ask anybody who has shooped a fit or a mini recently.	1
	it is not me that should like things like this, this is good news for existing genesis owners.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5068#msg5068re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]         i wouldn't expect a hyundai shopper to understand such things...                                puh-leeeeeze.        	1

	you're trying to say that someone that shops hyundai just doesn't have a clue?	1
	that's pretty presumptuous of you                                a fit or a mini would see such a mark up because the demand is high for cars that are great on gas.	1
	however, due to the economy, it's quite understandable that someone would be shocked at that kind of mark up on a $40k car.	1
	i'm quite sure that mark up won't last long when the car is still sitting there weeks from now.	1
	i think maybe that dealer is hoping the demand for that car can drive his justification for that type of mark-up.	1
	in the meantime...he'll lose sales.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5070#msg5070re: hyundai dealer from another planet [allmet33]         i'm quite sure that mark up won't last long when the car is still sitting there weeks from now.	1
	but if you have an interest in seeing hyundai improve its name you should hope that the genesis (or any hyundai product) can garner such a premium.	1
	not meant as an insult to anybody either, simply saying that anybody who puts a premium on perceived value (as a typical hyundai buyer does) would not sit still for profiteering like this.	1
	it happens all the time, although i'm not sure that it has ever happened on a hyundai product before!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5071#msg5071re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]        okay...million dollar question:  why does any hyundai vehicle, especially the genesis have to command a premium price in order to improve the hyundai name???	1
	that has to be the dumbest statement i've read in a long, long time.	1
	if hyundai continues to put out vehicles within the niche they've created for themselves and the cars continue to improve, as well as prove to be reliable and dependable down the road, that would better the hyundai name.	1
	yes, the prices will continue to go up as they get better, but the prices will still be lower than those of comparable toyotas, hondas, and nissans.	1
	that's what they are known for and now they'll add quality to that whole thing.	1
	no other hyundai has ever been crowned north american car of the year, so of course you have never seen profiteering happen on a hyundai product before.	1
	any time you get a value based, quality car being compared to the likes of cadillac cts, infinity m's, lexus gs's and such, there's a hype there that no other hyundai vehicle has enjoyed and there are dealers that will try to capitalize off of that.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5072#msg5072re: hyundai dealer from another planet [allmet33]         i wouldn't expect a hyundai shopper to understand such things,                                you really think you have hyundai owners pegged, don't you?	1
	do you think hyundai's are so cheap even a caveman would buy them?	1
	all kidding aside, did you miss out on the giant list i compiled, showing the cars which  genesis owners  traded in on their genesis?	1
	so, even a bmw or mb owner that trades up to a hyundai wouldn't 'understand such things?'	1
	such gross condescension must not go unpunished.	1

	that's what they are known for and now they'll add quality to that whole thing.	1
	i have a simpler explanation.	1
	hyundai's are cheaper because they are built largely by hyundai's own robots in korea and non-union usa shops, not because they're inferior.	1
	genesis shoppers are experiencing 'market adjustments' at dealers because sales are outstripping demand, not because corporate is trying to cash in.	1
	genesis is selling better than expected because it struck a chord with buyers.	1
	everyone that drives the car likes it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5075#msg5075re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]         it happens all the time, although i'm not sure that it has ever happened on a hyundai product before!	1
	be sure.	1
	be very sure.	1
	but here's an idea.. try actually shopping for a hyundai, like many posters here have done, and maybe you can talk with some credibility about what hyundai shoppers do, or know, or understand.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5077#msg5077re: hyundai dealer from another planet [backy]         try actually shopping for a hyundai                i did - and was very disappointed.	1
	greeted by a 20+ know nothing that couldn't talk about the relative attributes of the azera i asked to see and only could talk 'intelligently' about how much cheaper it was vs. the avalon i drove in with.	1
	his associate on the sales floor that afternoon was even worse, and i think he was 'sales manager' for the day.	1
	seriously, all they wanted to talk about was price, thinking, i guess, that everything must be qualified in such a manner.	1
	a big city dealer btw but is hyundai really the training ground for nubie car salespeople, because they sure as hell don't train them.	1
	imo, it is easy to sell something when it is the cheapest, much more difficult when it isn't  - because then, heaven forbid, you might actually have to know something about what you are trying to sell.	1
	how, i ask, can that same caliber of salesperson then sell something called a genesis that really does offer some things worth talking about?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5078#msg5078re: hyundai dealer from another planet [allmet33]         why does any hyundai vehicle, especially the genesis have to command a premium price in order to improve the hyundai name                so i guess you don't think that anything that can be sold for more than what a mfgr is asking for it - says anything about that company's ability to produce such products.	1

	if you're more educated about the car than the salesmen (which is not as unusual as you think unusual) just ignore him.	1
	look at the car, and take it for a drive.	1
	don't get side tracked.	1
	you're not buying a salesman, you're buying a car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5080#msg5080re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]        ok then.	1
	since you have shopped for a hyundai we can group you in with the people incapable of understanding things like adm.                                do some shopping at other dealerships and you'll find incompetence is, unfortunately, not limited to a few salespeople at hyundai.	1
	and you'll find competent, even exceptional sales people exist at hyundai dealers.	1
	we have discussed here how hma has provided special training on the genesis for its dealerships.	1
	just because you didn't talk with one of those people doesn't mean hyundai doesn't train their salespeople or that all of them are incompetent.	1
	if i made my car buying decisions based on whether i had ever talked with an incompetent sales person, i would probably be riding a moped now.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5081#msg5081re: very interesting!!!	1
	[mickeyrom]        here's a fact that opened my eyes on hyundai, and later kia.	1
	one of my business colleague's husband is a toyota service manager at one of the larger toyota dealers in southern fl.	1
	he and and wife drive a hyundai (azera) and a kia (optima) respectively.	1
	previously to moving to florida 14 years ago, he was a master technician at a bmw dealership on long island.	1

	?????	1
	i don't know, i still see none on the road here in south jersey (near philly).	1
	the dealer i bought mine from has plenty to choose from (at least 15-20) and the same ones were there when i picked up my plates two weeks later.	1
	there were no marketing adjustments of any kind and the first offer was $100 over invoice and i easily brought them down to a couple hundred under, plus $1000 rebate, plus 1.44% interest on the lease.	1
	they can't be selling that great!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5083#msg5083re: hyundai dealer from another planet [tjc78]         there were no marketing adjustments of any kind and the first offer was $100 over invoice and i easily brought them down to a couple hundred under, plus $1000 rebate, plus 1.44% interest on the lease.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5084#msg5084re: hyundai dealer from another planet [tjc78]        adm is adm. all they are doing is looking to hook a fish.	1
	if anyone pays the adm more power to the dealer.	1
	the manufacturer doesn't care what the dealer does as they have already financed their allocation.	1
	in my area, i've looked at the weekly ads of the hyundai dealers and noticed none of them advertised the genesis as of last week.	1
	no clue why.	1
	a question for the owners.	1
	are the badging screwed down or held by double stick tape?	1
	i like to debadge all my vehicles and was wondering if that would be possible.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5085#msg5085re: hyundai dealer from another planet [obyone]         i've looked at the weekly ads of the hyundai dealers and noticed none of them advertised the genesis as of last week.	1
	no clue why.	1
	for their advertising dollars they will get much more return running an ad on sonatas, elantras and santa fe's.	1
	are the badging screwed down or held by double stick tape?	1
	i am afraid you are not gonna like this answer... the 'h' on the deck lid is taped on but has 2 studs that stick through.	1
	so you would have to have it filled and painted (not worth it imo) however, you could order a wing logo like many other owners did.	1
	i am not sure about the 'genesis' badge on the lower right of the trunk.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5086#msg5086re: hyundai dealer from another planet [tjc78]         not exactly correct.	1
	the wing badge ordered on e bay comes with points that match the trunk and double sided tape alreay in place.	1
	the h can be removed fairly easy but i made the dealer remove mine and as part of the deal.	1
	of copurse, you want to leave the genesis badge on the trunk.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5087#msg5087re: very interesting!!!	1
	[colloquor]        funny you should mention that, when i bought my toyota, the salesperson was the top selling at the dealership.	1
	his main ride, an m3.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5088#msg5088re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]         so i guess you don't think that anything that can be sold for more than what a mfgr is asking for it - says anything about that company's ability to produce such products.	1
	talk about dumb?	1
	don't try and change it up...your statement was that the car needed to be sold for a premium price in order for it to better the hyundai name.	1
	of course i nkow anything can be sold for more than what the mfgr is asking.	1
	however, the issue is the current status of economic times.	1
	that is why it's hard to believe that a dealer would be putting that kind of mark up on a genesis.	1
	captain, you already put your foot in your mouth by saying hyundai shoppers don't have a clue.	1
	quit while you're ahead.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5089#msg5089re: hyundai dealer from another planet [backy]         we can group you in with the people incapable of understanding things like adm.                no you missed my point completely, i am one of those few that do understand adm and indeed have paid it on more than one occassion.	1
	call it the curse of the car nut - i'm always seeming to want the cars that are in high demand.	1
	even one of my last purchases, the 05 avalon i still drive, was only available with $3k+  dealer/distributor add-ons packages that were essentially worthless when i bought it.	1
	there are a number of ways for a dealer to pump his profits, it is not limited to simply adding something to the window sticker and they all will do it if they can.	1
	the whole concept of the genesis being sold at a premium is an interesting one to me because one one hand: it is a car that has enough content that it could conceivably justify it -  but on the other hand, it is a hyundai, a brand where such things do not happen.	1
	despite allmet's protestations, it is a good thing for hyundai that they finally have a vehicle that can command a premium - down the raod it might mean a few hundred bucks more on his azera trade-in.	1
	i've actually had a couple of other experiences at hyundai dealers, one several years ago looking over the sonata vs. the altima 3.5 i eventually bought - i'm sorry the 03 sonata was an anemic pos comparatively - although it was definitely cheaper.	1
	the other more recent was looking at the santa fe - and it was ok, although the sticker in the high 20s left me wondering 'who are they kidding'.	1
	i thought it seriously overpriced.	1
	i am batting zero though - in any effort to find anybody at a hyundai dealer that knows squat.	1
	and simply can't imagine why hyundai would allow those folks like i've encountered try to sell something like the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5090#msg5090overvaluing the dealer staff        captain, i'm not quite sure why you are placing so much value (good or bad) on the sales staff to begin with.	1
	i haven't spoken to a showroom sales person in years other than to come along for the test drive.	1
	when i go in to look at the car, i know as much or more than anyone on site.	1
	i test drive wherever convenient, make it abundantly clear that i'm just testing and not ready to buy, then do my comparison shopping, and deal exclusively with the internet sales manager when making my purchase.	1
	so they have a 20+ year old who doesn't have every car on the lot memorized.	1
	who cares?	1
	you either like the car or you don't, you either like the price or you don't.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5091#msg5091re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]         ...it is a hyundai, a brand where such things do not happen.	1
	you keep saying that.	1
	you obviously know little or nothing about what prices dealers have charged over the years for hyundais, so why do you keep harping on this point, on which you are dead wrong?	1
	can we start talking more about the genesis sedan vs. your disbelief that a hyundai dealer can and does try to charge more than msrp for their cars--genesis et.	1
	al.	1
	?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5092#msg5092re: overvaluing the dealer staff [poodog13]         captain, i'm not quite sure why you are placing so much value (good or bad) on the sales staff to begin with                actually, i do my best to avoid them and to avoid the whole 'negotiation' process altogether.	1
	it turns out the internet is a powerful tool for both pricing and actually buying.	1
	going out and test driving something is altogether different though, also the curse of a car nut - and is where i have found the astounding lack of professionalism and knowledge at my local hyundai dealers (there are several)  quite annoying.	1
	that said, if i would have wanted to get serious about that azera, sonata, or santa fe that i was looking at, i would also be doing my best to avoid the dealer (and his 20 year old newbies) altogether.	1
	and yes,  this applies to all car dealers -  not just the ones that happen to sell korean cars.	1
	toyota and honda dealers have this 'let me do you a favor and take your money attitude' that drives me nuts as well, but i still bought the avalon, for example, with about $3 grand of adm on top of msrp                and the last time i was in a honda dealership (because my wife thought she wanted a fit) they unabashedly put a $1500.00 'market adjustment' on the price and then they told me they 'might' 'do me a favor' and reduce the adm to a mere grand - gee thanks.	1
	but at least the sales idiot that was making these astounding concessions, knew about what he was selling.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5093#msg5093re: hyundai dealer from another planet [backy]         you obviously know little or nothing about what prices dealers have charged over the years for hyundais,                                fine, backy, then you tell me about any case, in the space of the 25 years or so that hyundai has been selling cars in this country that any hyundai product has even sold at msrp, never mind with something added to it.	1
	what's that, you can't can you?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5094#msg5094re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]        today, i think you're lucky if you find a salesperson that knows his or her products as well as many of the 'car people' do.	1
	most are hired for their abilities to push the cars out the door and contribute to dealership profitability.	1
	i learned this in another industry many years ago at an e.f. hutton seminar that advertised for stock brokers.	1
	i thought being a part-time stock broker would be interesting, but after about five minutes into the seminar, it was obvious they wanted no one who knew anything about the stock market.	1
	all they wanted were salespeople who could push whatever hutton was touting.	1
	i left after about 10 minutes.	1
	so much for that foray.	1
	i wonder how many used car salespeople and burger engineers made the jump into the more 'respectable wall street' career that day.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5095#msg5095re: hyundai dealer from another planet [kenb757]        agreed - and a sorry state of affairs when we are spending so much money, isn't it?	1
	your stock 'broker' parallel is a good one, because as i said, it was at the hyundai dealers that it occurred to me that hyundai didn't want its salespeople to know anything either, knowing apparently that it is easy to 'sell' price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5096#msg5096re: hyundai dealer from another planet [kenb757]        when i bought my genesis the salesman was one of the best if not best salesman i have ever dealt with.	1
	that being said what i think is important is that the buyer should know everything about the car,remember all salesmen are trying 2make a buck so they sing the song to make it sound as appealing as possible without (i hope)crossing the line of spouting plain ole b. s. a fact i discovered after i bought my genesis is that you can get a hookup on consumer products site that will tell you the exact price the dealer paid for the car you are buying.	1
	now imho this is a great tool to have although it does cost 15 bucks i think it would be money well spent.i got my ride in january and im not sure if it would have been possible to get a better deal,due to the fear factor nobody was buying.i put down 25%,and also got a smokin % rate from the bank(setup by dealer).to be honest i really didn't think they would go 4my counter offer to buy the car,but they did.i think it will be helpful if more ppl share their experience buying their genesis with the hope of helping someone thats thinking about buying one.many things have been said about the genesis both good and bad,but after buying cars for over 40 years new and used imo i got the best deal i have ever gotten on a new car.......... across the board,price,quality,dealer interaction,it was just very painless and imo just a great car.i didn't say a perfect car i said a great car that is fun to drive and it looks and rides good.thats the way i see it but everybody has their own experience and opinion.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5097#msg5097re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]        you changed the subject.	1
	we were discussing a hyundai dealer tacking on an additional markup over msrp onto the asking price of a genesis sedan, and then you claimed that this had never been done before with a hyundai.	1
	now you have switched to whether any hyundai has ever sold in the usa for msrp or more.	1
	but if you are interested to see reports on hyundais selling for msrp sometime during hyundai's 25 year history in the us, rather than discussing the genesis sedan, there's several years' worth of buying reports in the various 'prices paid' discussions for hyundais here in town hall.	1
	as a hint, look for times when a new model was introduced, e.g.	1
	early 2005 when the all-new sonata came out, or in 2007 when the veracruz debuted, or in 2008 when the genesis sedan first came out.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5098#msg5098re: hyundai dealer from another planet [backy]         you claimed that this had never been done before with a hyundai.	1
	now you have switched to whether any hyundai has ever sold in the usa for msrp or more.	1
	is your understanding of the king's english different than mine?	1
	same subject - a hyundai product selling with some sort of adm                so your telling me that the sonata sold at or above msrp in 06 or the veracruz in 07?	1
	not to anybody with an iq (or credit rating) above their body temperature!	1
	don't believe that the genesis generally did either, judging by the 'prices paid' reports in these forums - and that, as i said earlier, would be the one vehicle that hyundai has ever made where it might be possible.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5099#msg5099re: hyundai dealer from another planet [captain2]        a hyundai with an adm sticker on it (your original discussion point) and a hyundai                  selling                 for msrp or more (your new discussion point) are two different things.	1
	so i guess my understanding of the king's english                 is                different than yours.	1
	why is it so difficult to believe that someone would pay msrp or more for the all-new 2006 sonata or all-new 2007 veracruz or all-new genesis?	1
	if someone would pay $3000 over msrp for a widely available appliance car like the avalon, why not a hyundai?       	1

	this opinion is unlikely to be influenced through contrary experience, rationalization, or dissection of language and/or phrasology.	1
	the resulting back-and-forth has completely disrailed any dialogue and subsequent insights that might be gained if in fact the conversation returns to the hyundai genesis itself.	1

	you'll be looking at a significant repair bill.	1
	make sure you have the updated vvt oil supply line (without the rubber intermediate portion) from toyota, otherwise it's an accident waiting for a place to happen, and it means $$$$ out of pocket as toyota typically doesn't cover the cost of the new engine.       	1

	introduction of the equus will cause me to wait a while longer or look at another make until equus has been here for a couple of years.	1
	according to hyundai think tank site, it appears equus is right around the corner - january or summer 2010?	1
	they already have 10 korean versions touring the country.	1
	even though i live in most affluent and largest metro area of sc, i have seen very few azera or genesis' in the last six months.	1
	in fact only seen one genesis at all off a dealer's lot.	1
	they are offering discounts up to $3,000 on genesis sedans in this area.	1
	see lots and lots of bmw, mb, lexus, infiniti, acura, etc.	1
	equus will take sales away from genesis, the way genesis did from azera.	1

	i don't see it quite that way.	1
	while i agree the equus could take a few sales away from genesis, i think it will increase genesis sales  more than it hurts.	1
	i honestly believe genesis made such a stir that it sold a lot of sonata's and even a few azera's.	1
	the equus could work the same way.	1
	you sit in a very nice car, and suddenly your perception of the entire line changes, rightly or wrongly.	1
	i think introducing a very nice top line model is a no lose situation.	1
	new introductions that flop would not be a disaster at hyundai like it used to be in detroit.	1
	hyundai uses their own robots, and computerized tooling is very quick to design, manufacture, and install.	1
	they get a roi much faster than detroit, so their sales and market share wouldn't have to be high at all in a world market.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5114#msg5114re: info please [alross]        i can tell you it will be very hard to find a premium only package.	1
	a premium plus (18' wheels) is pretty common on the lots here in nj.	1
	the dealer had to jump through hoops to get my cabernet/cashmere with premium package only (i don't like the v6's 18' wheels).	1
	what i would do is goto hyundai's website and put in a charlotte or raleigh zip code and get the dealer names then google their websites and check inventory.	1
	sort it by price and you'll (hopefully) find what you are looking for.	1
	also i believe there still is a low money factor and $1000 rebate on leases.       	1

	[carolinabob]         'according to hyundai think tank site, it appears equus is right around the corner'                                really, you still believe this?	1
	the think tank introduced the equus discussion forum only 4 days ago with a 2 minute video (shot with a handy-cam in hyundai's orange county parking lot) and the question, 'do you think it's suitable for the us market?'	1
	'equus will take sales away from genesis, the way genesis did from azera.	1
	not the time to introduce a $50,000+ car that will hurt own models.'	1
	1. of course nobody's buying the azera.	1
	for $25,000 you can get a stripped azera gls with cloth seats or a sonata with leather and power moonroof.	1
	for $32,000, you can get a loaded azera ltd or a genesis.	1
	in 2006, it was a korean alternative to the toyota avalon/buick lacrosse.	1
	today, it's irrelevant.	1
	2. i think that if/when the equus comes to the us, it will sticker for a lot more than $50,000 - more like $60 - $70,000.	1
	but, even at $50,000+, that's almost $10,000 more than a fully loaded v8 genesis.	1
	i don't think too many people shopping for the genesis are going to think, 'hmm, for only $200 or $300/month more, i could have an equus.'	1
	i think the genesis should/will remain the hyundai flagship in the us for at least 2 or 3 years.	1
	eventually, if/when the equus does come here, it will be too expensive to compete with the genesis.       	1

	i don't think hyundai has anything to lose, and a lot to gain by introducing the equus.	1
	as i stated earlier, it's very cheap to produce a usa legal version.	1
	it could be introduced very rapidly and painlessly, and withdrawn just as quickly if it doesn't work out.	1

	the phaeton didn't do anything to hurt volkswagon.	1
	on the other hand, you don't build a high-rise building on top of a weak foundation.	1
	i think hyundai should devote it's resources on strengthening their current lineup (get rid of the elantra and azera) and improve quality and performance to compete in their respective classes (sonata - accord/camry fighter and genesis coupe - 3-series/g37 fighter).	1
	let the genesis carry the guide-on for a few years, then, when americans are ready to wrap their brains around a $60,000 hyundai, bring in the equus.       	1

	i think the equus would replace genesis as the foundation, with the econoboxes on top.	1
	a car company trying to improve their image should introduce nice cars, assuming they don't already have any.	1
	i think equus will start at $55k, maybe even $50k.	1

	toyota introduced lexus with the ls400, and things seem to have worked out well for them.	1
	your guess about the equus price also seems more realistic than mine.	1
	according to wikipedia (fwiw), the genesis sells for the equivalent of about $57,000 us in korea.	1
	the equus sells for about $96,000.	1
	so if the ratio stays the same, that would make the equus start at about $54,000.	1

	the avalon is shown to run 0-60 anywhere from high 6's to low 7's and the genesis 3.8 is shown to run low to mid 6's.	1
	how does that equate to blowing the doors off anything hyundai makes???	1
	heck, even the azera is hitting low to mid 7's 0-60 my friend.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5140#msg5140re: equus effect?	1
	[marvinlee1]         the genesis is a much older design than is generally understood here.	1
	actually marvinlee1...the concept of the equus is much older than that of the genesis, here's an entry on wikipedia that shows the equus getting its start as early as 1999:                 wikipedia:  hyundai equus                                according to wikipedia info.	1
	concept for the genesis began in 2003 and the actual concept vehicle was introduced in 2007.                                remember back in 2002 when they dropped the hcd-7...it was given the equus name.	1
	hyundai hcd-7 equus concept                                in all honesty...the hcd-7 is the one they should have moved forward with.	1
	the styling would have given them a very unique character on the road, even if it does look like a bentley from the rear.	1
	this was one sweet design i was sad to see them pass on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5141#msg5141re: hyundai dealer from another planet [allmet33]        even better than that.	1
	consumer guide had the '08 azera at 6.2 seconds to 60. car and driver had the '06 edition at 6.1.                                which makes sense, considering it's a very similar engine to the genesis 3.8 in a car that weighs less.       	1

	somewhat akin to saying i prefer the feel of the mustang to the town car...                                not so fast, lilengineerboy.	1
	the numbers don't lie.	1
	even the long-wheelbase li version of the 750 is less than 10 inches longer than the genesis 4.6, and weighs only 305 pounds more.	1
	that's not enough difference to hang any heavy excuses on.	1
	one other number needs mentioning here, too: the bmw's base price of $84,200, which is more than twice the $42,000 tab for a genesis with the full boat of options.	1
	that amount of money is supposed to buy you the exotic materials and sophisticated engineering to free you from compromises such as 'boat-like' road manners.	1
	one thing is for sure: if history is any guide, the extra money certainly doesn't buy you greater reliability.	1
	other than the hyundai's regrettable fake wood, in fact, i'm not sure just what great dimension of superiority there is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5143#msg5143re: august automobile magazine [tonycd]        are you referring to the fake wood in the lower end hyundai models?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5144#msg5144re: august automobile magazine [tonycd]        why stop at the bmw 750?	1
	the genesis is almost as fast and handles almost as well as a bentley continental flying spur - and the bentley costs $240,000!	1
	the bentley also gets horrible gas mileage and isn't as reliable.	1
	other than the real wood trim, i can't see any reason to spend the extra $200,000 for the bentley.	1
	the genesis is, in many ways, a better car!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5145#msg5145re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        well,,, i guess every car is better than all other cars in some way.	1
	but your statement clearly issustrates diminishing returns in ever more expensive cars.	1
	a $30k car should be much better than a $15k car, and it is.	1
	an $80k car should be much better in many ways than a $40k car, but it isn't.	1
	somewhere, there is a magic price range where extra quality and features for your dollar start falling off rapidly.	1
	i think it's somewhere between $30 and $40k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5146#msg5146re: august automobile magazine [tenpin288]        since 'bob' seems to be mia or does not want to post the info i asked for, i will.	1
	i just received the automobile issue he quoted from and there are only two comments in this long-term update he references.	1
	here is the other:                                 7224 miles: question of the month: hyundai genesis or jaguar xf?	1
	'call me crazy, but i'd sooner plop down my own money for a genesis than an xf,' says floraday.	1
	'the genesis doesn't ride or handle as well, but it's been bulletproof and costs half as much.'	1
	this and the quote referenced by 'bob' are the only updates to automobile's long term test this month.	1
	hardly something to either cause condemnation or praise to be heaped on the genesis.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5147#msg5147re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        the bently has a top speed of 202 mph and a 0 to 60 of 4.3. of course 6 seconds is kind of in the neighboorhood of 4.3 if your spending 200k large.	1
	the 750i hits 60 south of 4.9 and the engineering is impeccable.	1
	of course for 90k large it should be like that.	1
	a subaru wrx sti can hit 60 in 4.8. of course it's not a large sedan, but can go where all of these other boats can't.	1
	performance is just one measure of a cars worth.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5148#msg5148re: august automobile magazine [kdshapiro]        road  track published that the genesis 4.6 runs 0-60 in 5.5 seconds...6/10's of a second behind a car costing twice as much???	1
	i can save $40k+ and live with being .6 seconds slower than a 7 series!!!	1
	no way to really tell what the top speed on the genesis is, because it's electronically limited to 149 mph (which my azera is capable of getting close to that...around 145 i believe).	1
	the 750i is limited to 155 mph...again, another difference i can save $40k+ and live with.	1
	i'm sure if the limiter were removed, it (the genesis) would probably be capable of running between 175-190, considering it has more than 100 hp more than my azera.	1
	genesis 4.6                                there are features that you can get on the 7-series that hyundai hasn't even considered to this point.	1
	night vision w/ pedestrian recognition, hud, lane departure warning system, active 4 wheel steering...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5149#msg5149re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        heck, i have a lane departure warning system and it's free.	1
	it's called 'my wife':  'omg, you are too close to the curb/centerline!'	1
	i know hyundais sold in the rok have features not available on us-spec cars.	1
	for example, the gen 4 sonata has an active geometry control system available in the rok.	1
	so i wonder what toys come on the genesis elsewhere but not here?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5150#msg5150re: august automobile magazine [backy]        backy...okay, you got me sitting in my office laughing so hard folks think i'm crazy!	1
	rotfl  i guess since you put it that way, there's a lot of us that have that feature and it's not brand specific either!	1
	you're right, it seems the hometown versions of the vehicles get features  'toys' we aren't privvy to here on this side of the pond.       	1

	i think it's somewhere between $30 and $40k.'	1
	i agree completely.	1
	$30k seems to be the magic number.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5152#msg5152re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        i used to consider that the break point.	1
	but i think it's a bit higher now, thanks to cars like the infiniti m-series.	1
	i'd put it at about $45k now.	1
	still, the genesis 3.8 is a heck of a deal in the high thirties.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5153#msg5153re: august automobile magazine [minivanguy]         are you referring to the fake wood in the lower end hyundai models?	1
	no, regrettably i'm referring to the fake wood in the genesis.	1
	personally, i think it's kind of tacky.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5154#msg5154re: august automobile magazine [tonycd]        yes, i thought it was real but after doing some research i found it to be fake.	1
	i guess it's like choosing hardwood floors over laminate.	1
	the laminate turns out to be more durable and cheaper,                and the hardwood is more elegant and expensive.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5155#msg5155re: august automobile magazine [tonycd]         i'm referring to the fake wood in the genesis                                at least there isn't that much of it on the premium package on up models.	1
	i do agree that on the base model the 'wood' on the dash is a bit much       	1

	but i think it's a bit higher now.'	1
	i was thinking about other 'large' entry-level luxury cars like the avalon and taurus.	1
	well equipped models, like the genesis, start at about $32,000.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5158#msg5158re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        perhaps the first time i've ever seen 'entry-level luxury' and taurus in the same sentence!	1
	in terms of american car lines, i think buick might be the only name that makes a car that competes in terms of price, size, and 'entry-level luxury' with the genesis.	1
	granted, the performance specs don't come close, but if we have to find one to compare, that would be it.	1
	nothing made by caddy or lincoln provides the size-to-price ratio to truly be in the same class.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5159#msg5159re: august automobile magazine [poodog13]        sorry, but how would the genesis be considered 'entry-level luxury'???	1
	if anything, that conotation would go to the azera.	1
	the only thing entry-level in regards to the genesis is the pricing.	1
	you get a full luxury sedan at the price most entry-level sedans cost.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5160#msg5160re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        amen!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5161#msg5161re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         'the only thing entry-level in regards to the genesis is the pricing.'	1
	the azera, in size, price, and features, is more a family sedan than an entry-luxury sedan.	1
	i admit the lines blur as the family sedan class keeps growing in size and luxury, but if you look at the specs, the azera is more similar to the accord and camry in price, size, etc.	1
	the genesis has much more in common with the avalon, taurus, and yes, buick lucerne.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5162#msg5162re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        buick lucerne is definitely in the same conversation with the genesis.	1
	i'll have to wait and see on the reliability, but that's a nice car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5163#msg5163re: august automobile magazine [bobad]        i don't know much about the buick.	1
	glancing at specs though, the 2010 lacrosse looks much nicer than the lucerne (dated looks, only 227hp, 4-speed tranny, etc.).	1
	i'm guessing the lucerne is larger?	1
	and to keep things on course, one obvious advantage the genesis has over these other cars is rwd (though admittedly, i don't think it makes any (performance) difference in this segment).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5164#msg5164re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        funny you should point that out.	1
	the rwd is perhaps the only thing i can say                 against                this car.	1
	i live in a very hilly area on the northeast, and i work in sales.	1
	having to drive on snow-covered, hilly roads is unavoidable for me.	1
	a rwd platform with no awd option makes it very hard for me to be comfortable with this vehicle for my own purposes.	1
	i will tell you though, if i've ever considered taking a leap of faith and taking my chances, it's on this car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5165#msg5165re: august automobile magazine [fedlawman]        i don't know about the future of the lucerne but buick says that the new 2010 lacrosse is their new flagship.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5169#msg5169re: long drive [miklo]        just remember that if you paid 7% interest when you financed the genesis, and the bank paid you 4% interest on your savings, you lost money.,       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5171#msg5171re: long drive [stephen987]        you have to take into account that my interest rate that i am getting will compound and there is less than 1% difference from what im paying and the interest im getting from my annunity.i do understand the difference but the way i see it is, it only cost me about 1% to use their money,of course the old saying comes to mind that liars figure but figures dont lie.i also get comfort in knowing that i got all my money in the bank(this may just be a head game im playing on myself but it works 4me)waiting for me to do something.so no matter what it cost or how much im paying im happy with my genesis and can afford the payment which is the bottom line 4me.this is why i really like this forum there is a wealth of info here for me and anyone else thats interested.	1

	with the backup camera you can see good looking women walking by.	1
	each one of the numbers on the gps display(probably about 25 on each screen) actually mean something and are recomputed constantly.	1
	you can talk to this car and it will talk to you.	1

	right next to the genesis in my garage is a 1925 fully functional model t ford which in its own way is also fun to drive.	1
	but wow.	1
	cars have come a long way!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5179#msg5179re: august automobile magazine [bobad]         buick lucerne is definitely in the same conversation with the genesis.	1
	i'll have to wait and see on the reliability, but that's a nice car.	1
	really???	1
	lucerne  genesis...night  day!!!	1
	now maybe the new lucerne that's getting ready to hit the streets can be more comparable to the genesis, but the current one can't even hold a candle to the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5180#msg5180re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         but the current one can't even hold a candle to the genesis.	1
	depends what you are looking for...  if its a quiet, plush ride with lots of room i think it gives the genesis a run.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5181#msg5181re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        mmmmmmmmmmmm...if that's the case, you can also compare it to an old mercury grand marquis as well!	1
	the nod would have to go to the genesis, much more power and still get better fuel economy to boot!!!	1
	and it gets even better if you step up to the v-8 model.	1
	in v-6 form, the fe numbers are relatively close, but the difference with the v-8 versions is huge, especially when you factor in the difference in hp.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5182#msg5182re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         the nod would have to go to the genesis, much more power and still get better fuel economy to boot!	1
	i agree with all that... heck even the toyota avalon beats the lucerne there.	1
	what i am saying is, if the buyer's primary concern is a big car with a smooth, quiet, plush ride the lucerne is a better choice.	1
	as for the grand marquis, those cars have their place too in really the same way as the lucerne does.	1
	i'll always have a soft spot for those boats.	1
	(probably because my grandfather has owned either a town car or marquis since i was born)       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5183#msg5183re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        really?	1
	imho this is like comparing apples and oranges,of course they both do have four tires but in my book thats about as close as they get to being alike.this is only my opinion........ could be wrong!	1
	miklo       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5184#msg5184re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        yes, but when you start looking at what exactly you're paying for...in the end, you get more car for the money with the genesis vs. the lucerne.	1
	heck, to get a lucerne that competes with the genesis performance-wise, you would have to get the lucerne 4.6 to keep up with the genesis 3.8 and you lose out big in fuel economy.	1
	heck, you could save a lot more money and get the azera as it gives a similar ride as the buick, still more hp than the buick v-6 and just as many amenities.	1
	the lucerne is no more luxurious than an azera.	1
	to say the lucerne can be compared to the genesis is just silly.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5185#msg5185re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        that is it exactly.	1
	hyundai's primary competitor for the lucerne is the azera, not the genesis.	1
	but can the lucerne be compared to the genesis?	1
	of course.	1
	people will compare almost anything, and will often compare cars that cost about the same even though the cars themselves are quite different--the 'get the most car for my money' approach.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5186#msg5186re: august automobile magazine [backy]        backy...you're absolutely right.	1
	funny how toyota lovers couldn't stand the fact that the azera was being compared to the avalon.	1
	even though there are features on the avalon not found on an azera, it can still be very comparable.	1
	however, now that hyundai has the genesis, avalon lovers feel the need to use the genesis in comparison.	1
	i mean...if they must have their beloved avalon compared to a hyundai, it must be the one that won north american car of the year!	1
	the genesis is a luxury sedan, the avalon...entry level luxury just like the azera.	1
	and please (avalon lovers), don't jump out there with the belief that the avalon is more luxury because the es 350 is entry-level luxury as well and the avalon is a notch below the es.	1
	and please, this is not a knock against the avalon either...just pointing out fact.	1
	when it comes to the 'bang for buck' approach, the hyundai will almost always win when compared to vehicles of similarity.	1
	not what many want to hear, but it's the reality of it.	1
	folks just need to learn to accept the fact that what any other maker will give you in a car, hyundai will give you that and a little more...for a little less.	1
	i mean...what other car maker can give you a car that's the size of a 7-series, with everything a 5-series offers...for the price of a 3-series??	1

	although it looked good from the outside, good power, and 30 mpg on the highway.	1
	the rest of the car is subpar.	1
	the seats weren't comfortable, leather looked cheap.	1
	the layout of the inside was not desirable.	1
	cheap plastics, descent room in the back but no adjusable headrests, and uncomfortable seating.	1
	thought i was in a 20k car but was shocked to see it go for 30k.	1
	driving was very soft and floaty.	1
	stereo was below average                                bottom line if you are looking at a 30k automobile spend an additional 3k and get the base genesis!!	1
	if this is what detroit has to offer at 30k wow what a disappointment.	1
	they need to step up to the plate if they are going to compete with asia or europe       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5188#msg5188re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [toye]        sorry, but the impala (like the lucerne) is another car that just doesn't belong in a comparison with the genesis.	1
	at best...the sonata, camry  altima, however...it'll come up short in performace to all.	1
	always has, always will.	1
	i would easily take a base model genesis over a top of the line impala ss even.	1
	funny...a co-worker was doing that very thing.	1
	he wants performance, but he's always looking at cars like the lucerne, impala and such...american cars.	1
	then he always brings up how it stacks up against my azera and the one thing i point out is that it always takes an american v-8 to hang with a foreign v-6 (with the exception of the v-6 in the cti or the new 3.5 twin-turbo that will be in the taurus sho.	1
	that's just from a performance standpoint.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5189#msg5189re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]        oh i know that the impala doesn't compare with a genesis period.	1
	when i found out that i would be getting the newly designed  2009 impala with only 1500 miles on i was expecting more.	1
	it should have compared favorably to the azera.	1
	but to think people are willing to spend 30k for such a sub par vehicle when there so much better product out there is beyond me.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5190#msg5190re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [toye]        toye...one thing you gotta understand is that there are some folks that are just biased about a product and sometimes that means they must have american regardless if it is inferior to something else that's selling for the same price or slightly more.	1
	honestly, i was gung ho toyota prior to my '02 sonata, having had 3 toyotas (80 tercel, 86 1/2 supra  96 camry)...all of them were solid  bullet-proof.	1
	however, it was hard to turn down a sonata for $17,800 when toyota wanted $23k for a comparably equipped camry.	1
	having owned that sonata is what opened my eyes to the 'other' options.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5191#msg5191re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         however, now that hyundai has the genesis, avalon lovers feel the need to use the genesis in comparison.	1
	guess what?	1
	the avalon is very much a competitor to the genesis.	1
	in some ways the avalon is the better car.	1
	let me explain:                                the avalon is roomier with a reclining rear seat and flat rear floor.	1
	toyota's 3.5 is much more refined than hyundai's 3.8.                                the toyota's ride is light years ahead of the genesis in terms of isolating the road and soaking up imperfections                                the avalon has just about every creature comfort that the genesis has available.	1
	now before anyone thinks i am crazy i just came out of an '06 avalon to a genesis.... so i think my opinion does have some merit.	1
	the genesis does do a lot well.	1
	the handling is                 much                better than the avalon.	1
	the genesis is quieter                fit and finish is on par or a little better than the avalon                interior materials are a notch above the avalon.	1
	i chose the genesis because it was a good value, and i wanted something 'different'.	1
	i like it, but honestly i think that it is nothing more than a premium full size car that competes with other 35k+ sedans.... not 50k on up luxury nameplates.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5192#msg5192re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [toye]        i too rented an impala recently, for a vacation trip in central tx (no, i didn't want the impala, but it was that or a focus for a family of 5).	1
	it was a mid-level model with cloth, but it had some good attributes: relatively good fe (high 20s in mixed driving with my light foot), very comfortable driver's seat, powerful ac (really appreciated that), quiet and smooth highway ride, big trunk, nice trip computer.	1
	my 13 year old daughter actually liked the car, much to my surprise.	1
	but nothing close to a genesis, or an azera for that matter.	1
	i was thinking, for a year-old used car for $10k (yes, used impalas are available at that price), for someone who drives a lot on the highway and likes a 'traditional big-car ride', might not be a bad car.	1
	but as a new car?	1
	nope.	1
	i'd spend the extra for a genesis.	1
	i have a feeling the new taurus will be able to give the genesis 3.8 a run for its money though.	1
	have to drive the taurus to see, but i'm impressed from what i've seen of it so far.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5193#msg5193re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         in the end, you get more car for the money with the genesis vs. the lucerne.	1
	you are right there, i was just trying to point out that no matter what the 'value' is for some people the genesis will not be the right full size car because the sportier tuned ride.	1
	as for pricing remember the lucerne will sell for a lot less than any genesis, especially if you figure in 0% financing the gm is clinging onto in order to move some metal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5194#msg5194re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        it's a competitor in terms of v-6 vs. v-6.	1
	while the 3.5 is more refined, the 3.8 is matching fuel economy numbers with it's 'lack' of refinement.	1
	hmmmmmmmmm...wonder if that really bodes well for toyota.	1
	flat floor...yes, you can get away with that in a fwd car, rwd don't really think it's workable in a car.	1
	the rear may be roomier and offers reclining seats, but with the amount of room the genesis rear seats offers, i doubt anyone would be complaining.	1
	in terms of handling, it really boils down to your taste.	1
	there are plenty of genesis owners that love the ride as much as you love the ride in the avalon.	1
	i tested a genesis and found it to ride even better than my azera.	1
	it's just odd that you point out the avalon being the much better car and yet, you chose the genesis yourself.	1
	funny, you don't think the genesis should be compared with $50k cars and yet...most of the publications have and have shown the genesis to hold it's own against them in terms of fit  finish and quality of materials.	1
	i definitely applaud your leap, but i see it took the genesis to make you take that leap.	1
	either way, i think you'll find the experience to be rather pleasant if you remain completely honest with yourself.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5195#msg5195re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [backy]        take a look at the inside line's comparison between the taurus sho vs. the infinity g37.	1
	the sho nicely optioned will run $40k+, not sure many will bite on those numbers.	1
	an sho pumping out 365 ponies for $45k or a genesis pumping out 368 ponies for $42k fully loaded.	1
	regardless of what is thought, the taurus is indeed the best taurus ford has produced to this point.	1
	taurus sho vs. g37        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5197#msg5197re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        you know what's funny about what you said though, in terms of the genesis maybe not being the right full sized sedan for some...you find those very people then looking at the g37, tl and the es350.	1
	none of which are full sized sedans.	1
	the initial look is at the genesis because it fits the price range they are shopping, but to get a car by another make for that same price...you step down to the lower models.	1
	personally, the value is in getting the flagship model fully loaded for a price i would pay for a fully loaded entry-level model or moderately equipped mid-level model.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5198#msg5198re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         it's just odd that you point out the avalon being the much better car and yet, you chose the genesis yourself                                after 3 toyota and two avalons in particular i just wanted something different.	1
	the '09 avalon is the same as the '06 i had.	1
	also i wanted rwd and the only vehicles in my price range were the infiniti g (much too small) the 300/charger (never!	1
	), or the g8.	1
	on paper the genesis has everything you would want and its a good car but after 2500 miles i just wouldn't put it in a class above its price.	1
	i guess my biggest argument is that everyone thinks there is no car in the genesis's price range can compete, i just flat out disagree.	1
	while the 3.5 is more refined, the 3.8 is matching fuel economy numbers with it's 'lack' of refinement.	1
	i am seeing about a 1 - 1.5 mpg drop from my avalon.	1
	with the little bit of extra power the 3.8 has i would say its a wash in terms of fe       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5199#msg5199re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]        as i said, i think the taurus (not sho) will stack up well against the genesis                 3.8                .	1
	the taurus has features the genesis does not and either fwd or awd, which many folks prefer over rwd.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5200#msg5200re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        i'm certainly not mad at your line of thinking.	1
	the g8 would be rather attractive, but with pontiac going out of business soon, the attraction dims considerably...however, you would be one of the few that would have one.	1
	now in terms of getting the rwd, there are no cars in that price range that compete with the genesis and give you what you get.	1
	like you said...the g37, but it's smaller.	1
	you hardly want to step up to the gs line, that's more money.	1
	300/charger are options, but hardly stack up against the genesis.	1
	both are getting long in the tooth in regards to styling.	1
	so...while technically, there are a couple cars that can compete price-wise with the genesis, you're comparing fwd to rwd and that changes the dynamic a bit.	1
	folks try to use rwd as a knock against the genesis, but do they realize how many taxi cabs in cities like new york or chicago that go through harsh winters and are rwd???	1
	either a good set of snow tires or chains make a world of difference.	1
	in an area like the dc metro...a good set of all season tires would be just fine.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5201#msg5201re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        i looked at lots of cars (actually i am always looking                ) before leasing my genesis.	1
	the es350 is nice, but small (again basically a smaller slightly nicer avalon).	1
	my biggest requirement is it must be a full size sedan, which limits my choices quite a bit                                the genesis overall is doing fine for me right now.	1
	i do like that everyone asks me what it is and that you don't see one at every corner (actually i never see any).	1
	the lease was atttractive and i am comfortable in it.	1
	i am still surprised how well it handles, i just wish the ride was a little more like my avalon and the powertrain was a little more responsive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5202#msg5202re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [backy]        what features will the taurus offer that the genesis doesn't other than sync???	1
	taurus with a curb weight of 4224 lbs.	1
	will be using 263 hp to propel it, while the genesis has a curb weight of 3748 lbs.	1
	uses 290 hp.	1
	throw awd in on the taurus and the weight goes up.	1
	i really don't see the taurus stacking up too well.	1
	another case of american ingenuity falling short of it's foreign counterparts.	1
	honestly...rwd could be an issue for folks that live in areas like buffalo, boston or places like that.	1
	cabbies in ny, chi-town and cities like that have driven cars with rwd with no problems for decades.	1
	heck, i had no problems with my 86 1/2 supra here in the dc metro.	1
	awd is nice, but it comes at a cost too, more weight, lower fe, and more to maintain as well.	1
	good snow tires or chains solve that problem.	1
	all this and the starting price of the taurus is $2000+ more than that of the genesis,  and the mkz is $5k+ more for a 'luxury' version of the taurus, based on edmunds tmv pricing.	1
	vehicle comparo        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5203#msg5203re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        one more quick thing...  i never said the avalon was the                 much better car                only that it does have some advantages over the genesis and that imo they are very much competitors.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5204#msg5204re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        trust me, i'm like you...always looking.	1
	i hurt myself by test driving the genesis 3.8 w/premium package when they were first trickling into the dealers.	1
	as much as i really love my azera, i fell in love with the genesis.	1
	so much so, my wife is worried i'll go and trade my azera in.	1
	the only thing holding me back is that the azera is paid for and i really don't want a car note right now.	1
	here's a question for you, honestly...how much more responsive do you need the powertrain to be for a full-sized luxury family sedan???	1
	if it were listed as a 'sport' sedan, i could see someone clamoring for more powertrain response, and maybe you've been spoiled by toyota engineering.	1
	is the genesis really that lacking or are you being greedy and just want more?        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5205#msg5205re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        actually...you did say the avalon was the better car.	1
	okay, i added 'much', but the way you proceeded to point out how you felt it was the better car...much seemed appropriate.	1
	go back and look at:                 post # 5192        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5206#msg5206re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         maybe you've been spoiled by toyota engineering.	1
	is the genesis really that lacking or are you being greedy and just want more?	1
	maybe a little bit of both.	1
	the toyota engine just wanted to be revved in a way the hyundai doesn't.	1
	the way the power came on at 4000 and above rpm is fantastic.	1
	i see your point i am not driving a vette, however you can have still have a little fun in a family car                .	1
	being completely fair to the genesis, its not completely broken in yet and it is plenty quick.	1
	the avalon just felt faster to me and the engine more refined at higher rpm                                as for my previous post, i guess i did a bad job at conveying the point that the av and genesis are comparable and that the avalon does some things better than the genesis and vice versa.	1
	as for which one is the better car?	1
	i am sure if you go by the car mags the genesis will win every time due to rwd and better handling, ultimately though, it comes down to what the driver is looking for.	1
	imo you probably couldn't go wrong with either one.	1
	i am torn...  i want it all avalon ride/engine with the genesis handling and interior...  oh that does exist just costs a heck of a lot more        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5207#msg5207re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        i betcha money that hyundai will come up with closer solution to your ideal situation than any other car maker including toyota       	1

	one of the things i had the pleasure of doing was turning the esc off at a stop sign, then i punched the gas pedal as i made my turn.	1
	the back end broke loose and started to swing around as i had hoped.	1
	it was very predictable and easy to control...a very well balanced car.	1
	i guess that's the advantage of getting a test drive with no sales person riding along.	1
	also, don't forget the ability to put the car in manual shift mode too.	1
	it allows you to hold a gear a little longer than in automatic mode.	1
	i think one thing that makes a difference is the torque on the genesis.	1
	it's not the kind of car that snaps your head back on take-off, however...it accelerates so smoothly that you're hitting 70-80 before you realize it.	1
	a trip up to triple-digits would be just as smooth and seamless.	1
	the fact that it does accelerate with such smoothness, maybe that belies it's ability and the fact that the interior is so quiet takes away from the rev fun you might have...try it with the windows down and you'll get to hear a sweeter tune from the engine an exhaust when you pull off.	1
	you're right, to be honest...you won't go wrong with either vehicle.	1
	some will just have a harder time giving the hyundai product it's just dues.	1
	like you, they are quick to say the engine isn't as 'refined' and yet...it performs just as well as the toyota engine in terms of accelerating and fuel economy.       	1

	they both cost $30k, and are close to the same size, so they should be compared.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5211#msg5211re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [bobad]         they both cost $30k, and are close to the same size, so they should be compared.	1
	if that is what you want to base a comparison on...that's like bringing a knife to a gun fight.	1
	would you put a $500 8' knife up against a $500 8' gun?	1
	first of all, to even touch the genesis with the impala, you would need to look at the impala ss.	1
	however, you would then get a v-8 that would not compare in terms of fe, bland styling that's just old and not much else to be honest.	1
	however, for the sake of saying it's a big car that cost $30k...be my guest.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5212#msg5212re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]        all i'm saying is that it is valid to compare any 4 door sedan that costs $30-$35k with the v6 genesis.	1
	anyone in his right mind goes shopping for a car with a set price range.	1
	you look at all cars in that price range, and make your choice.	1
	the all around best car (to your taste and in your opinion) is the 1 you buy.	1
	i have not driven the impala, but i highly doubt i would choose it over the genesis.	1
	but i would be silly not to try it out, just like others are silly not to drive the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5213#msg5213re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]         what features will the taurus offer that the genesis doesn't other than sync???	1
	let's see... awd for one.	1
	both front seats cooled for two.	1
	massaging seats for three.	1
	ability to set the max speed of the car (for teenagers maybe) for four.	1
	snyc for five.	1
	i could go on but you get the idea.	1
	you had no problems with your rwd supra in dc metro.	1
	ha ha ha ha ha!!	1
	that's a good one.	1
	i had no problems with my '82 celica in houston either.	1
	try cities like denver, minneapolis/st.	1
	paul, chicago, detroit, and in fact any part of the country that regularly gets snow.	1
	i've been in cabs driven in snow and they were not having fun doing it.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5214#msg5214re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [bobad]        again when i found out that i renting the brand new impala i was secretly hoping that the american made automobile would impress me and challenge my decision on why i bought the 3.8 v6 genesis.	1
	what so sad that very little of even came close as far as quality, design, style.	1
	everything the impala had the genesis did better or much better.	1
	the driver seat did have 8  way electronic control but lacked the electronic lumbar button.	1
	the impala didn't have any vents for the back seating.	1
	the moon roof when open sat on top of the roof, not inside like the genesis.	1
	i keep looking for the d, r etc down at the gearshift.	1
	it was in front of the steering wheel inside the speedometer.	1
	the gearshift was plain, dull and no personality.	1
	the impala may have been better was the  gas mileage and not by very much.	1
	oh the only thing that i did like on the impala, that the genesis doesn't have  was that the car chimed if i forgot to turn off the turning signal.	1
	if this is one of the best a mid sized american automobile we are in a lot of trouble.	1
	i hope the 2010 taurus will be much better       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5215#msg5215re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]         honestly...rwd could be an issue for folks that live in areas like buffalo, boston or places like that.	1
	cabbies in ny, chi-town and cities like that have driven cars with rwd with no problems for decades.	1
	"\                                agreed, but the lack of optional awd is                 killing                genesis sales in my relatively affluent nyc suburb."	1
	almost every infiniti m  g, bmw 3  5, mercedes c  e  lexus gs that you'll see on the streets of my town has awd.	1
	(to get a 3-series bimmer with rwd, i had to place a factory order.you won't find one in dealer stock.)	1
	now i happen to believe that we in the nyc metro area really don't need awd, but what i think doesn't matter.	1
	give folks around here a choice between awd  rwd,  they'll vote with their wallets for awd 49 times out of 50.                                i could count the number of genesis sightings on the fingers of one hand  still have a couple of fingers left over.	1
	unless hyundai is content with niche status for the gen in one of the country's most important markets, it simply must offer awd pronto.       	1

	the taurus is a much better taurus than has ever been built to date, but to compare it to the genesis...it's going to fall short.	1
	i mean, yes...there will be features you can get on it that the genesis doesn't have, but...the car will feel sluggish simply because you're asking the engine to pull over 4000 lbs of car.	1
	at least with the sho, you get 365 ponies under the hood, but that would still fall short against the genesis 4.6 which is like 500 lbs lighter than the sho.	1

	in terms of the 'bling for the buck , the new taurus is every bit the car that the v6 genesis is - arguably even a better 'value', and even with a better brand perception.	1

	not quite sure you've looked at the pricing for the new taurus.	1
	while invoice price seems to be quite close, looking at edmunds tmv pricing puts the taurus up $3k over the genesis.	1
	the point i've been making is that while you do get a much improved taurus, it will be quite sluggish compared to the genesis because it has less hp to push around more weight...and that's without the awd feature.	1
	puh-lease...bling for the buck, the taurus offers no bling, for that...you would need to look to the over-priced lincoln mkz which is nothing more than an upscale taurus.	1

	ford...better brand perception???	1
	yeah, okay...just like folks mention hyundai's disposable days, there are still plenty of folks that remember when ford stood for found on road dead or friggin' ol' rebuilt dodge!!!	1
	just like hyundai, ford has improved...however, to say they are perceived as the better brand...can't go along for that ride.	1

	to answer your question...yes, it is harder to keep up with the vehicle names in terms of 4 different vehicles all starting with the mk designation.	1
	using 328, 335, etc is a bad example because they are all in the 3-series and each one denotes the type of engine that particular model may have.	1
	mks, mkx, mxt  mkz are all different vehicles with two being sedans and two being crossovers.	1
	can't imagine how they ran out of numbers when they stopped at viii.	1
	unless they simply skipped ix and the mkx is actually a mark 10.  i mean...x looks so much cooler than ix.	1
	tsx, tl, rl, mdx  rdx are very easy to keep up with simply because the 1st two letters are pretty much different for each model.	1
	basically...lincoln has simply shown a lack of creativity in terms of naming their current line-up.	1
	it is what it is and i made a minor faux pas in mixing up two vehicles.	1
	i'm human, it happens and i'm sure i'm not the only one to have ever made that mistake in particular with the mks  mkz.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5245#msg5245re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [allmet33]        since the 2010 taurus is pretty much still a show car, i was talking about the current 09s which are selling today even cheaper than the azera -  never mind something like the genesis.	1
	the taurus is also lighter by at least 100 lbs, is a bigger car than the genesis (interior and trunk volumes) , and offers slightly better fe while still outaccelerating the gen 3.8. while it appears that the '10 taurus will get up near $40 large (msrp) keep in mind that is with the 350+ hp blown ecoboost v6, again cheaper and more economical than the gen v8.	1
	the 2010 taurus appears to be more of the styling update that it needed so badly as opposed to anything earth shattering from a mechanical perspective - from a simple spec sheet comparison, it does appear that those power and styling upgrades will make it more enough to be a logical alternative that should be cheaper as well - given that ford products have been known to be discounted even more heavily lately than even the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5246#msg5246re: rented a 30k 2009 impala / no comparison to genesis [captain2]        which taurus is lighter, and lighter than what???	1
	captain my dear friend, the '09 taurus (fwd) has a curb weight of 3741 lbs (the '10 has a curb weight of 4015 lbs.).	1
	throw in awd and the weight goes up and fuel economy takes a slight dip as well.	1
	the genesis 3.8 has a curb weight of 3748 lbs.	1
	please tell me what math you used to come up with a 100 lbs.	1
	difference?	1
	as far as intererior space, the taurus can pull that off because it's not as padded inside as the genesis is, but yes...the taurus is truly cavernous inside.	1
	fuel economy between the two is pretty much dead even.	1
	as far as pricing goes, the 2010 taurus sho with the 365 hp under the hood will be going for closer to $45k when you get done putting in the extra goodies you want.	1
	please explain how that is cheaper than $42k for a fully loaded genesis 4.6 w/tech package???	1
	pulled from the inside line's test between the sho and the g37 coupe:                  the base price of the all-wheel-drive 2010 ford taurus sho is $37,995.	1
	our test car carried $7,480 in options for an as-tested total of $45,475.	1
	gulp.	1
	going with the numbers, the taurus will hardly out-accelerate a genesis.	1
	the taurus reaches max hp at 6251 rpm and max torque at 4501 rpm, while the genesis reaches max hp at 6000 rpm and max torque at 3500 rpm.	1
	there's a reason why the '09 taurus is selling cheaper than even azeras...                                not quite sure what you mean by the '10 taurus being a show car.	1
	if any taurus is still a show car, it's the sho model.       	1

	don't get me wrong ... i think the avalon is a great, comfortable sedan and it will probably last forever without serious issues.	1
	it definitely does not transmit every bump like the genesis does.	1
	in my previous posts, i have talked about the fact that i can't tell a lot of difference in real-world driving performance between the v6 and v8 genesis models.	1
	i was hell bent on getting a v8 but went ahead with the v6 before the eight was available.	1
	when the first v8 arrived, the dealer wanted me to drive it.	1
	at very high speeds, the eight starts pulling away from the v6.	1
	in normal but spirited driving, the six is amazingly close!	1
	i crawled out of the v8 and decided that i was more than happy with my six banger.	1
	if you knew how many performace oriented cars i have owned, you would know how significant that was!	1
	incidentally, i have been posting an update every 5,000 miles or so.	1
	my last post was at 25k and i am now at 28k.	1
	unless something unexpected happens, my next post will be focused on my search for the best replacement tires.	1
	although i still had about 10,000 miles of tread remaining, i ruined one tire and decided to go ahead and replace all four.	1
	i wound up trying one brand but am now switching to a different brand for reasons that i will explain in my next update a few weeks from now.	1
	i am curious to know if any of you other owners have stacked up this many miles and how similar your experience has been to mine.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5253#msg5253re: august automobile magazine [colegar]        i am hoping the 3.8 litre v6 will be pumped to over 300 horsepower for the 2011 model year (if hyundai decides on some mid-cycle changes).	1
	some manufacturers are getting more horsepower from similiar displacement motors - nissan/infiniti for example is getting 330 hp from their 3.7 litre normally aspirated engines.	1
	the genesis is a good car as is, but if they could bump the power a little on the v6 and tweak the suspension it could be an excellent car.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5254#msg5254re: august automobile magazine [bman900]        you do those two things, then the rubber will really fly with the comparisons with the 5-series/e-class sedans!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5255#msg5255re: august automobile magazine [bman900]        a power bump is a real possibility.	1
	substantial rumor and talk has the 2010 santa fe getting an improved lambda ii v6.	1
	it will be going from 3.3 ltr to 3.5 ltr and will get direct injection giving it more power and about a 10% bump in mileage.	1
	can't imagine the engines in the genesis won't get the same treatment.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5256#msg5256power bump?!?!?!	1
	god i hope not!	1
	while engineering does continually evolve, it seems every time that a manufacturer starts chasing the high-output hp, fuel economy suffers big time.	1
	i'd much prefer around 265hp with better mpg.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5257#msg5257re: power bump?!?!?!	1
	[poodog13]        i am with you on that, but i don't think most buyers of this class of car are.	1
	more power is usually seen as a good thing.	1
	but hyundai is on a tear to improve both power and fe across its lineup, using new/improved engine technology, so maybe they will do that with the genesis.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5258#msg5258re: power bump?!?!?!	1
	[backy]        with today's technology, you can have both power and economy.	1
	the infinity g's v6, which has 40 more hp than the genesis (with about the same size engine) gets the same overall mileage according to consumer reports.	1
	(both are rated at 21 mpg in overall driving).	1
	hyundai should have the technology to bump up the v6.... the tau 4.6 liter v8 produces 80 hp/litre (368 total), so using that formula they should be able to bring the 3.8 engine up to 304 hp.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5259#msg5259re: power bump?!?!?!	1
	[bman900]        they do have it.	1
	wait for it... wait for it...                                i agree with the earlier post though re why not use this technology to improve fe even more by keeping the output down?	1
	surely there is a trade-off for power vs. fe at some point.	1
	it begs the question as to whether hyundai would ever go the hybrid route with the genesis v6 sedan, using the lithium polymer batteries and other technologies they are developing for the sonata et.	1
	al.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5260#msg5260re: power bump?!?!?!	1
	[backy]        there's no special technology (short of direct injection, maybe) to get more hp or fuel economy out of an engine.	1
	the infiniti 3.7l engine makes more hp than the hyundai 3.8l simply because it has peakier power delivery and a higher redline.	1
	the genesis engine is designed to be smooth and deliver nice power lower in the rpm range.	1
	the g37 needs 7000 rpm to deliver 330hp, and it's no smooth operator at that speed.	1
	hyundai could easily tweak the air/fuel ratios and cam/valve timing to bump the peak hp a few points.	1
	but, just like every other manufacturer, they'd just be robbing peter to pay paul.       	1

	i just don't get that from the hyundai.	1
	toyota's 3.5 is the probably the best v6 out there (especially in direct injected form).	1
	as for the transmission in the genesis, its made by toyota anyway.	1
	it suffers from the same crazy shift logic that is geared more toward fuel economy than anything else.       	1

	i'm not a great fan of hybrids, not in their present form.	1

	a 5 or 6 cylinder turbo diesel would be plenty motivation for the genesis, and would easily outlast the 10/100 warranty.	1
	i highly doubt a hybrid's expensive, consumable batteries and electronics could be covered by the 10/100.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5264#msg5264re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        it is strange how differently we compare the two engines (toyota 3.5 vs. genesis 3.8).	1
	i find the genesis to be much stronger without having to drop down a gear at highway speeds when negotiation curves and long grades.	1
	when it does need a lower gear, i think it does so almost seamlessly.	1
	i don't know how much driving you have done with the genesis in the mountains, but that is where it really shows its stuff.	1
	the 16 lb.-ft. torque advantage it has over the toyota 3.5, and the fact that it is available at lower rpm's, seems obvious to me.	1
	some of the magazine road tests have reported the genesis 3.8's zero to sixty time at six seconds flat (hyundai advertises 6.2 seconds).	1
	that is really hauling for a 3,750 pound car!	1
	i agree that the genesis ecm computer is tuned for mileage during easy, low-speed takeoffs from stoplights, etc.and it tends to shift at very low rpm's.	1
	i would prefer it to be a little less anxious to reach third gear for economy's sake.	1
	once it reaches third gear, i like the shift pattern from there on.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5265#msg5265re: august automobile magazine [colegar]        it's amazing to me how folks perceive the toyota 3.5 to be better than the hyundai 3.8, but the 3.8 reaches max torque and hp at lower rpms than the 3.5.  honestly, i think it has more to do with gearing than anything else.	1
	i've driven toyotas and acceleration in them is very 'spirited', but like it was said before...at higher speeds, the engine is a bit 'fussy'.	1
	acceleration with the 3.8 is truly butter smooth.	1
	it doesn't snap your head back when you take off, but if you're not paying attention, you'll look down and realize you're doing 80 mph before you know it.	1
	the 3.8 in my azera doesn't even breath hard when pushed and the 3.8 in the genesis is even better.	1
	if you want better shifting for more spirited driving, put it in manual mode and have a blast!!	1

	imo the 3.8 is behind the times... heck yota can get over 300 with their 3.5 and nissan is getting 330 from the 3.7.  sorry, i'll never agree the 3.8 is a better engine than toyota's 2gr, from a refinement standpoint anyway.	1
	oh and another slightly off topic thing about the 3.8 in my genesis.... sounds like a freight train on startup.	1

	in day to day driving i notice nothing at all better in the powertrain from my '06 avalon.	1
	the six speed shifts very similar to the 5 speed (same logic i would assume) and on the highway neither car had to downshift to speed up a little.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5268#msg5268re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]         shouldn't it... being a higher displacement?	1
	don't know...look at the numbers for the nissan 3.7.  it's a higher displacement than the 3.5, but lower than the 3.8 and it requires 7000 rpm for max hp and 5200 rpm for max torque.	1
	there goes your theory...way out the window!!!	1
	the 3.7 has higher numbers than toyota's 3.5.                                don't even know why folks are trying to compare the toyota 3.5 to the nissan 3.7 when nissan employs the 3.5 in the maxima.	1
	i mean...folks want to compare the avalon to the g37, but the better comparison would be the maxima.	1
	anyway...you don't have to agree about which is the better engine.	1
	however, you simply can't ignore that the 3.8 is pulling around a slightly heavier car, pushing more hp, reaches max hp  torque at lower rpms and the difference in overall fuel economy is only 2 mpg ...it would seem the 3.8 is the more refined engine.	1
	folks just want to knock it because it doesn't snap your head back when you mash the gas pedal.	1
	i think programming has more to do with that than the power of the engine.	1
	290 hp with 263 ft/lbs of torque is indeed more than enough to snap ones head back.	1
	how do i know...the 200 hp in-line 6 that was in my 86.5 supra was able to snap your head back on hard take-offs.	1
	as far as the start up issue...don't know what to say about that.	1
	they must've done something different between the 3.8 in the azreas and the 3.8 in the genesis because i certainly don't have that issue with my azera.	1
	start ups are smooth and quiet.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5269#msg5269re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         there goes your theory...way out the window!!!	1
	i'm no engine designer or claim to be... the only thing i know is that a larger displacement engine all things being equal                 should                put out more power and tourque especially at lower rpm's.	1
	however, there is more to it than the scope of this forum thats for sure.	1
	i mean...folks want to compare the avalon to the g37, but the better comparison would be the maxima.	1
	i was comparing engines only not the cars themselves.	1
	if toyota had put the direct injected 3.5 into the avalon i probably wouldn't be driving a genesis.	1
	they must've done something different between the 3.8 in the azreas and the 3.8 in the genesis                                something has to be different, it makes slightly more power in the genesis.	1
	of course the power bump is so slight it could just be a different intake manifold or something.       	1

	however, everyone knows...more power doesn't always mean the faster car.	1
	like i said before, some of the driving experience is attributed to the gearing of the transmission.	1
	i was comparing engines only not the cars themselves.	1
	if toyota had put the direct injected 3.5 into the avalon i probably wouldn't be driving a genesis.	1
	actually, depending on the application you do have to talk about the cars because the usage of the toyota 3.5 in the avalon isn't the same as the 3.5 in the es350...notice the bump up in hp from 268 to 272 and the slight decrease in overall fuel economy?	1
	we won't even talk about the fact that the es is almost 170 lbs lighter than the genesis, but stepping to the 3.5 being used in the gs350...it's toting around a heavier car, slightly more hp than the genesis, but the overall fuel economy is about the same.	1
	only difference here is di and the 6-speed tranny.	1
	if toyota employed the same usage in the avalon, do you really thing folks would want to buy the es or gs350???	1
	so once again, mechanically speaking...the avalon better compares with the maxima  azera.	1
	as far as my comment in something being different between the two 3.8's, it was meant more towards the design aspect of it.	1
	they did something different in how the oil is maintained in the engine as the azera doesn't have that dry start issue that the genesis has.	1
	i wasn't referring the power bump...it would take more than an intake manifold to bump the hp up 27 hp.       	1

	actually the only difference between the av and es is that the es requires premium fuel.	1
	the avalon doesn',t but suggests that 'for enhanced performance' to use premuim fuel.	1
	that is what makes for the slight bump in hp.	1
	now if your talking the is350 that is the direct injected version.	1
	they did something different in how the oil is maintained in the engine                                i think you may be right.	1

	is the oil filter on top of the engine in the azera?	1
	yes...absolutely.	1
	you simply remove the engine shroud (6 bolts) and the oil filter cannister is right there for an easy change.       	1

	all contribute a little bit to noise during startup.	1
	haven't looked at under hood insulation, maybe it should be thicker.	1
	using 5w20 oil also contributes a little to a noisy cold startup.	1
	there was a discussion on your link about the oil filter draining back into the engine.	1
	i believe there is supposed to be an anti-drain back valve in the oil filter element.	1

	the longer the piston stroke and/or the more reciprocating mass - the greater the troque and the more likely it is available as lower rpms.	1
	thus the reason why engines like the antiquated old gm 3.8 is a  torque monster relative to its seroius lack of hp, and also the reason why larger engines tend to have higher torque available at lower relative rpms..                there are but a few 'state of the art' 6s out there and the hyundai 3.8- while a decent effort - is not among them.	1
	'state of the art' being defined as continuously variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust sides as well as being fitted with at least the capability to accomodate direct injection.	1
	tbmk the hyundai v6 has a more rudimentary 'cam shift' valve timing on the intake side only - similar to what is on the ford dt, for example.	1
	'old' technlogy.	1
	state of the art 6s?	1
	- the toyota 2gr, the latest iterations of the nissan vq, the mb 3.5, and of course the bmw straight 6s.	1
	worthy of mention as well, the vw narrow v6 and the gm hf 3.6. actually puts the hyundai engine a bit far down the list, doesn't it?	1
	from my  observation, the toyota 2gr in my own avalon is definitively in a different class than anything available from any manufacturer excepting possibly one or two of those german engines.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5276#msg5276re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         well...that actually makes it worse.	1
	you benefit from a few more ponies under the hood with premium fuel, but you take a hit in fuel economy                                i don't know why the hwy mpg # for the es is 1 mpg less than the avalon, they weigh essentially the same, use the same engine and trans.	1
	i will say this i couldn't tell the 4 hp difference when i ran premium in my avalon.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5277#msg5277re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]         the toyota 3.5 in the avalon isn't the same as the 3.5 in the es350...notice the bump up in hp from 268 to 272                wrongo - the engines are identical - the lexus rating is for the premium gas 'required' , the avalon is rated for regular gas.	1
	you might be interested to know that the 2gr-fs (non direct injected) was originally rated at 280 hp in 2005 when it came out - new sae standards that included some changes in testing methods (gas octanes recommended, accessory loads etc) caused the engine to be rerated in 06 to the 268 that it is today.	1
	the engine, however, never changed and nor was it changed as it was later installed in the es.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5278#msg5278re: august automobile magazine [captain2]        thanks captain, that was already pointed out.	1
	that 280 hp rating was based on what toyota wanted to put out there.	1
	as you can see, it was brought down to reality when the sae standards went into affect.	1
	so...in all honesty, the 2gr was never really 280 hp.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5279#msg5279re: august automobile magazine [tjc78]        although hps (as well as fes) tend to sell a lot of cars - i would submit to you that there are very, very few folks out there that could 'feel' a 4 hp difference out of a possible 270. even on the dragstrip, in the hands of a professional, i would bet that there is more likely a greater test variance from car to car, than that same tester, would be able to find with performance results because of the lousy 4 hp - all else equal, of course.	1
	i have never been able to tell any difference in either the fe or power in my av either, and my manual does say 'premium fuel recommended for max performance'.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5280#msg5280re: august automobile magazine [captain2]        all that and the hyundai 3.8 manages to be right behind that extraordinary 2gr you just love so much.	1
	hmmmmmmmmmmmm....i would say it's better than a decent effort and better than you you are willing to admit.	1
	please, don't get me wrong...i've never said the 3.8 offered head turning technology, but for it be one of hyundai's newest engines based off the 3.8 that i have in my azera...that's a pretty darn good effort.	1

	!        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5281#msg5281re: august automobile magazine [allmet33]        that 280 hp rating was based on what toyota wanted to put out there                                toyota misrepresented nothing - they simply tested theitr engines to the testing rules in effect at the time, and that is what the engine earned.	1
	honda/acura as well as nissan all derated when the standards were changed - look it up.	1
	it's really not that important,  but people in glass houses.....                bet you don't want to go back about 10 years or so and talk about all the folks ready to sue hyundai for misstating all their hp ratings on all their sorry arss engines they made at the time - or do you?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5282#msg5282re: august automobile magazine [captain2]        yeah...we can go back to that and it was only 7 years ago because it happend on the 2002 model year.	1
	i was one of those that enjoyed an even more extended warranty (12yr/120k mile) because of that fiasco.	1
	i mean...10 hp wasn't a big deal, but a technicality is a technicality.	1
	the problem is...hyundai was going by the standards in effect now and then tried to employ the same standards as toyota, honda and nissan and it back fired on them!	1
	oh well, what to do...make a better engine and call it a day.	1
	hyundai not making engines of significance...i wonder why in the world prestigous mercedes benz would want to get involved with poor lil hyundai in developing a 3 cylinder engine to be used in a new vehicle by mb.	1
	i mean...toyota being so cutting edge would seem like a lock for something like that.	1

	no.	1

	imagine what the 2gr would do if they made as a 3.8 -                 starti at 310 hp maybe                  .	1
	the 3.8 is                 only                decent in that there are a number of engines that surpass it in terms of technology, refinement, and specific power output (hpa and/or torque per unit volume) , primarily those normally aspirated engines that i specifically noted.	1
	yes, when hyundai gets around to improving the valvetrain control (and eventually they should have to) the sky indeed is the limit - but for now, there simply is no comparison between the 3.8 and a number of the competitor's v6s out there.	1
	not just toyota's.	1
	if the genesis is such a superior effort (as i would be inclined to agree it is) then doesn't it deserve an engine that is something more than 'midpack' engine?	1
	btw simply push that 2gr hard and then do the same in your azera, and you should easily hear, feel, and otherwise understand the difference.       	1

	you sound like me now!	1
	i am glad i'm not the only one who feels this way.	1
	the difference between my avalon and my genesis is night and day in terms of the performance of the engine.       	1

	back in the day, bigger usually meant better, but in today's world...we all know that's not the case.	1
	look at the lancer evo or the subaru wrx.	1
	however, on the flip side of that...the bugatti veyron, but that's an example of paying for the bigger is better theory.	1
	okay...it really depends on whether or not it's direct injection or not.	1
	the 3.7 in the infiniti is smaller than the 3.8 and it's producing 40 hp more.	1
	the 3.5 in the lexus gs is putting out 303 hp and it's smaller than the 3.8.                                give hyundai a chance to get the whole package right my friend.	1
	the genesis is their first foray into the luxury segment.	1
	to be quite honest...for their first attempt, i think they did a better job than toyota did when they rolled out the first lexus ls 400.                                not sure what you mean by pushing the 3.8 hard and you'll notice a difference.	1
	i have pushed the 3.8 in my azera hard, taking it up close to the 140 mph mark and the engine wasn't even whining.	1
	i can only imagine that the genesis would be even better being pushed as it's the the rwd advantage.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5287#msg5287re: august automobile magazine [bobad]        sure we can talk about sludge - in 3 liter and 3.3 liter engines that toyota has since discontinued - years ago - a problem with several mfgrs.and a situation that toyota handled particularily badly.	1
	(yes, even toyota's ---- can stink)                allmet's inference in  his orig post  was that toyota overstated the 2gr's hp as part of some nefarious scheme to defraud customers - an absurd contention.	1
	hyundai did defraud its customers not all that long ago by intentionally overstating their power numbers ostensibly so they could sell more cars - and did pay millions restitution.	1

	that is actually one incident that came and went with minor fanfare.	1
	my inference wasn't that they intentionally mis-stated hp ratings...they had their own rating system that gave them higher than realistic numbers.	1
	when a universal system was employed...that made it evident.	1
	sorta like the auto electonics industry employing a universal system for stating output wattages of components (cea-2006) since some companies had their own system for calculating outputs.	1
	toyota wasn't using some underhanded scheme to dupe the public..as long as they were going by their calculations, they were putting out what they felt to be correct.	1
	funny how a system is put in place that's not theirs and all the sudden, the numbers drop 12 hp.	1
	hey...it is what it is, but now the playing field is leveled in terms of how hp is to be calculated...everyone's using the same method and formula.	1
	folks can talk about before that, but please do so with the reality that toyota and honda shared the same rough beginnings.	1

	its' one glaring fault is that it just happens to be butt-ugly while the genesis is one of the best looking cars around.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5300#msg5300re: where's the diesel???	1
	[bobad]        given that the experience with such batteries has been very good in hybrids to date, e.g.	1
	prius which dates back nearly 10 years, with very few replacements needed, i think your pessimism is unfounded.	1
	anyway, the warranty is at least 8 years and as i said, is 10 years in the cafe states.	1
	so if the battery does not last at least 8 or 10 years, depending on where you live, you get a free battery.	1

	that is exactly what hyundai is on the verge of doing.	1
	by continually improving the overall quality, benchmark for standard equipment, and access to higher-level options within the 'middle' segment (as opposed to economy or full-luxury), hyundai        will        redefine this segment.	1
	and while they are at it, they will influence the entry-level luxury segment in ways that mb, bmw, and lexus fanatics will bemoan for years to come.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5310#msg5310re: august automobile magazine [poodog13]         that is exactly what hyundai is on the verge of doing.	1
	the problem i still see is the brand name - the genesis may be good enough (the jury's still out) that it may gain some sort of acceptance to those that might ordinarily consider something like a ls but even if that happens isn't redefining 'hyundai' something entirely different?	1
	one on the reasons that the lexus gained such immediate acceptance and success was because they could distance it from the more mundane 'toyotas'  (new name and new dealers) and because that association (lexus = toyota) was definitely an asset at the time.	1
	so let's assume for a moment that the genesis is every bit as much 'car' as the '89 ls ( a big stretch imo) .	1
	what then happens to the other 2/3 of that success equation?	1
	don't believe that hyundai- on the basis of improving their products only over the last 5 years or so- has anywhere near the market positiion (and quality perception) that toyota did 20 years ago.	1
	which is the rub....       	1

	it's not 1980 any more captain.	1
	people are accepting of asian brand names, and people are more pragmatic about their purchases.	1
	smart people don't care a bit about 1990's quality if today's quality is great.	1
	quality is not genetic.	1
	thinking people know that today's fine hyundai products are not tainted by products of 20 years ago.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5312#msg5312re: august automobile magazine [bobad]         it's not 1980 any more captain                no, it sure is'nt  - but it is a whole lot closer to                 1995                than perhaps you would care to admit.	1
	it is hyundai's products of the mid 80s (and well into the 90s )that has given 'korean'  cars its bad rep - you are way way too early with '1980'.	1
	whether you'd like to concede the point or not, there does remain a significant number of carbuyers  out there that have a helluva a problem spending even 20 large on a korean made vehicle - never mind 40.                you do make a good point though that 'thinking' people learn to look past a label, certainly true, i guess until that person does enough 'thinking' to understand that there are a number of 'more expensive' choices that are actually cheaper.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5313#msg5313re: august automobile magazine [captain2]        as a matter of fact i am considering just such a tradeoff.	1
	it doesn't involve the genesis, but it does involve choosing between a well equipped, very impressive vehicle of korean origin and a less well equipped, somewhat less luxurious, somewhat sportier japanese competitor.	1
	in my case, the initial cost advantage of the korean vehicle will be offset by lower cost of scheduled maintenance and fuel on the japanese one, making the cost question largely irrelevant.	1
	so the question becomes:                 ignoring cost,                which vehicle is most appealing?	1
	and it's there that perceived quality (including but not limited to perceived mechanical and/or electrical reliability) enters the equation.	1
	would i 'feel better' with a more established brand?	1
	this isn't about ego, so much as it's about the idea that the car is an 'investment.'	1
	a depreciating investment, almost by definition, but an 'investment' nonetheless.	1
	in that sense, then, the purchase of the korean brand becomes a decision that is                 perceived                to be riskier.	1
	this, in turn, leads to lower resale value.	1
	but, you insist, 'i always keep my cars for at least 100k miles, so resale value does not matter to me.'	1
	well, fine, unless some idiot runs a traffic light and  totals your one year old genesis.	1
	then resale value matters to you, and your insurance company, and your bank too.       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5316#msg5316re: august automobile magazine [stephen987]         in my case, the initial cost advantage of the korean vehicle will be offset by lower cost of scheduled maintenance and fuel on the japanese one, making the cost question largely irrelevant.	1
	can't imagine that'll it should cost any more ( and maybe even less) to have a korean car serviced than the japanese one - and further if it becomes a covered warranty issue the korean car would have the advantage there as well.	1
	in terms of unscheduled maintanence, while the japanese models do show slightly better reliability stats, these things happen less than they used to - even to korean cars.	1
	heck, if you have enough faith that our tax money is being well spent, you might even look at a d3 car - they might even be cheaper to buy than a hyundai right now.	1
	where the japanese cars do have an advantage, is in residual values and not so much in maintenance or repair costs.	1
	.	1
	if you are really going to keep your car for 100k or more, i would tell you that initial purchase price as well as satisfying; what you like are easily the top 2 considerations.	1
	ps automobiles are awfully difficult to defend as 'investments' unless of course you want to use adjectives like bad and worse.        	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5319#msg5319re: august automobile magazine [stephen987]        i think so too, when the gap insurance isn't included in the loan or lease.	1
	but then,  i wasn't the one posting on the risk of getting a year-old genesis totalled and not being able to cover the amount owed to the bank.	1
	that is exactly the situation gap insurance is designed to address.       	1

	but that's not relevant to the genesis discussion.	1
	.	1
	.	1
	since 2006, hyundai has been using timing chains instead of belts (at least on their v-6 engines).	1
	another reason i upgraded from my '02 sonata (which had a belt) to my '06 azera.	1
	to be honest, it's hard to say which is less expensive to service between korean  japanese cars.	1
	i mean...if you're talking lexus, acura  infiniti...it could get pricey.	1
	but servicing prices between toyota, honda, nissan  hyundai are pretty close.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5321#msg5321re: august automobile magazine [backy]        i learned my lesson on gap insurance when my '96 camry was totalled and i still owed $3000 on it.	1
	also, if you buy a car and purchase gap insurance and you get rid of the car before you've paid it off...you get money back on that gap insurance as well.	1
	that was the case when we sold our '07 outlook.	1
	insurance, while it can be the countries largest scam, it's a comfort to know you've got it (with a reputable company) and even nicer when you don't have to use it.	1
	too bad you don't get much in return for not using it though.        	1

	the lower trim + door opening have dark brown so seemed like it should have dark brown mats to go with it.	1
	anyway, dealer originally put in black mats - which they told me was the only color available.	1
	after looking at some on-line parts websites, readily found that dark brown is an option.	1
	i was able to convince the dealer that they were, they've ordered them and they are now in.	1
	i think it is these 'little things' that impact the overall customer experience and where there is room for improvement.	1
	rather than dismiss my inquiry (the easy way out) - why not dig deeper and resolve vs. sending me off to do it.	1
	not a biggie, just a little frustrating.	1
	beyond that, i'm extremely happy with the car.	1
	we shopped for a couple of months and kept circling back to the genesis.	1

	i was actually 'signing on the line' away from getting an m35x which would i'm sure would have been a good choice as well.	1

	this is for                 most recent                models.	1
	even mercedes-benz, vw and bmw scored better - and cr does not like them.	1
	pages 90 and 91 indicate some pretty serious issues in cars made before last couple of years.	1
	also, entourage, vera cruz and azera rate average for new cars, and that is not good.	1
	actually, the cr sample pool is so low and non-representative of the total auto owning population that it is not reliable itself.	1
	i know because i sent in a glowing survey on the 07 azera and it went from below average in april 08 issue to much better than average in april 09 issue.	1
	in the end what really matters is the perception of the general public and i agree that is getting better and better for hyundai.	1
	but the question is does hyundai rank in the very top ranks now?	1
	not yet, but in a few years maybe.	1
	personally i worry that their rush to get out new models distracts them from refining the existing models and insuring reliability over the long term.	1

	in the aspirational luxury car category, the hyundai genesis beat out top rivals including the audi a5 and a4, volvo xc70 and cadillac cts, while the hyundai elantra topped the ford focus, mazda3 and kia spectra in the compact car segment.	1
	additionally, the hyundai sonata finished second in the premium mid-size car segment.	1
	autopacific's fourth annual ideal vehicle awards (iva) rank auto manufacturers for how closely their 2009 model-year cars or trucks came to matching owners' expectations and criteria.	1
	to determine the winners, autopacific asked owners to rate their new car or truck on how close it came to 'ideal' in 15 different categories ranging from power and acceleration to safety features and storage.	1
	the vehicles that customers said they would change the least were considered the most 'ideal.'	1
	'hyundai has created two vehicles that owners say are nearly perfect just the way they are: their ideal vehicle,' said george peterson, president, autopacific.	1
	'owners of the genesis and elantra indicated through autopacific's survey that they are driving a vehicle that meets their expectations, meaning they desire little to no change to their vehicle.'	1
	'having our models recognized for autopacific's 2009 ideal vehicle awards is a testament to the hard work and dedication that goes into all the vehicles in the hyundai lineup,' said scott margason, director of product and strategic planning, hyundai motor america.	1
	'at hyundai, we strive to exceed customer expectations in safety, quality and performance and look forward to continuing to develop more award winning vehicles.'	1
	hyundai's genesis sedan sets a new benchmark in the premium car category.	1
	with a starting price of just $33,000, genesis includes performance and luxury features typically found on vehicles costing thousands of dollars more.	1
	the hyundai elantra has unsurpassed standard safety in the compact segment and is equipped with six standard airbags.	1
	elantra includes many extras like standard audio auxiliary input jack - all at an affordable price point any customer will appreciate.	1
	autopacific                                autopacific is a future-oriented automotive marketing and product-consulting firm.	1
	every year it publishes a wide variety of syndicated studies for the automotive industry.	1
	the firm also conducts extensive proprietary research and consulting for auto manufacturers, distributors, marketers and suppliers worldwide.	1

	i have spent much more than $240 on my '08 mitsubishi lancer so far, i don't have a total for ya, but there's been several routine maintenance stops, including $814 for new p215/45r18 pirelli tires at the lancer's 30,000-mile mark in december of 2008. i bought my lancer gts new in march of 2007 and am around the 40,910 mile mark as i type this out here.	1
	probably spent around $1,500 so far, which includes the new pirelli p-zero nero m+s pinna's.	1
	which i luv to the max, btw.	1
	i have found my tires to love.	1

	regardless, backy please carefully read the ap[ril 08 and april 09 issues of cr and note that they changed model listings, e.g.	1
	xg and azera are separate in 08, but lumped together in 09.   hyundai is improving, but still has a few skeltons in its closet.	1
	notice number of black spots and changes in ratings.	1
	also, mb e350 went from worse than average in 08 to average and recommended in 09 - one year?	1
	cr has information, but needs to be taken with a grain of salt.	1
	in 08, 07 azera was much worse than average and a used car to avoid, but in 09 it was rated much above average.	1
	amazing what my one over-inflated survey reply apparently accomplished.	1
	cr's sample is too small and non-representative.	1
	also, don't forget many subscribers are businesses, institutions, librarys, etc.	1
	that never submit surveys.	1
	regardless, the genesis is a fantastically equipped and priced vehicle and has been well received by many, but                 not                all.	1
	the azera was better received in 2006 and its sales are dismal and resale value has plummeted.	1
	also, problems surfaced in too many of them - and hyundai acknowledged them.	1
	will genesis do better?	1
	let's keep our fingers crossed because i would like to have one.	1
	but not before there is less controversy over the suspension and it proves itself - and hyundai supports it better than they have the azera, vera cruz and some others.	1
	btw, i will be taking a hiatus from this and other sites.	1
	car space in particular as it seems to have way too much back and forth between the same individuals discussing the same things ad infinitum or attacking those that question the exalted hyundai models.	1

	my biggest concern with hyundai is not the problems that some azera and yes genesis                owners are experincing, but hyundais' attitude about correcting those problems.	1
	we always hear: '                 that is normal                ' or '                 it is driving as it was designed.                '	1
	both bob and myself and a many others are on our third set of factory shocks.	1
	all have failed and hyundai refuses to correct these part failures, pretending to hide behind those stupid excuses.	1
	if there were no shock problems, why did hyundai replace those original shocks with the tsb parts?	1
	and why did hyundai replace those replacement shocks with the latest parts?	1
	all in all, three sets, all with different part numbers and all have failed because of  poor quality.	1
	mando                cannot produce a quality product which will last more than a few hundred miles.	1
	no one makes or offers an aftermarket replacement shock!	1
	hyundai will not have a 2010 model azera so there is no need to correct or attempt to                fix any suspension problems with the azera.	1
	lets bring out another model and make                the genesis the next to the top of the line and promote the new equus instead.	1
	because some people bought early azeras (06s) and were lucky and                have  experinced no problems is a fortunate thing for them.	1
	please do not attach those of us who have and are still experincing                problems with these later azeras' and their inferior shocks.	1
	before i bought the azera, we rented a v6 sonata for a weekend and put 1000 miles                on that rental car over all types of roads and at all speeds, and it was a fine car.	1
	based on that, i thought the azera would be the same, but alas, that was not the case.	1
	btw, there are many who are not happy with their genesis ride and handling.	1
	many magazines have spoken of the genesis' shortcomings regarding this.	1
	for a comparison, you do not and will not hear anyone who tests a late '3' '5' or '7'                series bmw or an e or s class mercedes complain about their ride and handling.	1
	why do you think that is?	1
	good luck with your genesis.	1
	let's hope that your                 sachs                shocks are better than the                 mandos                on the azeras.       	1

	everything i have read and seen indicates that although it won't be launched until next summer, there will be a 2010 azera (could be a 2011 model by then).	1
	it will be based on an updated chassis/body and will provide the basis for the new kia amanti also.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5356#msg5356re: august automobile magazine [carolinabob]        there was no azera in 2004.  the azera has nothing to do with the discussion on reliability of hyundais after five years, which was the thread you jumped into.	1
	also, azera is a different design than the genesis, with the exception of the 3.8 which has been tweaked for the genesis.	1
	have fun on your hiatus.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5357#msg5357tire replacement (genesis 3.8 with tech pack)        in a previous post, i mentioned that my tires were still good and that they would not need to be replaced until at least 35,000 miles.	1
	however, since i ran over something that ruined one of them, and since i did not want one new tire paired up with three worn tires, i decided to replace the original dunlaps now.	1
	i did as much research as possible and found a fantastic price of $120 each (after a mail-in rebate) for pirelli pzero nero ms.  i have never been a fan of pirellis but this particular tire has received excellent reviews for tread life, quietness and handling.	1
	i decided to give them a try.	1
	i found them to be pretty good from a handling standpoint, and they were very quite.	1
	they also improved the rigid ride that i and many others of you have complained about.	1
	however, at 80 mph on the interstate, they transmitted a slight vibration that would not go away even after the tire shop rebalanced them three times and actually replacing two of the four in an effort to find a more 'round' tire.	1
	as anal as i am about tires having to be completely vibration free, i was disappointed, especially since i really liked the ride improvement of the pirellis.	1
	the tire dealer took me out to the balancing machine to let me observe the reason for the less-than-perfect ride characteristics.	1
	each of the pirellis had a slight amount of what he called 'movement' and that i would call 'out-of-round'.	1
	he offered to let me switch to a set of michelin pilot sport as plus, which he all but guaranteed to be flawless.	1
	he told me that if i were driving a typical american-made car, or a camry, honda, etc., i would never have noticed the slight 'movement' in the pirellis because those cars' suspension tolerances and engineering are not as sensitive as a bmw, mercedes, or, yes ... a genesis.	1
	he charged me the price difference between the two brands, which set me back approximately an additional $259 but he did not charge for mounting and balancing.	1
	i have put about 1,000 miles on the michelins and he was correct in that they are absolutely vibration-free at any speed.	1
	they are also outstanding from a handling standpoint.	1
	however, i almost wish i had lived with the less-than-perfect pirellis because the michelins tend to exacerbate the much too-stiff ride that the genesis inherently has (no matter if some bloggers refuse to admit it).	1
	i am going to stick with the michelins for two reasons.	1
	first, anytime i am on good smooth roads, they are perfect!	1
	secondly, the tire dealer has bent over backwards to make me happy and i don't have the heart to go back with a different complaint.	1
	its not his fault that hyundai missed the mark in setting up the suspension!	1
	if anyone from pirelli happens to read this, i think the pzero neros are great tires if you guys can just make them round!	1
	at 30,000 miles, i will give my regular owner-experience update that i have posted at 5,000 mile intervals since i bought the genesis last august.	1
	if i am not the mileage king among us, i am close to it.	1
	unless something changes between now and then, get ready to read that it is a fantastic car except for the overly harsh transmission of bumps in the road.	1
	anybody want to take my bet that hyundai will make some suspensions corrections for upcoming model years?       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5361#msg5361re: tire replacement (genesis 3.8 with tech pack) [colegar]        not all michelins are created equal.	1
	there is as much difference from one michelin to the next as night is from day.	1
	try the energy tire.	1
	very quiet.	1
	very soft.	1
	not that great in the rain but decent tread wear.	1
	all those little numbers and letters on the side of the tire actually mean something with regard to speed rating, stiffness, performance in rain ect.	1
	it also makes a difference where you buy the tire.	1
	i did some work for firestone once upon a time and the highest quality tire with the tightest specifications was sold to the auto industry, ie.	1
	the tires that come on your new car.	1
	the next lower quality tire(with the exact same name brand specs ect) was sold to the firestone retailer.	1
	the next lower category went to the discount retailer like what used to be called otasco and another large retailer i won't name.	1
	the lowest quality tire with the most forgiving specifications had the name changed to another 'off brand.'	1
	the category under this wound up in the back of the plant and was sold as scrap deeme        d unsafe to be put on a car.	1
	it looks like some people in this forum seem to think the gensis is actually a lexus that didn't make the grade and was rebranded a hyundai.	1
	i disagree and think that lexus and infinity just heard roy orbison sing a song called 'blew by you.'	1

	i prefer not to mention the tire dealer by name because i don't know if they would want pirelli to know that they actually showed me the so called 'movement' that apparently was causing the vibration at 80 mph.	1
	i will tell you that they are a major tire dealer with probably a hundred or more locations.	1
	i would really be surprised if they are not getting first-line tires from the major tire brands!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5363#msg5363re: tire replacement (genesis 3.8 with tech pack) [colegar]        i've had pirelli p zero nero m+s tires on my bmw for 2 years now and couldn't be happier with them.	1
	i wholeheartedly recommend them.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5364#msg5364re: new genesis [alonzo2]        the navigation dial controls how much you zoom in and out on the map.	1
	so you probably zoomed in either too close or too far on the map.	1

	you are two of several that highly recommend the pirelli pzero nero m+s.	1
	even though i could not get them balanced to my satisfaction, i do believe that they are a very good tire.	1
	i will emphasize again that they were very quite and they seemed to absorb some of the harsh suspension characteristics that the genesis is known for.	1
	i may give them another try about a year from now since i rack up about 33,000 miles per year.	1
	i do think that michelin's manufacturing tolerances must be tighter than other tire manufacturers.	1
	they just seem to always be perfectly round easy to balance without requiring much weight to get them balanced.	1
	i guess they should be better because they are certainly more expensive on an apples-to-apples basis!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5368#msg5368my pirelli's...        came to $814 for the four of them, mounted and balanced.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5386#msg538630,000 mile owner experience update        vehicle:  genesis 3.8 liter v6 with every available option (including tech pack and 18 wheels), black on black                                my odometer will roll past 30,000 miles within a couple of days, so here goes my owners experience update that i have posted at 5,000 mile intervals (approximately).	1
	not a lot has changed, which is mostly a good thing!	1
	i have recently posted some information pertaining to replacing the original tires so i will not rehash that here since all of you can pull up my previous posts.	1
	body (fit, finish, appearance, etc.)	1
	absolutely nothing negative to report!	1
	still rock-solid without a hint of any squeaks, rattles, or problems.	1
	engine/transmission/drivetrain                i could not be happier with the power and smoothness.	1
	i still marvel as to how a v6 can move this heavy vehicle with such ease and grace.	1
	technology package                excellent navigation system.	1
	the genesis multimedia controller is far more sophisticated and user-friendly than other brands attempt at this (including bmws idrive).	1
	after just one trip, i found it to be intuitive and easy to access a lot of things without having to reach for multiple dials and knobs.	1
	i do have one weird thing that i have previously posted on this blog.	1
	sometimes the navtraffic system displays what i call upside down information.	1
	it will correctly identify the exact location of a traffic accident by telling the road, exit, direction of travel, etc.	1
	however, it sometimes incorrectly will say that the accident is x amount of miles to the south when, in fact, it is that same amount of miles to the north.	1
	i still dont know if this is the fault of the navtraffic computer or if the information is incorrect that is being downloaded from the state department of transportation and/or state police.	1
	suspension and ride                i realize that this will start another round of arguments but trust me when i tell you that hyundai needs to make the suspension a little less harsh.	1
	i am one that likes european type handling characteristics that provide sportiness and good handling.	1
	the genesis provides both but it also jars your fillings on even mildly bumpy road surfaces.	1
	anytime the road is smooth, it is a fantastic riding and handling machine.	1
	i feel sure that they will address this in upcoming model years.	1
	be careful what kind of tires you purchase and never over-inflate them!	1
	value                in spite of the few negatives i mentioned above, at this price no other luxury sedan comes close!	1
	in a few months, i will be purchasing another vehicle for my wife.	1
	i have begun the decision process and i find myself trying to find something else that will measure up to the genesiss value.	1
	i dont want two genesises (is that how you make it plural???)	1
	but i hate to pay from $8,000 to $25,000 more and not get more!	1
	if hyundai corrects the harsh suspension, they will wax lexus, infinity, and acura, and they will take a bite out of bmw and mercedes.	1
	ill be back in about 5,000 miles (probably late september).       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5387#msg5387re: 30,000 mile owner experience update [colegar]        colegar,                                as always thank you so much for your updates, for me and many others they are very helpful and well thought out.one thing you said that comes to my mind every time i drive my genesis is********************************************                                'i could not be happier with the power and smoothness.	1
	i still marvel as to how a v6 can move this heavy vehicle with such ease and grace.'	1
	yep i still find it hard to believe  this and really see it when i take off from a stop lite.i don't lead foot it (at least not very often)but it just seems effortless from a dead stop.i really noticed it a few times recently when i drove a couple of different cars and it felt like i had to really give it a lot of gas pedal for it to move and get to cruising speed they seemed so sluggish.	1
	(both were 6cyl)                well i now have a little over 4000 mile so your post makes me happy that this is what i have to look forward to.	1
	(all things being equal) please continue your informative post,and thanks again.really i'm gonna do a road trip soon and put some miles on this great ride.......lol.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5388#msg5388re: 30,000 mile owner experience update [colegar]        colegar,                                you seem to be racking up the miles more than any of us other genesis owners.	1
	on the genesisowners.com site i have seen reports of up to 20k or so.	1
	i agree with you 100% on the ride.	1
	my car just broke 3000 miles and is going in for its first oil change next thursday.	1
	i am also having them do an alignment.	1
	it seemed off from day one, but i wasn't sure if i just wasn't used to the car.	1
	after putting some miles i am sure i have a definate drift to the left on all roads.	1
	also, the dash panel behind the turn signal lever is coming off on one side.	1
	a clip must be broken or not installed.	1
	the dealer i bought the car from was very good so far, so i am now curious as to how their service is.	1
	i asked for a loaner and was told 'no problem' with no questions asked.       	1

	enjoyed it!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5391#msg5391re: 30,000 mile owner experience update [tjc78]         replying to tjc78 , regarding alignment problems:                                i have never had to get an alignment and my tires were wearing very evenly.	1
	however, i do want to mention one thing in case it relates to your genesis drifting to the left.	1
	with the original dunlaps, i was conscience that my genesis did not like roads that had severe crowns.	1
	it seemed to pull toward the sholder on those kinds of roads.	1
	however, it does not ehibit those tendancies at all now that i have installed michelin pilot sport as plus.	1
	it is smooth and has no off-center pulling.	1
	one caveat:  before anyone considers going to this model of michelins, be aware that the already harsh ride of the genesis is even more so with the michelins.	1
	they greatly improved the handling but exacerbated the suspension stiffness.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5392#msg5392re: 30,000 mile owner experience update [colegar]        thanks colegar,                                mine was really never right from delivery.	1
	the wheel is a bit off center and even around town on level roads it pull left.	1
	you are right though, on crowned roads it will drift toward the shoulder pretty much all the time, my avalon was the same way.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5393#msg5393wait        i tried genesis v6 test drive after driving acura tl base model.	1
	i'll probably go with acura but will check first to see if 2010 genesis has resolved stiff ride problem.	1
	but i kinda like the idea of using regular gas in genesis instead of premium in acura.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5394#msg5394re: wait [mechanico]        i actually traded an acura tl in on my genesis.	1
	here are my thoughts on the pros and cons:                                *  acura is fun to drive but no quicker than the v6 genesis.	1
	*  genesis seems to have more torque on long pulls                *  acura's suspension is less harsh                *  i like rear-wheel drive better (genesis)                *  front-wheel drive is harder on tires (acura)                *  real-world gas mileage is almost the same                *  acura is hard to get in and out of in tight parking spaces                *  geneis is much roomier.	1
	no comparison for back seat passengers!	1
	*  anything made by honda is usually trouble-free (acura)                *  although too new to be proven, genesis quality appears to be great too                *  either choice will serve you well!	1
	*  genesis is much classier looking (my opinion).	1
	acura tl is a glorified honda accord (not necessarily a bad thing)!	1
	*  genesis is far more car for the money                                you are making a choice between two very good cars.	1
	go with your heart ... not my opinion or anyone else's.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5395#msg5395re: wait [mechanico]        per hyundai official, 2010 will have new bushings, springs and shocks.	1
	will it work?	1
	only time will tell.	1
	unfortunately, once a mag or website reviews a car, they seldom go back until years later.	1
	example:  consumer reports reviews in their summary magazines are sometimes actually 5 or 6 years old.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5396#msg5396re: wait [carolinabob]        i'm interested 2see if it really makes a difference and if so how much.if its really that good i may have to trade my 2009,although 2me it is noticeable i'm not that bothered by it.so it will have to be a really big improvement for me to trade,and i don't wanna have to go through the hassle of replacing all the branding logo's again.....lol.yhanks for the info.	1
	miklo       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5397#msg5397re: wait [carolinabob]        cr is notorious for long review cycles.	1
	but other mags/web sites can be more responsive, especially if the vehicle is of special interest or the manufacturer encourages the mag to re-review because of the update, provides the car etc.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5398#msg5398re: wait [carolinabob]        i would think you could tell by driving both cars.	1
	sometimes these mags have their own agenda anyway.	1
	cr is probably the least biased.       	1

	only time will tell                .	1
	welcome back bob.	1
	that was a short hiatus.	1
	i hope they don't go too far and make the genesis suspension lexus soft.	1
	that would be a shame.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5400#msg5400re: wait [bobad]        thanks.	1
	i had information that answered a question, so i thought i would share it.	1
	i think one problem hyundai might have is they are trying to compete with both lexus and bmw and the makes in between on suspension and this is probably impossible to do.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5401#msg5401re: wait [carolinabob]         they are trying to compete with both lexus and bmw and the makes in between on suspension and this is probably impossible to do                                bob,                                i assume you read about the suspension changes on the 'hyundai think tank' that is where i saw it.	1
	anyway, no car can be everything to everyone.	1
	imo they should soften the ride a touch (for the lexus/toyota crowd) then offer a full on 'touring or sport' suspension as an option for the bmw/infiniti crowd.	1
	they are in a no win situation.	1
	soften it too much and 'its too floaty like a buick/avalon' or stiffen it too much and people claim the ride is harsh and jarring.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5402#msg5402re: wait [tjc78]        what would be wonderful if hyundai could find a way to replicate the ride/handling feel of the 5 series, in a $33k sedan.	1
	great handling and ride compliance without being harsh, or floaty.	1
	i am not betting hyundai can't do it, someday.	1
	but bmw has a bit of a head start there.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5403#msg5403re: wait [tjc78]        i completely agree..'no car can be everything to everyone.'	1
	i have had my genesis for about 7 weeks now and on balance am extremely impressed by the car.	1
	i've got some minor nits - but nothing i would call very substantive.	1
	a couple are i wish all all the windows were auto up and down, that the homelink was backlit, that the passenger seat was power up/down, the dealer needs to step up their game a little to compete in this space, etc.	1
	we still have 2 acuras (mdx  rl) and have had past experiences with infiniti and lexus (+ about everyone other make) and their service depts.	1
	i would say i've had better service experience with all of them but realize that can vary.	1
	for example, i recently noticed some blotches in the nav screen when the screen is black - almost like finger tips inside from the inside (i.e, not on outside).	1
	it does not seem to impact the quality of the display so far.	1
	when i took it to the dealer they said it was working as it should and that it would need to be seen by a hyundai rep if i wanted anything to be done with it - that they could not make that decision without them seeing it.	1
	it may be a way to control warranty expenses but certainly puts the dealer in bad position if they can't make those types of calls.	1
	i will continue to watch it for now (so perhaps they accomplished their goal?!).	1
	again, i think it is a fantastic car for my needs and enjoy sharing the story with others.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5404#msg5404re: wait [backy]        hyundai is notorious for purchasing a competitor's vehicle, tearing it down, and  reverse engineering many of its components based on that design.	1
	with that said i don't see why they couldn't completely disassemble a bmw 5-series suspension and emulate it based on the genesis dimensions and specs.	1
	i believe the original post on this topic mentioned that the 2010 genesis will have new bushings, springs and shocks.	1
	i am looking forward to test driving a 2010 model to see the difference.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5405#msg5405re: wait [bman900]         with that said i don't see why they couldn't completely disassemble a bmw 5-series suspension and emulate it based on the genesis dimensions and specs.	1
	uh... patents, maybe?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5406#msg5406re: wait [backy]        not sure patent law applies in south korea.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5407#msg5407re: wait [bman900]        try googling 'patent law south korea', see what you get.       	1

	great handling and ride compliance without being harsh, or floaty.'	1
	the entire industry has been trying to replicate bmw's formula for sedan ride/handling for 40 years.	1
	some have come close, but so far nobody has cracked the code.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5409#msg5409no dog in the hunt....        i've owned the bmw.	1
	have driven the lexus ls.	1
	and had two extended test drives, of both the v6 and v8 genesis.	1
	purely a personal opinion, but the genesis splits the difference between the bmw and the lexus.	1
	it doesn't ride as hard as the bmw, nor as softly as the lexus.	1
	it won't outhandle the bmw, but will outhandle the lexus.	1
	so, those used to that ride of the lexus/camry/avalon/es350 won't like the genesis ride.	1
	those that put more emphasis on handling, aren't going to give the nod to the genesis over the bmw.	1
	in the middle sits the genesis.	1
	those who prefer the bmw or the lexus won't agree.	1
	but, those with an open mind, will be in for a treat.	1
	no way you could consider the ride of the genesis as harsh.	1
	i took both models on some terrible roads.	1
	it was firm, but far from harsh....very far.	1
	ran into a neighbor's wife last weekend.	1
	she's had a mb e series that's about 7 years old.	1
	she's looking to replace it.	1
	i told her she owed it to herself (and her husband, who's more practial than she ever will be) to drive a genesis.	1
	she asked me who made it.	1
	i told her hyundai.	1
	she practically laughed me off her drive way.	1
	she said she just put in a special order for the '10 e series, due to be delivered in oct.  price paid was $47k+.....and it doesn't even come with leather or nav.	1
	but, it does say mercedes, though.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5410#msg5410re: no dog in the hunt.... [graphicguy]        obviously more interested in keeping up appearances than anything else.	1
	guess that's worth the extra cash to some people.	1
	for me, give me more standard equipment and let me buy something else fancy with the extra cash!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5411#msg5411re: no dog in the hunt.... [graphicguy]        pure example of why brand name doesn't always means best choice.	1
	bet if she ordered it with leather and nav would've been paying close to $60k.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5412#msg5412re: no dog in the hunt.... [lashawn]        damned close: assuming we're talking an 350e - add navigation package (the cheaper one) and leather seats and you're looking at $55k+.	1
	if you go for the fancy upscale package that includes                  almost                 most of the features that are in the genny it's over $58k.	1
	go ahead and check off half the rest of the options so you get to a comparable feature-set and you're looking at more like $60k where it maxes out.	1
	add another 10% to the engine and you're gettin' really close.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5413#msg5413re: no dog in the hunt.... [graphicguy]        my every day driver is a 2006 ls 430. i have test driven the genesis a couple of times and think it is a great car.	1

	a couple of days ago we parked close to a white genesis and she remarked what a nice looking car it was !	1
	go figure.	1
	hilarious!	1
	women are so funny sometimes, aren't they?	1
	i had a similar situation happen w/ me some years ago.	1
	tried to convince my [then] girlfriend to look at a car.	1
	can't remember which or who made it.	1
	[she's one of those irritating hondaphiles.]	1
	she exclaimed it was the ugliest thing in the world.	1
	probably the next week we saw the exact same model car in a different color and she commented on how nice it was!	1
	i said, 'that's the                 exact same car                that you said was so ugly just last week, only in a different color!!'	1
	i guess the clothes really do make the man; in this case, the car.        	1

	is there an aerodynamic flaw with the genesis that hyundai hasn't addressed?	1
	at what speeds does this spoiler become effective?	1
	how much downforce is generated at 40mph?	1
	60mph?	1
	80mph?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5430#msg5430re: free painted hyundai genesis sedan roof spoiler give away [fedlawman]        there is no flaw, this is just a aftermarket part to make the car look different that's all.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5431#msg5431re: free painted hyundai genesis sedan roof spoiler give away [fedlawman]        when i got my genesis up to 172 mph i noticed a bad drift to the left,this aftermarket product is supposed to help me with this problem.im sure it works as good as the rest of the after market products i have already installed on my genesis.	1

	i'm highly skeptical of that speed since the challenger srt8 is capable of 179 off the showroom floor.	1

	i don't think the genesis will do that kind of speed.	1
	check out the pic... a magazine was having some fun with a v8 on the autobahn.	1
	or course as a goof i texted it to my gf who starting freaking out thinking i was really that crazy!	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5436#msg5436re: free painted hyundai genesis sedan roof spoiler give away [tjc78]        i really hope that was the case.	1
	why make fun of it though, just because it's something he may not add to his car?	1
	a lot of parts are made simply as a visual change to the vehicle with no performance enhancement.	1
	i see the rear window spoilers on bmw's, benz's and lexuses...and it's a really slick look when you select the right profile.	1
	personally, i like the one korean auto imports sells for the azera...low profile look and just enough to change the look of the car subtly.	1
	now i would suspect the genesis being capable of 150-155, maybe a little more.	1
	the azera can pull a little over 140.                                however, i've got my sights set on the upcoming equus!!	1

	although when i said the same thing to my salesman a few days after i bought my genesis the reaction was priceless (at least 2me).	1
	i have a friend that said to me years ago not to take myself to serious.........cuz nobody else did.as for the product i meant no disrespect and would probably add this product if i could see it on a genesis and liked it.	1
	i'm a sucker for after market products.as a lot of ppl know i enjoy this site and would not intentionally cause any harm.of course i have never had my car anywhere even near 100 mph,and don't intend to do so,that kinda stuff is best left to the pro's on the tracks.i have read many great post and got some really good info from this site,along with some not so good and some like mine.thankfully this site seems to run on auto pilot with few if any problems and very little 'flaming' if any,so again i apologize if anyone was offended and meant no disrespect to the product or to anyone.i saw that the product blog was looked at by some as 'spam' i didn't take it that way due to it is only one post and does give what could be helpful info to someone,of course this is just my opinion.god bless free speech..........it wont be missed until its gone.	1

	the 3.8 would probably be able to run a little higher than the azera, but not much... even though it has almost 30 more hp under the hood, there's a little more weight as well.	1
	the 375 hp that the 4.6 produces...i can see that pushing between 150-160.                                glad to hear you're enjoying your genesis, good luck and happy motoring!!	1

	i thought he was only being nice about the compliments.	1
	when he and his wife came for a visit and stopped over on fathers day, my son asked his aunt if shed like to go for a test drive.	1
	not his car but he asked.	1
	she comes back and says she really likes the car.	1
	again, i figured, just talk.	1
	low and behold they got a v6 about a month ago and it has the wings.	1
	they were already installed when they saw the car and my brother asked about them and was told by the sm that some people dont like the idea of their car saying hyundai, so a special package can be provided.	1
	he lives in one of those over 55 upscale gated retirement communities and when he went to the club to play tennis he was asked by one of the people there, what kind of car is that, a bentley?	1
	so, i guess it works.	1
	fwiw, i still havent seen a genny on the road.	1
	i thought i saw one in a parking lot while on vacation in myrtle beach a few weeks ago but by the time i found a parking spot and went back to look, it was gone.	1
	probably never existed.	1
	are you guys sure you have one of these machines or am i dreaming about owning one and coming to this forum?	1
	jmonroe       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5442#msg5442re: genesis wings [jmonroe]        well, j i own one (cab red pearl) and have only seen a handful (one in my neighborhood, and three others).	1
	what i have not seen is a v8 they were all sixes.	1
	as for rebadging mine is not either and i could care less.	1
	most people still don't know what it is anyway.	1
	my car just turned 4000 miles and i must say i don't love it, but i don't hate it either.	1
	hyundai's v6 can't hold a candle to the toyota v6 i came from ('06 avalon) and the ride is just ok.  it can get unsettled on bad roads and imo there is too much feedback through the steering wheel when encountering bumps.	1
	all in all its a decent car, with fantastic interior materials and bang for the buck.	1
	also, as i have said before quite possibly the quietest car i have ever ridden in, and that includs a s-class benz.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5443#msg5443no h 4me        ahh i had not thought about not seeing other genesis on the road but now that its mentioned i dont see in my city.i did remove the badging 'h' from my genesis cuz its something i have always done.i will leave the model but not the name......i even insist they dont put their company logo on my car.i once had a salesman say they cant sell me the car unless it has the dealers name on it.i said no problem i cant and wont buy the car then......see ya......funny how fast it got removed.	1
	so 4me i got all the wings in place of the 'h' except on the hood cuz there was nothing there to change......and btw i also did see a genesis at the dealer when i bought mine that had wings,but i didnt ask if it was add on or aftermarket.i have had more ppl ask me about this car than any car i have ever had b4.i just hit 5000 miles and i really do love this car,i know everyone doesnt feel this way but i do and i've owned em all over the years.sure its not the best car out there but it works 4me.	1

	it was the only color i wanted and i went to ohio to get it, although i could have been satisfied with the silver.	1
	i just needed an excuse so mrs. jmonroe didnt think i would settle for just any ole thing.	1
	hyundai's v6 can't hold a candle to the toyota v6 i came from ('06 avalon) and the ride is just ok.                                ive heard that complaint about the ride but im very satisfied with mine and so has everyone thats been in my car, and ive asked them, because ive heard about the complaints.	1
	maybe the v8 rides better.	1
	also, as i have said before quite possibly the quietest car i have ever ridden in, and that includs a s-class benz.	1
	i wont argue with that.	1
	i heard it was a quiet ride but i didnt expect it to be a silent ride.	1
	thats been the biggest surprise and no one can believe it.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5445#msg5445re: genesis wings [jmonroe]         maybe the v8 rides better.	1
	also could be i am used to pillow soft rides like avalons, town cars etc.	1
	the handling is a definately sharper than the avalon it replaced so its a tradeoff.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5446#msg5446hyundai equus        hi everyone.	1
	i last posted on this forum a year ago.	1
	because of not being allowed to test drive the newly introduced genesis in the uae at the time, i simply drove up the road and bought a lexus ls460.	1
	a week ago i discovered the equus for the first time.	1
	i was immediately curious about its purported quality and target market.	1
	i went into the hyundai dealership here to enquire as to pricing etc.	1
	and was very surprised indeed to find that hyundai's priced the equus (4.6 fully loaded) here higher than what the ls460 (fully loaded) is selling for (both cars are very similarly speced with all the bells and whistles on board).	1
	i was genuinely interested in acquiring an equus for my better half, but would rather buy another ls460 or merc s350 for her (the s350 is also lower in price than the equus, but i think that's a bit of an unfair comparison as the spec levels are quite different).	1
	can anyone shed any light on this scenario in terms of hyundai's approach hitherto to challenge the big guns by offering similarly speced and, recently, comparable quality cars at much lower prices?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5448#msg5448re: hyundai equus [lp13]        i doubt that anyone here is very familiar with pricing strategies in the uae.	1
	sounds like it might be whatever the traffic will bear.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5449#msg5449ipod cable        did everyone get a free ipod cable with their new genesis?	1
	i finally got one that the book would indicate was supposed to come with the car but the dealer notified me this was an extra.	1
	they kindly got me one without charge upon my querry however.	1
	i just wondered about other people's experience.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5450#msg5450re: ipod cable [alonzo2]        there is supposed to be a $30.00 charge for it.	1
	however, i am sure most dealers will include it in the deal.	1
	i didn't pay for mine but have seen some genesis on the dealer's lot that had them on the window sticker as an option.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5451#msg5451thanks        i guess you're right - i shouldn't expect you guys in the us to know about uae pricing strategies.	1
	subsequently, on really trying to draw the dealer into a discussion on this unusual strategy for hyundai, it turns out that they believe that the genesis has done so well in the us that the equus ought to be able to ride on that wave.	1
	interestingly, this uae dealer also told me that he has only sold 3 genesis cars in a year.	1
	i will watch with interest to see how the us success wave sells cars here in the uae, when the wave here was little more than a ripple.	1
	i suspect that this is a local strategy (if you can call it that), and not a hyundai directive.	1
	happy motoring.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5452#msg5452genesis handling in snow        i live in the midwest with 6 mo.	1

	all my vehicles have been fwd or awd so that is my only apprehension with the vehicle.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5453#msg5453re: genesis handling in snow [scrumhalf7]        personally, i would think that with the weight distribution being what it is on the genesis, it would seem throwing some really good snow tires on there would be all you need.	1
	here's a link to an article someone posted about driving the genesis in the snow...                                 day-by-day review:  2009 hyundai genesis        	1

	i have been interested in for some reason.	1
	at some point we will get an answer from someone that is driving in snow.i also wonder why ppl are more concerned with rear wheel drive, back in the day there were not any or very few front wheel drive and i remember as kid ppl using chains,snow tires and whatever else would help them,and in fact ppl got by.	1
	certainly i agree front wheel is better in snow but really i wonder how much and if its car design that is helping more?	1
	anyway the last snow i saw in tucson was about 20 years ago and didnt really stick to the road.	1
	i hope after you have your own experience this winter you will share with us and tell us how it worked and what you think.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5457#msg5457snow... turn off the esc and let em rip...        i was fortunate and purchased one of the first v8's in nj... so we get snow and i live in sparta which is sussex county in the snow belt so i get nailed.	1
	those are my qualification for talking 'snow'.	1
	to make a long story long, i owned the sonata, then the azera now the genesis.	1
	i only got rid of the azera (fwd) because of the genesis.	1
	the azera with it's beefy/heavy v6 was like a tank in the snow.	1
	never off the road and very stable.	1
	pure confidence, i passed 4 wheelers with ease.	1
	that car i left the esc on...                                the genesis (rwd), fuget about it...  first things first, kill (turn off) the esc... it will just get you stuck... you need wheel spin in snow to get you out of spots and moving... even if it is up the side of a curb, sideways of course.	1
	i just work from home on bad snow days-or take a ride with a friend that has 4 wheel drive.... the genesis is not made for the snow... but as an earlier poster mentioned, 'jeez, back in the day all cars were rwd'.	1
	i can tell you if the genesis was fwd, i would not have bought it... i bought it for the additional hp's, rwd, 17 speaker lexicon 500+ watts etc... at a song compared to it's over priced luxury competition.	1
	would i prefer awd with ability to go rwd?	1
	yes... but i will prefer rwd over fwd anytime... more fun...       	1

	wow you sure do like the hyundai,i also bought a new sonata in 2004 and was impressed across the board with that car.	1
	now with my genesis there is no comparison,i really do like this car and im another guy that hates fwd.	1
	in fairness fwd has gotten way better since it first came out but,it still sux 2me.before genesis i had a sts cady and didnt like the  all wheel drive ,whatever that means,dont get me wrong it was nice car just wasn't crazy about it and i thought i would be                .	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5459#msg5459re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [miklo]        you guys are aware that the esc is never fully 'off' turning it off (via the switch) merely reduces its intervention.	1
	if you want it totally off, you have to pull the fuse.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5460#msg5460re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        if one is concerned about a rwd car in the snow, then just get snow tires.	1
	tire rack offers some great packages for the genesis in both 17' and 18' sizes.	1
	since my family enjoys snow sports, we run winter tires and rims on both our fwd vehicles.	1
	the extra money spent ensures that we get to enjoy our free time (and our commute) without too much worry.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5461#msg5461re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [robr2]         then just get snow tires                                i agree 100%.	1
	i don't plan getting them, as here in south jersey (near philly) we don't get enough of the white stuff to worry about it.	1
	however, in other parts of the country, i can see a use for them       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5462#msg5462re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        thanks tic78... i thought it was not fully off-operated strangely... i will pull the fuse and feel the difference... thanks again.!!	1
	regarding the snow however... it works with just the switch.. i was stepping on the gas in a parking lot with a very, very slight upward incline... no movement whatsoever... the gas pedal was 'dead' i simply turned off the esc and off i went... slippin and slidin..but moving... again, the car is not a good winter car, snow tires or not...                                but i can't wait to pull the fuse after the rain here in jersey to see the difference !!	1
	i'll post again once i get dry pavement and the fuse pulled...                                have a good one...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5463#msg5463esc...        when you pull the fuse out...from a dead stop hit the brakes, floor it for a second then release the brakes...wow!!!	1
	the bad thing is that no more speedometer and good bye nav system...they don't work!	1
	it was really fun trying it though.	1
	if you want to spin the tires without removing the fuse, do the exact sequence described on top.	1
	also, i found that holding the esc button for at least 10 seconds seems to help in turning that dam thing off...                                try it and have fun.       	1

	i was out to eat earlier this evening and noticed a new loaded genesis 3.8 in the parking lot with the window sticker still attached.	1
	the dealer was giving a $3,000 discount on this particular vehicle.	1
	the original sticker price was $40,000 with a final bottom line price of $37,000.	1
	i am pretty sure this was not a pre-owned vehicle.	1
	has anyone else out there seen this?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5466#msg5466re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[bman900]        no, i don't recall seeing a car (outside a dealer's showroom) that had the dealer's discount so prominently displayed on the car.	1
	maybe one of those 'no haggle' dealerships?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5467#msg5467re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[backy]        the dealership was just down the street.... a pretty large dealership (holler hyundai in winter park, fl).	1
	i think some of the salespeople just took it to the same restaurant i was at.	1
	anyway i thought this was a pretty good discount.	1
	perhaps they are just overly anxious to clear out their 2009s.	1
	i would assume there is not much haggle room on that price.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5468#msg5468re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        wow thanks i didnt know that about the esc botton,so now if i wanna smoke the tires im gonna take out the fuse....lol.	1
	really thanks this is good 2know.	1
	miklo       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5469#msg5469re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        don't know the truth to that statement, because when i tested the 3.8 premium plus...i turned th esc off and from a stop was able to stomp the gas pedal, break the tires loose and swing the back end of the car around (like you see in the movies).	1
	it was quite fun and exhilirating, but...very easily controlled with the balance of the car.	1
	not once during this manuver did the traction control kick in and reduce throttle or anything.	1
	maybe it's something that's been changed as production has gone along.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5470#msg5470re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [allmet33]        my car is an early production model, (7/08) even though i've only had it about 5 months.	1
	anyway, there is no doubt that it isn't off.	1
	'playing around' as the tail started to slip out the system corrected the car.	1
	now, with it fully on it intervenes even sooner so the back end doesn't even move.	1
	this practice is not uncommon on chryslers it works the same way.	1
	here is a link        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5471#msg5471re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        oh...i believe you, but the model i drove was an early production model as it was when they were first sprinkling in to the dealerships.	1
	all i know is i walked away from that experience impressed with how well behaved the car handled even when pushed as i had done.	1
	i've done that with cars that took a lot to get back under control, but the genesis was very well mannered.	1
	you know...the other thing that may have something to do with it...i had the transmission in manual mode.	1
	i'm not sure if that affects how the esc works with the overall system or not.	1
	give that shot and see what happens.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5472#msg5472re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[bman900]        this is the exact car i purchased brand new at this exact price.	1
	it's real.	1
	go scoop it up!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5473#msg5473re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [allmet33]         give that shot and see what happens.	1
	in an immature moment.... i switched off the esc and really laid into it on a left turn with                 no one around                .	1
	yes, indeed, the back end did come out from me a little (with some nice tire squeel).	1
	it was very easy to control though, so i believe the esc did kick in at the end.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5474#msg5474re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [tjc78]        glad to see you finally got to enjoy that moment!	1
	not sure what the threshold is for th esc, when i did it (exactly as you did) the back wheels spun and squealed all the way through the back end breaking around past the front, then i spun the wheel into the slide to bring it back around and it was a very smooth transition back to a straight line.	1
	did you keep the tranny in auto mode or did you switch it to manual?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5475#msg5475re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [allmet33]        left it in auto mode.	1
	then i was going to switch to manual if the results weren't satisfactory.        	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5476#msg547635,000 mile owner experience update        vehicle:                 v6 black/black with tech pack and all options                                sometime next week my odometer will roll over the 35,000 mile mark, so here goes with my owner experience update that i have posted every 5,000 miles or so.	1
	in summary, i have experience only three problems thus far.	1
	although i have reported two of the three, i will mention them again so that you do not have to weed back through my previous posts:                                1.  a switch under the hood became leaned over (out of position) and created a battery drain.	1
	i assume that it was allowing the hood light to stay on when the hood was closed.	1
	although it took them a week to determine the problem, it was fixed under warranty and has not reoccurred.	1
	2.  the joy-stick toggle switch on the steering column malfunctioned and would not telescope the steering wheel either up or down, even though it would still allow the steering wheel to be tilted.	1
	the dealer had to order the part but it only took an hour or so to replace once it became available.	1
	3.  the problem with the nav traffic system giving incorrect information relative to the direction in which an accident or road obstruction exists is still occurring.	1
	i believe this to be a problem originating at xm radio since i believe that they are the ones downloading the nav-traffic data to my genesis navigation system.	1
	as i have previously reported, my display will correctly inform me of an accident at a certain location or interstate exit number, but it incorrectly tells me what direction that is from my current location.	1
	it seems to be incorrect byexactly 180 degrees.	1
	i should point out that this problem seems to be isolated to upstate south carolina because i have not experienced it on long trips in other regions.	1
	in my last two posts, i described my experience regarding the replacement of the original dunlap tires.	1
	i first went with pirelli pzero nero ms which get great reviews.	1
	they were quite and had decent handling characteristics, and they are known for achieving good wear mileage.	1
	however, i could not get them balanced to my satisfaction, even after having them swapped out for a different set.	1
	i paid a ton of money to switch to a set of michelin pilot sport a/s plus.	1
	they dramatically improved the handling and they balanced perfectly.	1
	however, anyone considering this particular tire should be forewarned of two things:  first, they exacerbate the problem the genesis has of riding too harsh on bumpy roads.	1
	secondly, on certain concrete road services (mainly new pavement), they are incredibly boisterous (noisy).	1
	on those particular surfaces, they sound like a jacked-up pickup truck with knobby off-road tires (no exaggeration)!	1
	conversely, they are very quite on other surfaces (asphalt, etc.).	1
	not much else to report.	1
	great car!	1
	best bang for the buck!	1
	great performance for a v6.	1
	great fuel mileage (27 to 30 on trips driving 80 mph).	1
	rock-solid build quality (except for the two electrical switches i discussed above).	1
	for me, the harsh ride only comes into play 10% of the time since i do a lot of trips on good surfaces.	1
	bottom line, unless i experience problems in the future, i dont know much else that measures up to the genesis for the price and i have been looking since i have another car with the lease about to expire.	1
	i may put my wife in the genesis an buy either a ford fusion hybred or a vw diesel sportwagon for myself since i am such a high-mileage driver.	1
	i am betting that we will see $4 per gallon gasoline within eighteen months!	1
	i will report back in at 40,000 miles ...       	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5478#msg5478re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [bobad]        yes, it is rediculous but i rack up 700 miles a week, most of which is commuting 130 miles per day (round trip) to work.	1
	also, i take several trips per year that range from 1,000 to 2,000 miles each (round trip).	1
	i am not aware of any other genesis owners that have rolled up this many miles but i am sure there is one out there somewhere.	1
	you can see why my car-shopping has me focusing on high-mileage options!       	1

[tjc78]        hi tic78...  ok trying to pull the fuse this morning... it's dry in nj and off to an early start.. want to be totally immature an leave smoking donuts in the parking lot... and i'm personally proud of my immaturity at 47... why would we buy fast cars if we didn't want to f around?	1
	i'm getting the coupe as soon as they come out with a convertible... sunday car...  v6 fully loaded with sports car stuff.. that version... this is what these cars are built for.	1
	at least that is what i want to use them for... and it's my money... albeit a fraction of the other luxury rip-offs.. don't lease as i don't want to worry about a scratch or a ding costing me $500 on turning it in...                                anyway, so i pull the fuse from the main box in the engine compartment (i have the v8 engine).	1
	f'n thing will not allow the car to run... i finally go it into drive, but all i got was drive and neutral... it clearly does not want me pulling this fuse.	1
	when i did put it into drive, it 'clunked'.	1
	if i pull it out before the car is started, the car will lot even start.	1
	if i start the car, pull it and then try to shift into gear it stays in park, the gear shifter is friggin locked...  there are 4 fuse boxes in my car 1) driver side interior 2) passenger side interior 3) engine compartment main 4) engine compartment supplemental overflow... it appears i pulled the right fuse but many refer to esc or some other variation on the terms.	1
	the one i pulled was a 15 amp out of the main box called tcu (traction control unit).	1
	i welcome your advice on getting around this..                                thanks...       	1

	anyway, a few posts above i posted a link to the genesisowners.com website.	1

	speak with your local tire expert-if he is honest he will tell you they are essentially not needed today as tire technology has come such a long way.	1
	short of going off road or something...... imho, and research work, they are  a waste of money and tire companies continue to manufacture them as they get to sell more tires... just drive safe on regular high tech tires and your fine... if it's a blizzard, stay home or use another vehicle.	1
	i have the 2007 santa fe with the big v6... just fwd... the thing goes through anything... i use that if i need to get out in a blizzard... if you want them... go for it !	1

	but that's all... careful driving is the most important factor, not the tire... i 'choose' not to put 'snow tires' on this or any luxury sports sedan.	1
	i have other options.. if this is your only vehicle and you must drive it in the snow, then snow tires may be the right move for you.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5490#msg5490re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[bman900]         the dealer was giving a $3,000 discount on this particular vehicle.	1
	the original sticker price was $40,000 with a final bottom line price of $37,000.	1
	this price should not be a surprise at the end of a model year.	1
	since you saw it at a restaurant, it could have been a car driven by the sm with more than just a few miles on it.	1
	im not bragging because the price i paid for my genny was advertised to everybody via the internet site of the dealer i bought from in ohio.	1
	it was a good price as far as i was concerned although i tried to buy the car for less because my experience with internet prices (05 and 06 purchases) is that it is a good starting point but not this time.	1
	the guy would not budge on his internet price and like i said i thought it was a good price as advertised.	1
	thats why i drove 120 miles to ohio from the burgh to get my v8 genny in march that had an msrp of $42,100 for $38,141.	1
	markdowns at the end of the model year are common.	1
	good prices in the middle of the year are not so common.	1
	thats why i grabbed the deal i got when it appeared.	1
	fwiw, i checked that web site for 3 months after i bought in march and the price rose every month.	1
	i think that can be attributed to when the sun starts to shine and sales typically pick up.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5491#msg5491re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[jmonroe]        i've found over the years that the lowest new car prices seem to come in march.	1
	i know there's some good deals at the end of the year also, but for some reason march is a real good month to buy a new car, in general.	1
	i don't know if that's because of slow sales early in the year, or that it coincides with the local auto show and special rebates offered at that time, or just what it is.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5492#msg5492re: genesis $3000 discount?	1
	[backy]        march slow sales are due to everyone preparing to pay uncle sam on april 15.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5493#msg5493oh...        i don't know about that.	1
	i bought my 2008 mitsubishi lancer gts in rally red on march 21, 2007.                                but that was because i was just chomping at the bit to buy one asap!	1
	was told by the avondale mitsubishi sales manager that i was the 2nd person in arizona to buy a '08 lancer gts model.	1

	[carolinabob]        imo generally winter months are better, however if you ask many guys in the biz the last day or two of any month is usually good.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5497#msg5497re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [colegar]        thanks for your posts.... this is great unbiased 'real' information we would not otherwise get from other sources.	1
	most of the testdrives by the professional automative editors indicate the genesis v6 has ample power in most everyday driving conditions.	1
	in your 35,000 miles of driving experience with the 3.8 litre engine, were there any times that you wished you had the 4.6?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5498#msg5498re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [bman900]        i originally was trying to wait for the v8 to be introduced but once i drove the v6, i did not see any reason to wait.	1
	as i have posted here in the past, i have owned several luxury brands and a few real 'performance' cars (bmw, mercedes, lexus, acura, etc.)	1
	and i am not one to tolerate sluggishness.	1
	i don't want to make the genesis 3.6 out to be as good as a bmw 335i or the like, because it is not.	1
	however, for any kind of 'normal' driving, it performs great.	1
	when the first v8 genesis arrived at my dealer, he invited me to take it out for a test drive.	1
	yes, the v8 has a little more of a 'premium' feel and at very high speeds it moves out with more authority than my v6.	1
	surprisingly, it did not feel that much quicker at anything less than 80 mph.	1
	if you read the road test reviews, the experts comment on the fact that the v6 can hit 60 mph in around six seconds with the v8 only getting there a tic or two sooner.	1
	i have also commented several times about how well mated the transmission is to the v6.	1
	i am convinced that the transmission is at least partially responsible for how well the v6 performs.	1
	would i rather have a v8?	1
	yes.	1
	do i drive around disappointed that i went ahead with the purchase of the v6?	1
	absolutely not!       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5499#msg5499re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [bman900]        the 3.8 is fine as far as acceleration, however just don't expect it to be as refined as the toyota 3.5 (2gr) or a bmw 6.  its not nearly as free revving and doesn't have the smoothness at higher rpm.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5500#msg5500re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [tjc78]        i agree with you when comparing the genesis 3.8 to a bmw 6, but i do not agree that the toyota 3.5 compares favorably.	1
	it so happens that i have both the genesis and a toyota with that engine and i find the genesis to feel like a bigger, more capable engine.	1
	you are correct that the toyota is very quick-revving but i find it to be a lot more 'buzzy' and it has less torque, especially when driving in the mountains.	1
	comparing any six to a bmw 6 is not a fair fight.	1
	the feel and sound of the bmw six is just simply in a class of its own!	1
	ain't it funny how we can all have different takes on the same comparisons?	1
	that's what evokes so much passion from those of us who love cars.	1
	there may be more people that agree with your opinion than mine.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5501#msg5501re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [colegar]        i think we may have discussed this before.	1
	fwiw i am comparing my genesis to my previous '06 avalon.	1
	that car (while absolutely no sports car) had such authority on takeoff and passing situations.	1
	the 3.8 feels like (to me) its chugging along with no sense of urgency.	1
	another thing i noticed on the toyota was that while cruising at say 70 to make a subtle change in speed the toyota never had to kick down a gear where the genesis is always downshifting.	1
	i only have 4500 miles, so maybe its not fully broken in yet?       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5502#msg5502re: 35,000 mile owner experience update [tjc78]        i can tell that you are a knowledgeable car man and i respect your opinion.	1
	i'm not sure why we view the comparison differently but at least we are talking about two very good vehicles from a value standpoint.	1
	one thing for sure ... the avalon will go forever without problems.	1
	i plan to drive my genesis for about 100,000 miles which i will achieve in about three years.	1
	i hope that i will be reporting that it too can rack up a lot of miles without any significant issues.	1
	there are two reasons that i plan to trade at around 100k.	1

	the closer spacing between gears makes the engine rev quicker, of course.	1
	but look at the track test times for the genesis 3.8 and avalon: the genesis is about  0.1 to 0.2 seconds quicker to 60 mph than the avalon.	1
	with passing, the avalon might be slightly quicker from 40 to 60, or 70 to 90 (again, the shorter gear ratios), but keep the pedal to the floor in both cars, and the genesis will still be quicker accelerating from 40 to 80, and from 70 to 100+.	1
	another thing that affects how 'quick' a car feels is the calibration of the electronic throttle.	1
	a more sensitive throttle will make a car feel quicker, especially from a stop.       	1

[dczark]        fedlawman,                i may get blasted for having a similar opinion as you but, although it has been many years ago while in the army in fairbanks alaska we did not use snow tires.i drove a dodge pickup truck,and a sedan that i cant remember model....lol it was long ago.my point is that out in the boonies i think they were used some,what we did was in fact buy the very best tires available at that time,of course i will concede that there probably is a slight advantage,but it wasn't enough for us to warrant all the trouble involved.	1
	im not sure now what is done but when i was a kid while my dad was in the service after snow many ppl made it a point to remove snow tire, and return to regular tire.	1
	let me say up front this is just my opinion as i have lived in tucson,arizona for many,many years and we dont need em here.i have always believed and was taught in the army that its how you drive in snow that matters most,and i also believe that it is just a ploy for the most part by tire companies to give ppl a false sense of security when they buy snow tires.	1
	sure ya can find pro and con viewpoint on the net (on any subject) about snow tires,but imho its a matter of skill and preference.	1
	now 4me the only thing i miss about snow is doin donuts in the parking lots.....and maybe im just to old to try again anyway......nah i still would do it ....lol.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5509#msg5509re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [miklo]        snow tires when combined with careful driving makes for a great combination.	1
	i run snows on dedicated rims on both our vehicles from november to march.	1
	we enjoy snow sports and winter hiking/camping and having snows makes it more enjoyable.	1
	it's not just about driving in a blizzard.	1
	the more plausible scenario is driving on hard packed snow and ice.	1
	that's where snow tires shine.	1
	the main issue i see with running all-season tires in winter is that most people don't inspect or realize how bad their tires are.	1
	by swapping twice a year, i visually inspect my tires for wear and damage.	1
	bad tires and bad weather - even just rain - don't mix.	1
	if one is considering snows today, the rule is run them on all four corners to ensure equal grip.	1
	as for snow tires being a marketing opportunity, i disagree.	1
	many european countries as well as quebec require the use of snow tires.	1
	studies have shown them to be more effective when driving on packed snow.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5510#msg5510re: snow... turn off the esc and let em rip... [miklo]        what robr2 said...       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5511#msg5511re: best time to purchase?	1
	[tjc78]        supposedly the absolute optimum time would be december 31, 30 minutes before closing time.	1
	but as you say, last day of the month, end of the day is good because the dealer, sales manager, floor manager and salesman all need something up on the scoreboard for the month.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5512#msg5512re: best time to purchase?	1
	[carolinabob]        maybe not.	1
	if a dealer has already made its targets for the month/quarter/year at 8:30 pm on 12/31, or has no hope of making them even with several more sales, i can see they wouldn't be inclined to give the world's best deal.	1
	so i agree with the approach that a couple days before month/quarter/year end is a better time to buy a car than the last minute, in general.	1
	probably better selection then, also.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5513#msg5513re: best time to purchase?	1
	[backy]        well...two ways to think on that...find the salesman that hasn't made his quota yet and talk with him.	1
	he'll do whatever it takes to make the deal go through.	1
	also, even if a salesman has made his quota, he'll still be inclined to work a good deal because there's bonuses for sales above quotas too.	1
	another great time to find a good deal is when lots are right before dealerships bring in the new model years.	1
	they want to clear space, so they cut prices, offer incentives and make deals that are better than normal.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5514#msg5514re: best time to purchase?	1
	[allmet33]         find the salesman that hasn't made his quota yet and talk with him                                at many dealerships the salesman isn't in control of the deal--the sales manager is.	1
	and the quota is a quota for the whole dealership.	1
	under these conditions, you have to get to the sales manager in order for the price to move at all.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5515#msg5515re: best time to purchase?	1
	[stephen987]        you're absolutely right, but the salesman will do his best to implore him to make it a deal if he really needs that sale.	1
	yes, dealerships have overall quotas, but sales people have individual quoatas that feed their paycheck.	1
	the more they sell, the bigger their check and most dealers offer bonuses for those that sell beyond their target quota.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5516#msg5516re: best time to purchase?	1
	[allmet33]        sales guys i've talked to don't get commissions on cars that don't meet minimum dealer profit.	1
	quota is only one aspect of willingness to deal, but you've got to leave some room for it to be worth his effort.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5517#msg5517re: best time to purchase?	1
	[poodog13]        in this case...the genesis, i'm sure would meet the criteria.	1
	quota may only be one aspect, but it is an aspect and don't be fooled by a salesperson telling you that he'll turn down a chance to make a sale.	1
	point blank, it equates to money in his pocket.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5518#msg5518re: best time to purchase?	1
	[allmet33]        how do you figure that a sales guy who sells a car at a loss gets money in his pocket as a result, unless in fact the dealership has authorized some sort of inventory reduction event?	1
	i work in sales.	1
	if that is the case, i need to go work for that dealership.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5519#msg5519re: best time to purchase?	1
	[poodog13]        first of all, i never said anything about making a sale at a loss.	1
	i simply said making a good deal.	1
	also, in terms of the post i made about going in right before the dealership is bringing in the new model year cars...that's usually when inventory reduction events happen to make room for the new cars coming in.	1
	at any rate, sales people work on commission.	1
	i'm sure the commission is affected by the overall deal made on the vehicle, but the point is...the sales person gets paid for cars sold...bottom line.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5520#msg5520re: best time to purchase?	1
	[backy]        all of these are theories and subject to varying circumstances.	1
	several articles have been written in professional magazines, etc.	1
	re: the december and last day of the month, end of day scenarios.	1
	of course, you are restricted to what is on the lot.	1
	also, for many dealerships/sales people, it is not just a quota, so much as who sold how many last month or last quarter, etc.	1
	every sale counts.	1
	also, some salesmen have told me that they get a flat $500 for every car sold or the higher commission if they sell it at a larger profit.	1
	at many dealerships, the cars on the lot are carrying loans, so getting rid of it before the next payment is due will save the dealer money.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5521#msg5521re: best time to purchase?	1
	[carolinabob]        i understand all that.	1
	i was simply expressing my opinion that a buyer has better odds of getting the all time best deal ever a couple of days before month/quarter/year end than 30 minutes before close on the last day.	1
	there are better odds that special incentives for reaching a target sales goal are still in force, or are reachable.	1
	we can just agree to disagree on that.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5522#msg5522re: best time to purchase?	1
	[backy]        as you said, and as usual, it's your opinion and yours alone.	1
	also, that it is the 'all time best deal ever' timeframe is something only god knows.       	1

	if you read back through the forum there are a lot of driving impressions etc.	1
	anyway, i have had mine for around 5 months and have 4700 miles.	1
	to date the car hasn't had any problems other than an alignment that was off when delivered.	1
	fit and finish and the interior materials are really nice at this price point.	1
	the car is comfortable and very quiet.	1
	i find the ride to be good on smooth roads, however, imo the ride easily becomes unsettled and transmits the bumps through the steering wheel on bad roads.	1
	it all really depends what you are used to.	1
	i came from an '06 avalon so to me the ride is a disappointment.	1
	before buying this car be sure to drive it on the roads you drive on everyday.	1
	handling is decent for a car this large and can be pushed pretty hard if you want to,                                as for features, etc no compaints at all.	1
	the mid-level 14 speaker lexicon is great, the a/c is strong, and the bluetooth, smart key etc all work as designed.	1
	i am averaging 20 mpg with the v6.	1
	it has a decent amount of power, not neck snapping, though.	1
	its also not quite in the league of other v6s out there but fairly refined.	1
	i would say its better than ford's 3.5 but not as good as a toyota 2gr.	1

	[bobad]        well i think the best time 2buy is when ya get the best deal....lol but no way 2tell when that really will be imo.	1
	i bought my genesis last january,i really was just kinda looking but they were really hard up to make a sale, and i had looked at the car b4 on net as far as price....etc.	1
	really i threw an offer at them that i thought was almost impossible for them to accept,and guess what they did,so i bought the car and have loved every minute of it since then.btw as some ppl may know,you can find price the dealer paid for the car by getting an account at consumer affairs mag.	1
	for $14.00 and it takes all the guess work an hassle out of buying a car.well at least it did 4me and some other ppl i know.	1
	so go get a new genesis 2day and enjoy life while your still alive and able 2enjoy.	1

	/direct/view/.f12c019/5529#msg5529re: best time to purchase?	1
	[bobad]        actually i heard this approach from another experienced car shopper, who learned it from someone who is a professional car buyer (shops for other people, for a fee).	1
	so it's not 'my opinion and mine alone.'	1
	but what a great way to diss someone's opinion--saying that he is the only person in the world who thinks that way, thus everyone else must agree with the alternate opinion.	1
	there are actually many theories on this subject.	1
	here's one that might fly in the face of normal thinking, but i can understand where the author is coming from:                                  don't go at month's end:                  going to a dealer at the end of the month is not effective.	1
	people rush to buy during this period, so dealers have higher traffic and their own 'supply' of customers.	1
	it's more effective to go at the beginning of the month, especially on a sunny day when fewer people will venture into a dealership.	1
	remember, salespeople love to start the month with high sales.	1

	it all really depends what you are used to.	1
	i came from an '06 avalon so to me the ride is a disappointment.	1
	before i start, let me say im not arguing with you but ive heard you say this before so ive paid particular attention to this after i first heard you say this.	1
	nobody drives over a more wash-board road that i do on my way to and from work everyday and ive not noticed this transmission of road bumps through the steering wheel.	1
	of course i feel the bumps but the car has a very solid ride over this short stretch of road.	1
	ill admit that my 05 hyundai xg 350 has a smother ride over this road but it rolls a little bit more but, like i said, the xg 350 has a smoother ride.	1
	maybe i dont have the steering wheel effect because i have the v8.	1
	i dont know this for a fact because ive never driven the v6 genny.	1
	all in all, im very satisfied with this car but its still a baby.	1
	it only has about 8000 miles on it since i got it in march.	1
	as for power, it doesnt lack a thing there.	1
	i have to use cruise control on the pa turnpike every day; otherwise id have a pile of tickets.	1
	without cruise control i have to work at holding it under 80 because it rides so smooth and quiet.	1
	it literally jumps up over 90 when i step on it for a few seconds to pass a string of cars from the 70 mph cruise control setting.	1
	pretty soon ill find out how it does in the snow.	1
	im not expecting much because i didnt buy it to act like a snow plow, just for what it is; a very nice 4 door sedan.	1

	the v8 does have a different steering system than the v6.	1
	what i notice is that when encountering rough roads or bigger bumps the steering wheel does jerk to the left or right slightly.	1
	there are certainly cars that do it a lot worse.	1

	what are you talking about?????	1
	by your own logic here you are thinking that i wanted a true sports sedan...  wrong!	1
	coming from an avalon, i was ready for something a little sportier which is what the genesis offers.	1
	hyundai has and does market the genesis as a sports sedan.	1
	what i critcize the genesis for is how the ride can become unsettled due to its suspension tuning.	1
	it has made me realize that i prefer a soft riding car at the expense of handling.	1
	was it a mistake, maybe, but not for the reasons you are speculatiing, if anything the direct opposite.	1
	so....  you couldn't be more off base in your statement above.	1
	do a little research and read what people say in context before flaming.	1
	btw here is a quote from the initial release of the genesis;                                 hyundai has introduced the vehicle worldwide, known internally as the bh model, and has initially market the genesis as a 'premium sports sedan'                                another thing for you to check out would be the genesis's e-brochure the opening line is                 if you could build the perfect sports sedan                                 e-brochure        	1

	personal or real?	1
	i've read a wide array of comments regarding the good, bad, and ugly of the genesis' suspension and am left wondering whether it's the reaction of individuals to a suspension that differs from their prior rides or a genuinely poorly designed suspension.	1
	i had an m35 sport; harsh but sporty and acceptable ride, fun to drive.	1
	i now have an m35 base; smoother yet still a bit on the harsh side (surely not a q45 ride).	1
	i've driven several genesis (is the plural genesi?)	1
	and find it significantly smoother on all surfaces than my m.  yes, three of the four demo cars i drove had front end balance problems but those should be readily resolved and do not constitute a knock on the car's suspension.	1
	i have also read that the oe tires are dunlops, and harsh as stones.	1
	are they part of the problem?	1
	has anyone swapped out for michelins, bridgestones, or some other flavor that's softer?	1

	[oldidr]        mine are more personal than anything.	1
	i do not believe there are any problems with the genesis's suspension in a design/mechanical sense.	1
	part of the problem is that on good roads the car rides extremely quiet and smooth.	1
	this is your first impression, however, to eliminate body roll and improve handling they firmed up the car.	1
	this is my problem, on harsh roads the genesis transmits more of a 'thump' into the cabin than i like.	1
	like i have said in every other post about this i am comparing it to two previous avalons and a bunch of other soft riding sedans.	1
	there have been other posters here and on other forums who believe the suspension to be defective and poorly designed.	1
	i have read on the 'hyundai think tank' that for 2010 the suspension will be revised.	1
	what that means remains to be seen.	1
	it does show that hyundai has listened to what people are saying and that is very impressive.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5539#msg5539oil        on a different issue, has anyone changed their own oil?	1
	i had some time to kill today so decided to see how hard it would be.	1
	if there is an easier car to change the oil i am not aware of it.	1
	hyunda certainly does not encourage you to turn any bolts yourself and gives you no clue that the engine sound cover pops off without the need to use a single tool.	1
	the cartridge containing the filter comes right off from its position on the top of the engine.	1
	the gaskets(o rings) are easy to change and the strip resistant plug with its own slip ring is thoughtful.	1
	you can use a single 5 quart oil container to replace the oil.	1
	it takes about 15 minutes.	1
	as johnny bench once said 'no runs, no drips, no errors.'	1
	give it a try.	1
	it's fun.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5540#msg5540genesis engine cover        thanks for your input.	1
	can you be more specific on just how you 'pop' the engine cover.	1
	i am afraid to pull to hard.	1

	[oldidr]        bart, regarding your question about tire options for the genesis, i think i can add some legitimate comments since i have driven a genesis more miles (36,500) than anyone on this forum or any other that i have read.	1
	i have also done as much on-car testing of tire options as anyone.	1
	ironically, i probably will go back to the original equipment dunlops at around 60,000 miles.	1
	they don't handle as well as the michelin pilot sport a/s plus that i have on the car now and they are not as quite or compliant-riding as the pirelli pzero nero ms that i originally chose to replace the dunlops, but the dunlops are actually a good happy medium.	1
	get ready to hear some of our forum members challenge me about saying anything good about the dunlops but i actually had a good experience with them until i ruined one of them by hitting an object in the road.	1
	the michelins exacerbate the harsh ride on bumpy roads and they are very noisy on fresh, newly paved concrete surfaces, but they greatly enhance the handling of the genesis.	1
	you should also be aware that they are 'directional' and can only be rotated front-to-back (but not to the opposite side).	1
	the pirellis mentioned above get rave reviews but i could not get them balanced to my satisfaction and switched them out for the michelins after 2,700 miles.	1
	if i were not so anal about tire balancing, the pirellis would be my pick of the liter!	1
	now here is the best advice about tires of any brand on a genesis.	1
	do not over inflate them unless you enjoy a lot of suspension feedback on rough streets!	1
	i have been vocal about the genesis suspension leaving something to be desired on rough streets.	1
	you mentioned that you have had m35's and i agree that they too are very stiff riding.	1
	my problem is that i keep comparing my genesis to the bmw 5-sieries that i had which was very sporty and handled like a demon but was less harsh on bumpy, undulating surfaces.	1
	that only comes into play for me about 10% of the time because i like the genesis suspension out on the open road.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5542#msg5542re: genesis engine cover [grichie]         i am afraid to pull to hard.	1
	i have the v8 but i have not had a problem 'popping' it off the few times i tried.	1
	just grab it at each of the 4 corners and give it a steady pull upwards.	1
	it's tight (you don't want it coming off from vibration) but it comes right off.	1
	it's an easier way to get the shroud off than un-screwing 4 bolts like i had on my 06' sonata v6.	1
	i doubt that you'll break anything.	1
	btw, the v8 has the filter (cartridge type) on the bottom of the engine, although the service adviser????	1
	swore up and down it was on the top of the engine under the shroud.	1
	obviously he hadn't seen a v8 but was more than willing to pass on bum dope.	1
	jmonroe       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5543#msg5543re: genesis engine cover [grichie]        sure, you just pull straight up.	1
	the two pressure sensitive plunger type fasteners on on the left side of the engine as you face the car.	1
	don't pull too hard on the right side.	1
	with your left hand knuckels resting on the manifold(when the engine is cool) just flex your fingers and push it straight up.	1
	it pops right off.	1
	i doubt you could hurt it.	1
	if you pull to much on the right side it tends to cantilever the cover to the left since there are no fasteners on the right side.	1
	have fun.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5544#msg55442010 suspension changes        per cars.com, the 2010 genesis will be tweaking the suspension - 'hyundai has also made changes to the suspension that aims to improve ride quality without compromising handling performance'.	1
	it will be interesting to see how this addresses some of the complaints in the 2009 suspension being unsettled over less than perfect road surfaces.	1
	the 2010 models should be at dealers within the next few weeks.	1
	i would be curious to see some posts from people familiar with the 2009 model who testdrive the 2010.  i can't imagine any drastic differences, but we will see.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5545#msg5545re: 2010 suspension changes [bman900]        i'm wondering if it'll merely be component tweaks or if they'll upgrade it to the adjustable air suspension the equus will have.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5546#msg5546re: 2010 suspension changes [allmet33]        from everything i read on the hyundai think tank and other genesis websites it is purely component tweaks.	1
	the architecture stays the same.       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5547#msg5547genesis acceleration and blue tooth issues...        i've been driving a 2009 v6 with all options for a year now and love the car.	1
	i get lots of compliments and lookers.	1
	a couple things i'd like to know if anyone else has experienced:                                - the car hesitates on take off from a full or almost full stop.	1
	doesn't seem to improve with higher octane fuel.	1
	anyone had this issue and resolved it?	1
	- the bluetooth function keeps dropping/disconnecting the phone (an lg dare) and often won't pair or connect.	1
	the phone works fine otherwise...so i suspect it's in the genesis system.	1
	anyone else?	1
	- i also got a notice regarding a recall/service notice that they told me dealt with the gps system....anyone have any info on that?	1
	thanks!	1
	enjoy the ride!	1
	jj       	1
	/direct/view/.f12c019/5548#msg5548re: genesis acceleration and blue tooth issues... [genesis57]         the car hesitates on take off from a full or almost full stop                                blame that on the transmission logic.	1
	the car tends to upshift while coasting down and then there is a slight delay in downshifting when looking to accelerate.	1
	toyotas are notorious for this, although i don't remember my '06 avalon doing it as often.	1
	if you get used to it, you can just about eliminate with very light peddle pressure when accelerating from a rolling stop.	1
	the bluetooth function keeps dropping/disconnecting the phone (an lg dare)                                i don't have the tech package but my lg dare never drops from the bluetooth unit up by the dome light.	1
	so, as you suggest it may be the unit in the car.	1
	also, check your phone and make sure that the bluetooth power is set to on.	1
	if it is the phone should automatically connect every time you start your car.       	1

	personal or real?	1
	[colegar]        you know, another possible solution is to avoid 'high performance' tires altogether and switch to a premium 'touring tire.'	1
	when my company car (a not so late-model ford taurus) needed new tires last year, i did some research and selected the goodyear assurance comfortred as a replacement with the hopes that it would quiet the ride and smooth the jitters.	1
	this tire surpassed my wildest expectations - so much so that, when the oe michelin tires on my personally owned 2004 volvo v70 needed replacing, i bought a set for it.	1
	well, i have no regrets.	1
	the volvo is a smooth and quiet tourer to begin with, and the goodyears managed to raise the bar and improve all of the volvo's ride qualities.	1
	i also had a similar experience on my 2001 volvo v70 (which was totaled in an accident 5 years ago) when i replaced the oe michelin tires with bridgestone turanza tires.	1
	and no, i have no complaints with the grip and cornering ability of either of these tires (and i have some experience with performance cars and tires - being the owner of a track-worthy bmw m3).	1
	for a luxury-slanted car like the genesis (or my volvo), there is no sacrifice in driving dynamics by switching to a velvety smooth riding tire.       	1

	[fedlawman]         you know, another possible solution is to avoid 'high performance' tires altogether and switch to a premium 'touring tire.'	1
	agreed, i also moved from high perf tires to the gy comfortreds when my oem tires ran out on my personal vehicle (not a genesis), and found them to be quieter, better able to absorb rough road, and longer wearing.	1
	i've got a fairly heavy foot and live in an area with many windy roads, and i haven't noticed much if any change in performance.	1
	in fact, with the number of potholes and bumps we have, i feel like these actually do a better job of absorbing those imperfections and sticking to the road instead of causing bounce.       	1
